if cotton 's story is to be believed , he was born around 1927 , making him about 70 in the first season of the show little is known about cotton 's childhood other than that he started out with a gun at an early age according to hank in the episode '' how to fire a rifle without really trying '' , that he attended fort birk when he was very young and spent much of his childhood there as he revealed in '' an officer and a gentle boy '' , that he apparently joined the army when he was only 14 years old as revealed in '' shins of the father '' , and that cotton 's mother apparently died giving birth to him , as he exaggerates in '' death picks cotton '' almost nothing is known about cotton 's father , except that he may have been german , as peggy tells bobby in the episode '' tears of an inflatable clown '' and the only time cotton ever himself refers to his father during the entire series is when he shouts at hank : '' you ai n't my daddy , i 'm your daddy ! '' he consistently reminded everyone within earshot about how he lost his shins during world war ii : '' i was 14 , just a little older than bobby aside from some confirmation from his war buddies , it is unknown if cotton actually ever served in europe , considering the 77th served in the pacific theater and the majority of his war flashbacks are shown to take place in the pacific fighting the japanese ( '' cotton 's plot '' ) he had also learned to stop his heartbeat , so the japanese would stop torturing him for a moment , probably at the p.o.w before leaving japan , cotton had an affair with a japanese nurse , michiko , which resulted in the birth of his eldest son ( and hank 's older half-brother ) , junichiro ( voiced by david carradine ) ; he left suddenly despite trying to stay , and knew nothing of his child until years later ( a flashback clip shows him being clubbed and dragged onto the troopship leaving japan ) he also made peace with junichiro 's mother , who tore a picture taken of them as young adults after world war ii in halfâ€”and gave the half with her picture to cotton , while keeping his picture for herself cotton claimed he divorced from hank 's mother , tilly , because he '' outgrew '' her after she lost her large rear end , though it had been stated earlier in the show - such as in the season 1 episode '' shins of a father '' - that tilly divorced him after years of verbal abuse in spite of all this , however , cotton never hesitated to refer to hank as '' my boy , '' and on several occasions tried to help him ( such as when kahn and minh were befouling his house ) throughout the series , cotton has also shown several times that he may actually care for hank , such as calling him a good son in '' returning japanese '' , saving him from being shot in the episode '' yankee hankee '' , and leaving and trusting hank with his last requests and personal possessions in '' serving me right for giving george s it is likely cotton treats hank horribly simply because he hates various aspects of hank 's life , such as his job as a propane salesman , his place of birth ( new york ) , his personality , how he chooses to raise bobby , his marriage to peggy , how he is different from his cousin dusty , how hank thwarted his plan to assassinate fidel castro ( tilly had went into labor just as cotton was about to kill the communist leader ) , and - most importantly - how hank did not follow in his father 's footsteps and become a war hero in '' how to fire a rifle without really trying '' , he comes to watch bobby and hank shoot in a father-son shooting competition , stating , '' i 'm always here to support my bobby '' in '' revenge of the lutefisk '' , cotton even goes so far as to take the blame for bobby after bobby confesses he was the one who burned down the church ( claiming '' i 'm an old man , everyone already hates me ! '' whereas bobby is just a child and has his whole life ahead of him reflecting on cotton 's relationship with his grandson in '' death picks cotton , '' hank states , '' even though he hates most things , he does love bobby although cotton respects bobby more than anyone in the family , on his deathbed in '' death picks cotton '' , cotton claims he does not love anyone , though this could be him just trying to sound tough throughout his history on the series , cotton never once addressed peggy by name , but he instead called her '' hank 's wife '' , which was used as a running gag , including on the very rare occasion he 's trying to be nice to her ( the only other name cotton had ever addressed peggy by was '' hillary '' in the episode '' shins of the father '' ; peggy also did n't seem to care being called '' hank 's wife '' beyond visible annoyance , and never once told cotton not to call her that ) he even attempts to pass on some of his sexist traits to bobby at one point , teaching him that women should be made to cook and clean for their husbands all day long on rare occasions , cotton shows a vulnerable side that he normally keeps hidden : he realizes that he was a terrible father and person , hates himself for growing old and becoming disabled , and readily admits that he would die to protect his grandson , bobby ( '' revenge of the lutefisk '' ) it was never revealed throughout the series how cotton became such a nasty and rude character , or if he ever was a different person whatever the reason is , cotton never sought forgiveness for how he treated hank , peggy , tilly , and many others throughout the series the last person to see him alive is peggy , who tells him that despite cotton 's constant torture of his son , hank has always loved him and that she hopes he will live forever in the friendless , spiteful existence he has made for himself as the unhappy , unpleasant person he is peggy does not tell hank of this exchange ; instead , she lies that cotton 's last words were kind ones meant for hank hank initially plans to honor a separate wish , to have cotton 's head detached from his body and sent to the emperor of japan , but peggy stops him by ( falsely ) claiming that cotton withdrew the request just before his death he was to have been buried at the texas state cemetery , a grave which he earned in recognition of his military service , as explained by the episode '' cotton 's plot '' , although he ended up being cremated instead hank completed every single one of the humiliating requests , which hank felt was cotton 's way of humiliating hank one last time as a result of this , peggy claims at the end of the episode that even though cotton is dead , he will always find a way to disrupt their lives
