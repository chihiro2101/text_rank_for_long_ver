although the majority of the pennsylvania dutch were protestant , their folk religious culture was deeply rooted in practices of the pre-reformation era , such as the veneration of the saints , the use of folk adaptations of liturgical blessings for everyday purposes , and the use of sacred objects and inscriptions for healing and protection evidence suggests that the term was applied to the pennsylvania dutch out of a perceived similarity in ritual healing , consistent with its borrowed meaning in english for '' conjuration performed for the cure of diseases and other purposes the tradition is also called braucherei , or simply brauche , in pennsylvania dutch ; an adept is referred to as a '' powwower '' or braucher , though not all practitioners use the same terminology the bible is considered the most important book of the powwow , and no practitioner would work without their bible on hand however , the majority of practitioners were superstitiously fearful of this work and believed it invoked all manner of evil and devilry , as explained in the red church by author and braucher christopher bilardi an excerpt from the sixth and seventh books of moses , which many powwowers find as justification for the christian practice of powwowing , reads : one thing must not be omitted , in conclusion , and that is , we must first become christians before we can perform cures by christian methods the art of healing , according to scriptural principles , deserves special mention in this place , in more than one respect , not only because something truly magical takes place therein , but because scriptural healing is often regarded as the only true one people who practiced powwowing were often women who used prayer as well as locally accepted folk remedies
