ilm al-kalām , literally the study of '' speech '' or '' words '' ) is the islamic philosophy discipline of seeking theological principles through dialectic as the sunnah became published and accepted , philosophy separate from muslim theology was discouraged due to a lack of participants during this period , traditions similar to socratic method began to evolve , but philosophy remained subordinate to religion a pupil , wasil ibn ata ( ad 700–748 ) , who was expelled from the school of hasan of basra because his answers were contrary to then-orthodox islamic tradition and became leader of a new school , and systematized the radical opinions of preceding sects , particularly those of the qadarites the mutazilities , compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox islam of their day , looked for support in philosophy , and are one of the first to pursue a rational theology called ilm-al-kalam ( scholasticism ) ; those professing it were called mutakallamin this appellation became the common name for all seeking philosophical demonstration in confirmation of religious principles throughout history , the place of kalam in islamic thought has been controversial from the 9th century onward , owing to caliph al-ma'mun and his successor , greek philosophy was introduced among the arabs , and the peripatetic school began to find able representatives among them ; such were al-kindi , al-farabi , avicenna , and averroes , all of whose fundamental principles were considered as criticized by the mutakallamin they contributed to making aristotle known in christian europe one other part of aristotle 's theory shocked the faith of the mutakallamin & mdash ; the aristotelian theory of the soul the influence of this reaction brought forth the two greatest philosophers that the islamic peripatetic school ever produced , namely , ibn bajjah ( avempace ) and ibn rushd ( averroes ) , both of whom undertook the defense of philosophy this poet also took upon himself to free his religion from what he saw as the shackles of speculative philosophy , and to this end wrote the '' kuzari '' , in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike averroes ( averroës ) , the contemporary of maimonides , closed the first great philosophical era of the muslims like all islamic peripatetics , ibn rushd admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation , through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world & mdash ; hypotheses which , in the mind of the arabic philosophers , did away with the dualism involved in aristotle 's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter his ideas on the separation of philosophy and religion , further developed by the averroism school of philosophy , were later influential in the development of modern secularism according to this theory , therefore , the existence of this world is not only a possibility , as ibn sina declared & mdash ; in order to make concessions to the orthodox & mdash ; but also a necessity driven from the islamic schools , islamic philosophy found a refuge with the jews , to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the christian world a series of eminent men & mdash ; such as the ibn tibbons , narboni , gersonides & mdash ; joined in translating the arabic philosophical works into hebrew and commenting upon them the works of ibn rushd especially became the subject of their study , due in great measure to maimonides , who , in a letter addressed to his pupil joseph ben judah , spoke in the highest terms of ibn rushd 's commentary it should be mentioned that this depiction of intellectual tradition in islamic lands is mainly dependent upon what west could understand ( or was willing to understand ) from this long era their main point of dispute is on the influence of different philosophers on islamic philosophy , especially the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as ibn sina and of western thinkers such as ibn rushd for saadia there was no problem as to creation : god created the world ex nihilo , just as the bible attests ; and he contests the theory of the mutakallamin in reference to atoms , which theory , he declares , is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter al-farabi had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries , and was widely considered second only to aristotle in knowledge ( alluded to by his title of '' the second teacher '' ) in his time avicenna had become a central authority on philosophy by then , and several scholars in the 12th century commented on his strong influence at the time : nahyan a avicennism was also influential in medieval europe , particularly his doctrines on the nature of the soul and his existence-essence distinction , along with the debates and censure that they raised in scholasticism while he had very little influence in the islamic world , which was then dominated by avicennian philosophy and ash'ari theology , averroism became very influential in medieval europe , especially among the scholastics for which ibn rushd is considered as the founding father of secular thought in western europe the concept of '' existence precedes essence '' , a key foundational concept of existentialism , can also be found in the works of averroes , as a reaction to avicenna 's concept of '' essence precedes existence '' eschatology relates to one of the six articles of faith ( aqidah ) of islam a significant fraction ( one third , in fact ) of the quran deals with these beliefs , with many hadith elaborating on the themes and details ibn al-nafis dealt with islamic eschatology in some depth in his theologus autodidactus , where he rationality the islamic view of eschatology using reason and science to explain the events that would occur according to islamic eschatology he presented his rational and scientific arguments in the form of arabic fiction , hence his theologus autodidactus may be considered the earliest science fiction work ibn al-nafis described his book theologus autodidactus as a defense of '' the system of islam and the muslims ' doctrines on the missions of prophets , the religious laws , the resurrection of the body , and the transitoriness of the world later islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to the metaphysics claim of avicenna and ibn tufail that bodily resurrection can not be proven through reason , a view that was earlier criticized by al-ghazali amber haque ( 2004 ) , '' psychology from islamic perspective : contributions of early muslim scholars and challenges to contemporary muslim psychologists '' , journal of religion and health 43 ( 4 ) : 357-377 369 it became '' one of the most important books that heralded the scientific revolution '' and age of enlightenment , and the thoughts expressed in the novel can be found in '' different variations and to different degrees in the books of thomas hobbes , john locke , isaac newton , and immanuel kant '' samar attar , the vital roots of european enlightenment : ibn tufayl 's influence on modern western thought , lexington books , early islamic political philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion , and the process of ijtihad to find truth - in effect all philosophy was '' political '' as it had real implications for governance the only greek political treatise known to medieval muslims at the time was plato 's republic by the end of the islamic golden age , however , the asharite view of islam had in general triumphed islamic political philosophy , was , indeed , rooted in the very sources of islam , i.e hence , not only the ideas of the muslim political philosophers but also many other fiqh and ulema posed political ideas and theories for example , the ideas of the khawarij in the very early years of muslim history on khilafa and ummah , or that of shia islam on the concept of imamah are considered proofs of political thought the british philosopher-anthropologist ernest gellner considered ibn khaldun 's definition of government , '' an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself '' , the best in the history of political theory
