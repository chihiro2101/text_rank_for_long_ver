the term '' common-law marriage '' is often used incorrectly to describe various types of couple relationships , such as cohabitation ( whether or not registered ) or other legally formalized relations although these interpersonal relationships are often called '' common-law marriage '' they differ from its original meaning in that they are not legally recognized as '' marriages '' but are a parallel interpersonal status , known as '' domestic partnership '' , '' registered partnership '' , '' conjugal union '' , '' civil union '' , etc in canada , for instance , while couples in '' marriage-like relationships '' may have many of the rights and responsibilities of a marriage ( laws vary by province ) , they are not legally considered married—they may be legally defined as '' unmarried spouses '' and for many purposes ( such as taxes , financial claims , etc first of all , one can only talk of '' common-law marriage '' if such marriage was formed in a jurisdiction which actually applies the common law non-marital relationship contracts are not necessarily recognized from one jurisdiction to another , and neither are de facto couples , whereas common-law marriages , being a legal marriage , are valid marriages worldwide ( if the parties complied with the requirements to form a valid marriage while living in a jurisdiction that allows this form of marriage to be contracted ) common-law and statutory marriage have the following characteristics in common : both parties must freely consent to the marriage both parties must be of legal age to contract a marriage or have parental consent to marry neither party may be under a disability that prevents him or her from entering into a valid marriage – e.g otherwise , common-law marriage differs from statutory marriage as follows : there is no marriage license issued by a government and no marriage certificate filed with a government there is no formal ceremony to solemnize the marriage before witnesses the parties must hold themselves out to the world as spouses ( this is not a requirement of statutory marriage ) most jurisdictions require the parties to be cohabiting at the time the common-law marriage is formed in medieval europe , marriage came under the jurisdiction of canon law , which recognized as a valid marriage one in which the parties stated that they took one another as wife and husband , even in absence of any witnesses the act applied to wales but not to scotland , although property aspects of these relationships are dealt with under state law , the law relating to children of such relationships is contained in the federal family law act 1975 the family law act states that a de facto relationship can exist between two people of different or the same sex and that a person can be in a de facto relationship even if legally married to another person or in a de facto relationship with someone else canada does not currently have the original common-law marriage , although common-law relationships are recognized for certain purposes in canada various federal laws include '' common-law status '' , which automatically takes effect when two people ( of any gender ) have lived together in a conjugal relationship for a minimum period citizenship & immigration canada states that a common-law partner refers to a person who is living in a conjugal relationship with another person ( opposite or same sex ) , and has done so continuously for a period of at least one year common-law partners who are unable to live together or appear in public together because of legal restrictions in their home country or who have been separated for reasons beyond their control ( for example , civil war or armed conflict ) may still qualify and should be included on an application canada revenue agency ( cra ) states , as of 2007 , '' living common-law '' means living with a person in a conjugal relationship without being married and at least one of the following is true : the couple has been living in a marriage relationship for at least 12 continuous months ; the couple are parents of a child by birth or adoption ; or one of the couple has custody and control of the other 's child ( or had custody and control immediately before the child turned 19 years of age ) and the child is wholly dependent on that person for support however , common-law spouses do not have automatic rights under the family law act to their spouses ' property ( section 29 applies only to the support sections of the act ) spouses include married couples as well as those , of same or opposite gender , who satisfy criteria for being in a marriage-like relationship for a time period that depends on the law that is being considered if dispute arises about whether the relationship was marriage-like , a court would consider a comprehensive set of further criteria including the domestic and financial arrangements , degree and nature of intimacy , and the sense of the relationship presented to friends and families ( especially by each spouse to his/her own family ) a spouse is responsible for contributing towards support of a child and possibly the other spouse if he/she is a biological or adoptive parent , or has contributed to support of the child for at least one year during the '' marriage-like relationship '' with the child 's parent and the parent applies to the court for continuing support after separation and within one year of the last support contribution if the '' marriage-like relationship '' has continued for two years , the laws that apply upon separation are the same as those that apply to married couples , according to the '' estate administration act '' those brought into the relationship are subject to any existing valid will , which may be vulnerable to challenge if it does not provide for the surviving spouse and any children social assistance is often immediately reduced when there is perceived to be a '' spouse in the house '' , regardless of the nature of the relationship in alberta , common-law relationships have been subsumed since 2003 under the terms of the adult interdependent relationship act , which may additionally apply to any two unrelated people living together in a mutually dependent relationship for three years the supreme court declared that the following are required to satisfy the conditions for a common-law marriage or a relationship in the nature of marriage : must be of marriageable age only '' a relationship in the nature of marriage '' can afford the rights and protections conferred in the domestics violence act of 2005 and section 125 of the criminal code , which include alimony for the female partner ( unless she leaves her partner for no reason , had an affair with another man , or left with a mutual understanding , in which case alimony amounts must be settled mutually too ) , allowances , shelter and protections for the female partner in case of abuse , right to live in her partner 's house and child custody furthermore , the hindu marriage act stipulates that illegitimate children ( including live-in relationships , a relationship in the nature of marriage and casual relationships ) are treated as equivalent to legitimate children in terms of inheritance in addition courts usually are more likely to recognize such relationship as marriage for granting benefits if the couple could not get married under the israeli law family courts use the male partner or husband ’ s country of nationality ’ s law to deal with family matters and hence if the male partner comes from a country where partnerships or other similar unions are recognised , then a kuwaiti court can also consider it , ( 2005 ) cohabitation , marriage and the law : social change and legal reform in the 21st century ( oxford , hart ) , p.53 that before the marriage act 1753 cohabiting couples would enjoy the protection of a '' common-law marriage '' '' contract marriages '' ( or more strictly marriages per verba de praesenti ) , could be presumed , before the marriage act 1753 , to have been undertaken by mutual consent couples who lived together without undergoing a marriage ceremony this decision affected the subsequent development of english law due to the fact that the marriage act 1753 did not apply overseas the english courts also upheld marriages by consent in territories not under british control but only if it had been impossible for the parties to marry according to the requirements of the local law ) to this limited extent , english law does recognise what has become known as a '' common-law marriage '' by the end of the 1970s a myth had emerged that marrying made little difference to one ’ s legal rights , and this may have fuelled the subsequent increase in the number of couples living together and having children together outside marriage under scots law , there have been several forms of '' irregular marriage '' , among them : irregular marriage by declaration de praesenti – declaring in the presence of two witnesses that one takes someone as one 's wife or husband in 2006 , '' marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute '' , the last form of irregular marriage that could still be contracted in scotland , was abolished in the family law ( scotland ) act 2006 once they meet the requirements of common-law marriage , couples in those true

marriage or their eventual heirs may have difficulty proving their relationship to be marriage however , in the caribbean , the term '' common-law '' marriage is also widely described , by custom as much as by law , to any long term relationship between male and female partners
