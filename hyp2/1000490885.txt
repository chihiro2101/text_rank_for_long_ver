even in the details of daily life , i need to feel above '' beside the atmosphere ( which could be established almost anywhere else ) the city also was chosen by camus for a more peculiar reason the novel opens with clamence sitting in the bar mexico city casually talking to a stranger — the reader , some would say — about the proper way to order a drink ; for here , despite the cosmopolitan nature of amsterdam , the bartender refuses to respond to anything other than dutch clamence tells us that he used to lead an essentially perfect life in paris as a highly successful and well-respected defence lawyer he hesitates for a moment , thinking the sight strange at such an hour and given the barrenness of the streets , but continues on his way nevertheless clamence stops walking , knowing exactly what has happened , but does nothing — in fact , he does n't even turn around several years after the apparent suicide of the woman off the pont royal — and an evidently successful effort to purge the entire event from his memory — clamence is on his way home one autumn evening after a particularly pleasing day of work nevertheless , he tells us that '' i could still hear it distinctly behind me , coming from nowhere unless from the water other cars behind him start honking their horns , and clamence politely asks the man several times if he would please move his motorcycle off the road so that others can drive around him ; however , with each repetition of the request , the motorcyclist becomes increasingly agitated and threatens clamence with physical violence the feeling of resentment gnaws away at him , and clamence explains that clamence thus arrives at the conclusion that his whole life has in fact been lived in search of honour , recognition , and power over others he reflects , for example , that whenever he had helped a blind man across the street — something he especially enjoyed doing — he would doff his hat to the man since the blind man obviously can not see this acknowledgement , clamence asks , '' to whom was it addressed ? to the public this realization precipitates an emotional and intellectual crisis for clamence which , moreover , he is unable to avoid , having now discovered it ; the sound of laughter that first struck him on the pont des arts slowly begins to permeate his entire existence '' in fact , clamence even goes so far as to consider to clamence 's frustration and dismay , however , his efforts in this regard are ineffective , generally because many of the people around him refuse to take him seriously ; they find it inconceivable that a man of his reputation could ever say such things and not be joking he closes his law practice , avoids his former colleagues in particular and people in general , and throws himself completely into uncompromising debauchery ; while humankind may be grossly hypocritical in the areas from which he has withdrawn , '' no man is a hypocrite in his pleasures '' ( camus 311 – a quotation from samuel johnson ) the last of clamence 's monologues takes place in his apartment in the ( former ) jewish quarter , and recounts more specifically the events which shaped his current outlook ; in this regard his experiences during the second world war are crucial these experiences subsequently caused the man to lose his faith in the catholic church ( and perhaps in god as well ) ; as a form of protest du guesclin announces the need for a new pope — one who will '' agree to keep alive , in himself and in others , the community of our sufferings '' — to be chosen from among the prisoners in the camp ) however , clamence eventually informs the bartender that the painting is in fact stolen , that police from several countries are searching for it , and offers to keep it for him ; the bartender immediately agrees to the proposal the novel ends on a sinister note : '' pronounce to yourself the words that years later have n't ceased to resound through my nights , and which i will speak at last through your mouth : '' o young girl , throw yourself again into the water so that i might have a second time the chance to save the two of us ! '' a second time , eh , what imprudence ! suppose , dear sir , someone actually took our word for it ? it would have to be fulfilled
