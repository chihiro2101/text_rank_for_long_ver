they seem to prefer desolate , lightly-populated areas where predators who provide many bones , such as wolves and golden eagles , have healthy populations although they occasionally descend to , bearded vultures are rare below an elevation of and normally reside above in some parts of their range they are typically found around or above the tree line which are often near the tops of the mountains , at up to in europe , in africa and in central asia during 1970s and 1980s the population of the bearded vulture in southern africa declined however their distribution remained constant adult bearded vultures utilise areas with higher altitudes , with steep slopes and sharp points and within areas that are situated closer to their nesting sites abundance of bearded vultures is shown for eight regions within the species ' range in southern africa the total population of bearded vultures in southern africa is calculated as being 408 adult birds and 224 young birds of all age classes therefore giving an estimate of about 632 birds this species is relatively small headed , although its neck is powerful and thick a skeleton left on a mountain will dehydrate and become protected from bacterial degradation , and the bearded vulture can return to consume the remainder of a carcass even months after the soft parts have been consumed by other animals , larvae and bacteria bearded vultures avoid remains of larger species ( such as cows and horses ) probably because of the variable cost/benefit ratios in handling efficiency , ingestion process and transportation of the remains less frequently , these birds have been observed trying to break bones ( usually of a medium size ) by hammering them with their bill directly into rocks while perched these animals have been killed by being surprised by the large birds and battered with wings until they fall off precipitous rocky edges to their deaths ; although in some cases these may be accidental killings when both the vulture and the mammal surprise each other occasionally smaller ground-dwelling birds , such as partridges and pigeons , have been reported eaten , possibly either as fresh carrion ( which is usually ignored by these birds ) or killed with beating wings by the vulture while foraging for bones or live prey while in flight , bearded vultures fly fairly low over the rocky ground , staying around high although generally solitary , the bond between a breeding pair is often considerably close the large birds also regularly lock feet with each other and fall some distance through the sky with each other the nest is a massive pile of sticks , that goes from around across and deep when first constructed up to across and deep , with a covering of various animal matter from food , after repeated uses wild bearded vultures have a mean lifespan of 21.4 years , but have been observed to live for up to at least 45 years in captivity the bearded vulture had a very poor reputation in early modern europe , due in large part to tales of the birds stealing babies and livestock the growing availability of firearms , combined with bounties offered for dead vultures , caused a sharp decline in the bearded vulture population around the alps a second attempt was made in 1987 , using a technique called '' hacking , '' by which young individuals ( from 90 to 100 days ) from zoological parks would be taken from the nest and placed in a protected area in the alps the bearded vulture is one of the most endangered european bird species as over the last century its abundance and breeding range have drastically declined it naturally occurs at low densities , with anywhere from a dozen to 500 pairs now being found in each mountain range in eurasia where the species breeds relatively large , healthy numbers seem to occur in some parts of the himalayas as well the declines of the bearded vulture populations have been documented throughout their range resulting from a decrease in habitat space , fatal collisions with energy infrastructure , reduced food availability , poisons left out for carnivores and direct persecution in the form of trophy hunting this species is currently listed as near threatened by the iucn red list last accessed on 1 october 2016 , the population continues to decline as the distribution ranges of this species continues to decline due to human development the ancient greeks used ornithomancys to guide their political decisions : bearded vultures , or ossifragae were one of the few species of birds that could yield valid signs to these soothsayers video of lammergeier shattering bones into smaller pieces on which it then feeds at arkive species text in the atlas of southern african birds facts and characteristics : bearded vulture at vulture territory the lammergeier in spain cine and photo work about the bearded vulture in the alps diet information bone-eating vulture and a snow wolf
