calonice as indeed we are ! these lines , spoken by the athenian lysistrata and her friend calonice at the beginning of the play , lysistrata in aristophanis comoediae tomus ii , ed geldart ( oxford university press , 1907 ) , lines 10–11 , wikisource original greek set the scene for the action that follows soon after the oath is finished , a cry of triumph is heard from the nearby acropolis—the old women of athens have seized control of it at lysistrata 's instigation , since it holds the state treasury , without which the men can not long continue to fund their war when the magistrate points out that men also age , she reminds him that men can marry at any age whereas a woman has only a short time before she is considered too old the debate or agon is continued between the chorus of old men and the chorus of old women until lysistrata returns to the stage with some news—her comrades are desperate for sex and they are beginning to desert on the silliest pretexts ( for example , one woman says she has to go home to air her fabrics by spreading them on the bed ) all sing a merry song in praise of athene , goddess of wisdom and chastity , whose citadel provided a refuge for the women during the events of the comedy , and whose implied blessing has brought about a happy ending to the play old comedy was a highly topical genre and the playwright expected his audience to be familiar with local identities and issues the following list of identities mentioned in the play gives some indication of the difficulty faced by any producer trying to stage lysistrata for modern audiences s : el : λυσιστράτη line 1094 hippias : an athenian tyrant , he receives two mentions in the play , as a sample of the kind of tyranny that the old men can '' smell '' in the revolt by the women lysistrata line 619 and secondly in connection with a good service that the spartans once rendered athens ( they removed him from power by force ) s : el : λυσιστράτη line 1153 aristogeiton : a famous tyrannicide , he is mentioned briefly here with approval by the old men s : el : λυσιστράτη lines 391-93 cleisthenes : a notoriously effete homosexual and the butt of many jokes in old comedy , he receives two mentions here , firstly as a suspected mediator between the spartans and the athenian women s : el : λυσιστράτη line 621 and secondly as someone that sex-starved athenian men are beginning to consider a viable proposition birds lines 822 , 1127 , 1295 lycon : a minor politician who afterwards figured significantly in the trial of socrates , s : apology ( plato ) 29 section 29 he is mentioned here merely as the husband of a woman that the old men have a particular dislike for s : el : λυσιστράτη line 270 ( he is mentioned also in the wasps ) homer : the epic poet is quoted in a circuitous manner when lysistrata quotes her husband s : el : λυσιστράτη line 520 who quotes from a speech by hector in the iliad as he farewells his wife before going to battle : '' war will be men 's business '' iliad book 6 , line 492 aeschylus : the tragic poet is mentioned briefly s : el : λυσιστράτη line 188 as the source of a ferocious oath that lysistrata proposes to her comrades , in which a shield is to be filled with blood ; the oath is found in aeschylus ' seven against thebes seven against thebes lines 42–48 euripides : the dramatic poet receives two brief mentions here , in each case by the old men with approval as a misogynist 250 he is mentioned here briefly by the old men in reference to their own desire to assault rebellious women timon : the legendary misanthrope , he is mentioned here with approval by the old women in response to the old men 's favourable mention of melanion , a legendary misogynist s : el : λυσιστράτη lines 785–820 orsilochus and pellene : an athenian pimp and a prostitute , a 215 in fact the play might not even be a plea for an end to the war so much as an imaginative vision of an honorable end to the war at a time when no such ending was possible such variations from convention include : the divided chorus : the chorus begins this play being divided ( old men versus old women ) , and its unification later exemplifies the major theme of the play : reconciliation there is nothing quite like this use of a chorus in the other plays most plays have a second parabasis near the end and there is something like a parabasis in that position in this play but it comprises only two songs ( strophe and antistrophe ) and these are separated by an episodic scene of dialogue lysistrata wikisource original greek lines 1043–71 and 1189–1215 in these two songs , the now united chorus declares that it is not prepared to speak ill of anyone on this occasion because the current situation ( ta parakeímena ) is already bad enough—topical reference to the catastrophic end to the sicilian expedition in keeping however with the victim-centered approach of old comedy , the chorus then teases the entire audience with false generosity , offering gifts that are not in its power to give like most agons , however , it is structured symmetrically in two sections , each half comprising long verses of anapests that are introduced by a choral song and that end in a pnigos in the first half of the agon , lysistrata quotes from homer 's iliad ( '' war will be men 's business '' ) , then quotes 'the man in the street ' ( '' is n't there a man in the country ? '' — '' no , by god , there is n't ! '' ) and finally arrives at the only logical conclusion to these premises : '' war will be women 's business ! '' the logic of this conclusion is supported rhythmically by the pnigos , during which lysistrata and her friends dress the magistrate like a woman , with a veil and a basket of wool , reinforcing her argument and lending it ironic point—if the men are women , obviously the war can only be women 's business during the pnigos of the second section , the magistrate is dressed like a corpse , highlighting the argument that war is a living death for women 1961 : the play served as the basis for the musical the happiest girl in the world 1972 : the '' edwina '' episode of m a s h uses the device of a sexual strike by the nurses , to get one man to date the unusually clumsy edwina ; the nurses ' organized withholding of sexuality was somewhat reminiscent of lysistrata , though the play is not explicitly referenced 2003 : '' a miami tail '' - american urban movie version 2004 : a 100-person show called lysistrata 100 was performed in brooklyn , new york the play was set at the dionysia , much as the original may have been 2011 : meg wolitzer adapted the story to 21st-century new jersey in '' the uncoupling , '' in which a production of lysistrata causes women to turn away from men 2015 : american filmmaker spike lee 's film chi-raq transposes the events of the play into modern-day inner-city chicago , substituting gun violence among african-americans for the peloponnesian war and rhyming rap dialog for the more formal greek poetry 2016 : animator richard williams 's oscar-nominated short film , prologue , is '' the first part of a feature film loosely based on aristophanes ’ anti-war play lysisrata '' 2016 : writer-director matt cooper 's film comedy is that a gun in your pocket ? is about a texas town whose women go on a sex strike to make their menfolk abandon their love of guns sex strike list of films based on military books ( pre-1775 ) codex ravennas 429
