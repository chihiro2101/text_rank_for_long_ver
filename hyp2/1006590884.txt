radial engines were rare in european designs as they were considered to have too large a frontal area for good streamlining and would not be suitable for high speed aircraft the main concern was providing cooling air over the cylinder heads , which generally required a very large opening at the front of the aircraft although the problems appeared to be fixable , since the engine was already fairly dated in terms of design , in 1938 bmw proposed an entirely new engine designed specifically for fan-cooling that could be brought to production quickly the supercharger was rather basic in the early models , using a single-stage two-speed design directly geared to the engine ( unlike the db 601 's hydraulically clutched version ) which led to rather limited altitude performance , in keeping with its intended medium-altitude usage the kommandogerät could be considered to be a precursor to the engine control units used for many vehicles ' internal combustion engines of the late 20th and early 21st centuries there was a considerable amount of wind tunnel work done on the engine and bmw-designed forward cowling ( incorporating the engine 's oil cooler ) at the luftfahrtforschungsanstalt ( lfa ) facility in völkenrode , leading to the conclusion it was possible to reduce drag equivalent to the a and b models were intended to be used in pairs on twin-engine designs , cancelling out net torque and making the plane easier to handle the bmw 801c was developed for use in single- or multi-engined fighters and included a new hydraulic prop control and various changes intended to improve cooling , including cooling '' gills '' on the cowling behind the engine in place of the original slots as with the 801b engine design , however , the 801h-2 engine did not leave the prototype stage with the engine being used in higher-altitude fighter roles , a number of attempts were made to address the limited performance of the original supercharger the e model was also used as the basis for the bmw 801r , which included a much more complex and powerful two-stage four-speed supercharger , as well as die cast hydronalium cylinder heads , strengthened crankshaft and pistons , and chromed cylinders and exhaust valves ; it was anticipated this version would produce over , or over with mw 50 methanol-water injection instead , continued improvements to the basic e model led to the bmw 801f , which dramatically improved performance across the board , with takeoff power increasing to 2,400 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,790 & nbsp ; kw ) , making the 801 the only german aviation engine of an existing type that had a producible subtype that could luftwaffe engine development to be developed from an already combat-reliable , well-proven military aircraft powerplant not long after v-e day , the investigations of the fedden mission into german aircraft engine development during the war years would reveal that the bmw firm had needed to undertake different levels of development priority for not only the fourteen-cylinder production 801 radial , but also the eighteen-cylinder bmw 802 ( with a displacement figure close to that of the wright r-3350 ) and liquid-cooled , wasp major-class ( though larger , at an 83.5 litre displacement ) bmw 803 radial engines bruno bruckmann , head of bmw 's piston and jet engine development departments , and learned that the priorities for the trio of aforementioned bmw radial engines was : firstly , the 801 was to be developed '' up to its limits '' , with the 802 's design completion and prototype construction as a secondary issue , with the complex 803 four-row radial only receiving attention to its design-development by contrast , the two closest allied equivalents to the 801 in configuration and displacement – the american wright twin cyclone , and the soviet shvetsov ash-82 radials – never had any need to be developed beyond a 1,500 & nbsp ; kw output level as the 801 needed to be ; as larger-displacement , 18-cylinder radial aviation engines in both allied nations ( the american 46 litre double wasp and aforementioned , nearly 55 litre duplex-cyclone ) and the eventual 1945 premiere of the soviet 58 litre shvetsov ash-73 design , all three of which started their development before 1940 , handled needs for even greater power from larger-displacement allied radial aviation engines the bmw 801e was likewise modified to create the bmw 801q , delivering a superb 1,715 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,261 & nbsp ; kw ) at , power ratings no existing allied radial engine of a similar displacement could match 801j engine photo at flightglobal ( accessed march 11 , 2016 ) not many of these engines ever entered production due to high costs , and the various high-altitude designs based on them were forced to turn to other engines , typically the junkers jumo 213 this provided effective cooling although at the cost of about 70 ps ( 69 & nbsp ; hp , 51.5 & nbsp ; kw ) required to drive the fan when the aircraft was at low speed the design evolved throughout the war , including an extension to the engine mounts that allowed for larger cooling gills this factory-supplied cowling also improved the simplicity of engine replacement in the field in more completely '' unitizing '' a bmw 801 radial engine , with as many of its auxiliary systems as possible being simultaneously replaceable with the engine itself , as opposed to opening or removing a '' separate '' cowling attached to the fuselage of the aircraft the more comprehensive triebwerksanlage format for unitization consolidated more of the engine 's required accessory systems beyond what the earlier motoranlage concept could , plus some external mountings , such as an integrally complete exhaust system ( including a turbocharger , if fitted as part of the design ) , as a completely interchangeable unit
