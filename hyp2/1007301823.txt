an alternative approach , that may overcome these challenges , is to define microstates as '' modern protected states '' however , professor of international law maurice mendelson disputes qualifying vatican city as a state , arguing that it does not meet the '' traditional criteria of statehood '' and that the '' special status of the vatican city is probably best regarded as a means of ensuring that the pope can freely exercise his spiritual functions , and in this respect is loosely analogous to that of the headquarters of international organisations statistical research has shown that microstates are more likely to be democracy than larger states this shows that countries with small populations often had a high degree of political freedom and civil liberties , which is one of the hallmarks of democracies some scholars have taken the statistical correlation between small size and democracy as a sign that smallness is beneficial to the development of a democratic political system , anckar , d due to small populations , family and personal relations are often decisive in microstate politics the high number of democracies amongst microstates could be explained by their colonial history because of the high number of microstates that were british colonies in the past , microstates often have a majoritarian and parliamentary political system similar to the westminster system some microstates with a history as british colony have implemented some aspects of a consensus political system , to adapt to their geographic features or societal make-up while the colonial history often determines what political systems microstates have , they do implement changes to better accommodate their specific characteristics this had led some researchers to believe that microstates are forced to subordinate themselves to larger states which reduces their sovereignty examples of this are microstates that establish a tax haven or sell their support in international committees in exchange for military and economic support a small number of tiny sovereign political units are founded on historical anomalies or eccentric interpretations of law these types of states , often labelled as '' microstates , '' are usually located on small ( usually disputed ) territorial enclaves , generate limited economic activity founded on tourism and philatelic and numismatic sales , and are tolerated or ignored by the nations from which they claim to have seceded
