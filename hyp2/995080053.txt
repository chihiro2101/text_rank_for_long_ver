the first known idea to build a canal between the river mersey and the river trent was put forward in 1755 , though no action was taken at that time james brindley , the engineer behind many of the canals in england , did his first canal work on the trent and mersey , though his first job in charge of construction was on the bridgewater canal the owners of the river weaver navigation were also not happy about the proposals , because the route would almost parallel that of the river john gilbert 's plan for the '' grand trunk '' canal met opposition at the eastern end where , in burton on trent , the locals objected to the canal passing parallel to the upper trent navigation '' six years before the complete opening of the trent and mersey canal in 1771 , wedgwood built the factory village of etruria on the outskirts of stoke-on-trent , close to the canal by this time , much of the canal had been built towards preston brook up until 1777 , pots had to be carried on the short journey from etruria , over the top of kidsgrove hill , and to the other side , where the canal had been constructed to preston brook the grand trunk was a part of a larger scheme of james brindley 's to link the four main rivers of england ( trent , mersey , severn and thames ) in a project known as the '' grand cross '' the hall green branch leaves the t & m mainline ( which runs eastâ€“west here ) on the south side , but then crosses over the main line and travels a short distance north to join the macclesfield canal at hall green stop lock ( some guides do not refer to the hall green branch , simply treating it as part of the macclesfield canal ) at the red bull settlement , the branch turns 90 degrees right , to head north and cross the main line on poole lock aqueduct the northern end of the canal makes an end-on junction with the bridgewater canal within preston brook tunnel , from which one can access runcorn ( but no longer the mersey or ship canal ) in one direction and manchester ( with its many canal links ) in the other direction from the junction with the bridgewater canal , the t & m travels south through preston brook tunnel ( one-way operation , alternating each half-hour ) and two smaller tunnels at saltersford ( since 2008 also one-way operation , alternating each half-hour ) , and barnton to the '' junction '' with the river weaver at anderton boat lift near northwich after the harecastle tunnel ( one way , alternating roughly every two hours ) , the canal emerges in the outskirts of stoke-on-trent , and is soon in the middle of the city and then at etruria , and the junction with the caldon canal the canal now heads directly to its terminus , passing through burton upon trent , mercia marina at findern , the largest inland waterway marina in the united kingdom , and then through wide locks ( the first being at stenson ) to shardlow and finally derwent mouth it is not far from derwent mouth , via the river trent , to trentlock , the four-way junction with the erewash canal ( dead end at great northern basin , formerly a link with the cromford canal ) , cranfleet cut ( bypassing thrumpton weir to continue navigation towards nottingham ) and the river soar navigation ( linking via leicester to the grand union canal ) canals of the united kingdom history of the british canal system four counties ring , a canal cruising ring that includes part of the trent and mersey
