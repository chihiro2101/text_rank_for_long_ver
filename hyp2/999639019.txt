many claim this development as the end of the format war between memory stick and sd card sony 's first significant migration away from memory stick did not come until 2019 , when it introduced the Î±7r iv full-frame mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera without memory stick support , opting instead for dual sdxc slots memory stick cards were almost entirely produced by sony itself in response to the storage limitations of the original memory stick , sony introduced the memory stick select at ces 2003 on january 9 most devices that use the original memory sticks support both the original and pro sticks since both formats have identical form factors memory stick duos are available with the same features as the larger standard memory stick , available with and without high speed mode , and with and without magicgate support a simple adapter allows memory stick duo to be used in devices designed to accept the original memory stick form factor the memory stick pro duo ( mspd ) quickly replaced the memory stick duo due to the duo 's size limitation of 128 & nbsp ; mb and slow transfer speed memory stick pro duos are available in all the same variants as the larger memory stick pro , with and without high speed mode , and with and without magicgate support in 2009 , sony and sandisk also announced the joint development of an expanded memory stick pro format tentatively named '' memory stick pro format for extended high capacity '' in this article the unit symbol 'tb ' is used to mean 1000^4 bytes ( 1 terabyte ) the m2 comes with an adapter , much like the duo sticks , to ensure physical compatibility with memory stick pro devices however , not all devices with a pro slot are compatible with the m2/adapter combination , as the firmware of older devices do n't support the higher capacity of some m2 cards on january 7 , 2009 , sandisk and sony announced the memory stick xc format ( tentatively named '' memory stick format series for extended high capacity '' at the time ) in line with the rest of the industry , the xc series uses the newer exfat file system due to size and formatting limitations of fat/fat16/fat32 filesystems used in the pro series no memory stick xc cards were released to the market , likely due to domination of sd cards ; its equivalent here is named sdxc and eventually became more successful than any other exfat-based memory card format the mark 2 designation indicates the memory stick is suitable for use with avchd recording products or other faster memory stick enabled devices by providing appropriate minimum write performance .
