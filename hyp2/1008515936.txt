'' their shape allowed for garlands to be hung from them and were first seen , at least in the british isles , between ad 1350 and 1400 within the context of medieval christian european culture phallic symbolism has been attributed to the maypole in the later early modern period , as one sexual reference is in john cleland 's controversial novel fanny hill : ronald hutton has stated , however , that '' there is no historical basis for his claim , and no sign that the people who used maypoles thought that they were phallic '' and that '' they were not carved to appear so in this way , they bore similarities with the may day garlands which were also a common festival practice in britain and ireland while the maypole is traditionally set up with the help of long poles , today it may sometime also be done using tractors , forklifts or even cranes during the month of may , many house front gardens have such maypoles depending on local custom , the maibaum may remain in place all year round or may be taken down at the end of may the traditions surrounding the maypoles vary locally , as does the design of the poles , although the design featuring a cross and two rings is most common nowadays a perhaps more original incarnation is the one still in use in the swedish landscape of sm√•land where the pole carries a large horizontally suspended ring around it , hanging from ropes attached at the top of the pole yet another pointer in this direction is the custom that young maidens expect to dream of their future mate if they pick seven different flowers and place them under their pillow when they go to bed on this day only literary evidence for maypole use across much of britain increases in later decades , and '' by the period 1350-1400 the custom was well established across southern britain , in town and country and in both welsh-speaking and english-speaking areas in some cases the wood for the pole was obtained illegally , for instance in 1603 , the earl of huntingdon was angered when trees were removed from his estates for use as maypoles without his permission in scotland meanwhile , which at this time was still an independent state , protestantism , in the form of presbyterianism , had taken a more powerful hold , and largely wiped out the practice of maypoles across the country '' the only recorded breach of the long parliament 's prohibition was in 1655 in henley-in-arden , where local officials stopped the erection of maypoles for traditional games however , they are certain that the prohibition turned maypole dancing into a symbol of resistance to the long parliament and to the republic that followed it the church of st andrew undershaft in the city of london is named after the maypole that was kept under its eaves and set up each spring until 1517 when student riots put an end to the custom when the restoration occurred in 1660 , common people in london , in particular , put up maypoles '' at every crossway , '' according to john aubrey however , the maypole remained an anti-religious symbol to some theologians , as shown by '' the two babylons '' , an anti-catholic conspiracist pamphlet that first appeared in 1853 as revived , the dance is performed by pairs of boys and girls ( or men and women ) who stand alternately around the base of the pole , each holding the end of a ribbon temporary maypoles are usually erected on village greens and events are often supervised by local morris dance groups children would take these hand-held poles to school on may day morning and prizes may be awarded for the most impressive it still occurs from place to place but is invariably a reinstatement of a local custom that had lapsed decades earlier for dressing a maypole , one of the last recorded examples of the rural festival of the first of may in scotland , having been put down by act of parliament immediately after the reformation in 1560 the earliest use of the maypole in america occurred in 1628 , where william bradford , governor of new plymouth , wrote of an incident where a number of servants , together with the aid of an agent , broke free from their indentured servant to create their own colony , setting up a maypole in the center of the settlement , and behaving in such a way as to receive the scorn and disapproval of the nearby colonies , as well as an officer of the king , bearing patent for the state of massachusetts they changed also the name of their place , and instead of calling it mounte wollaston , they call it merie-mounte , as if this joylity would have lasted ever john endecott , who brought a patent under the broad seall , for the governmente of the massachusetts , who visiting those parts caused the may-polle to be cutt downe , and rebuked them for their profannes , and admonished them to looke ther should be better walking ; so they now , or others , changed the name of their place againe , and called it mounte-dagon in new westminster , british columbia , dancing around the may pole and may day celebrations have been held for 149 years in frozen , a group of people can be seen raising a maypole as the camera tracks through arendelle prior to elsa 's coronation
