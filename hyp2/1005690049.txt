during the anglo-nepalese war ( 1814–1816 ) between the gorkha kingdom ( present-day federal democratic republic of nepal ) and the east india company , the gorkhali soldiers impressed the british , who called them gurkhas . british east india company army these groups , eventually lumped together under the term gurkha , became the backbone of british indian forces gurkhas served as troops under contract to the british east india company in the pindaree war of 1817 , in bharatpur in 1826 , and the first and second anglo-sikh wars in 1846 and 1848 during the indian rebellion of 1857 , gurkhas fought on the british side and became part of the british indian army on its formation the 2nd gurkha rifles made a notable contribution during the conflict , and 25 indian order of merit awards were made to men from that regiment during the siege of delhi during world war i ( 1914–1918 ) more than 200,000 gurkhas served in the british army , suffering approximately 20,000 casualties and receiving almost 2,000 gallantry awards the number of gurkha battalions was increased to 33 , and gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the british high command by the gurkha government for service on all fronts during the battle of loos ( june–december 1915 ) a battalion of the 8th gurkhas fought to the last man , hurling themselves time after time against the weight of the german defences , and in the words of the indian corps commander , lt the 1st/6th gurkhas , having landed at cape helles , led the assault during the first major operation to take a turkish high point , and in doing so captured a feature that later became known as '' gurkha bluff '' during world war ii ( 1939–1945 ) there were ten gurkha regiments , with two battalions each , making a total of 20 pre-war battalions . gurkha military rank system in the british indian army gurkha ranks in the british indian army followed the same pattern as those used throughout the rest of the indian army at that time after indian independence in 1947 , gurkha officers in regiments which became part of the british army received the king 's ( later queen 's ) gurkha commission , and were known as king's/queen 's gurkha officers ( kgo/qgo ) jemadars and subedars normally served as platoon commanders and company 2ics but were junior to all british officers , while the subedar major was the commanding officer 's advisor on the men and their welfare the equivalent ranks in the post-1947 indian army were ( and are ) known as junior commissioned officers ( jcos ) it was customary for a gurkha soldier to rise through the ranks and prove his ability before his regiment would consider offering him a commission from the 1920s gurkhas could also receive king 's indian commissions , and later full king 's or queen 's commissions , which put them on a par with british officers after 1948 , the brigade of gurkhas ( part of the british army ) was formed and adopted standard british army rank structure and nomenclature , except for the three viceroy commission ranks between warrant officer 1 and second lieutenant ( jemadar , subedar and subedar major ) which remained , albeit with different rank titles lieutenant ( queens gurkha officer ) , captain ( qgo ) and major ( qgo ) the qgo commission was abolished in 2007 ; gurkha soldiers are currently commissioned as late entry officers ( as above ) after indian independence , and the partition of india , in 1947 and under the tripartite agreement , the original ten gurkha regiments consisting of the 20 pre-war battalions were split between the british army and the newly independent indian army to the disappointment of their british officers , the majority of gurkhas given a choice between british or indian army service opted for the latter the reason appears to have been the pragmatic one that the gurkha regiments of the indian army would continue to serve in their existing roles in familiar territory and under terms and conditions that were well established by contrast , the four regiments selected for british service faced an uncertain future , initially in malaya ; a region where relatively few gurkhas had previously served the four regiments ( or eight battalions ) in british service have since been reduced to a single ( two-battalion ) regiment , while the indian units have been expanded beyond their pre-independence establishment of 12 battalions the principal aim of the tripartite agreement was to ensure that gurkhas serving under the crown would be paid on the same scale as those serving in the new indian army with the abolition of the nepalese monarchy in 2008 , the future recruitment of gurkhas for british and indian service was initially put into doubt gurkhas were among the troops who retook the falklands in 1982 and have served a number of tours of duty in the current war in afghanistan upon independence in 1947 , six of the original ten gurkha regiments remained with the indian army since partition , the gurkha regiments that were transferred to the indian army have established themselves as a permanent and vital part of the newly independent indian army the gurkha contingent ( gc ) of the singapore police force was formed on 9 april 1949 from selected ex-british army gurkhas it is an integral part of the police force and was raised to replace a sikh unit that had existed prior to the japanese occupation during the second world war the majority are veterans of the british army and the singaporean police , who have joined the gru as a second career in addition , gurkhas would , for the first time , be able to transfer to another army unit after five years ' service and women would also be allowed to join , although not in first-line units , conforming to the british army 's policy
