apart from the distinction in sizes mentioned above , two main categories of amphibious vehicles are immediately apparent : those that travel on an air-cushion ( hovercraft ) and those that do not this explains why many designs use tracks in addition to or instead of wheels , and in some cases even resort to articulated body configurations or other unconventional designs such as screw-propelled vehicles which use auger-like barrels which propel a vehicle through muddy terrain with a twisting motion most land vehicles – even lightly armoured ones – can be made amphibious simply by providing them with a waterproof hull and perhaps a propeller for propulsion in or on the water some vehicles simply make do by spinning their wheels or tracks , while others can power their way forward more effectively using ( additional ) screw propeller ( s ) or pump-jet most amphibians will work only as a displacement hull when in the water – only a small number of designs have the capability to raise out of the water when speed is gained , to achieve high velocity hydroplaning , skimming over the water surface like motorboat until the late 1920s , the efforts to unify a boat and an automobile mostly came down to simply putting wheels and axles on a boat hull , or getting a rolling chassis to float by blending a boat-like hull with the car 's frame the single front wheel provided direction , both on land and in the water remarkably the boat-like hull was one of the first integral bodies ever used on a car in some of them , the amphibious capabilities are central to their purpose , whereas in others they are only an expansion to what has remained primarily a watercraft or a land vehicle the design that came together with all the features needed for a practical all-terrain amphibious vehicle was by peter prell of new jersey his design , unlike others , could operate not only on rivers and lakes but the sea and did not require firm ground to enter or exit the water recently , gibbs amphibians has developed a new type of amphibian , one capable of high speeds on both land and water typically an amphibious atv ( aatv ) is a small , lightweight , off-highway vehicle , constructed from an integral hard plastic or fibreglass bodytub , fitted with six ( sometimes eight ) driven wheels , with low pressure , balloon tires most contemporary designs use garden tractor type engines , that will provide roughly 25 & nbsp ; mph ( 40 & nbsp ; km/h ) top speed on land on land these units have high grip and great off-road ability , that can be further enhanced with an optional set of tracks that can be mounted directly onto the wheels although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the water – albeit slowly – outboard motors can be added for extended water use in october 2013 , gibbs amphibians introduced the long-awaited quadski , the first amphibious vehicle capable of traveling 45 & nbsp ; mph on land or water with almost 4,000 pieces built , the amphicar is still the most successfully produced civilian amphibious car to date some amphibious vehicles , rather than being designed for land transport with the ability to cross water , are designed as water-transport vehicles with the ability to travel on land the distinction is that the vehicles are designed to be high performing on water , with the land transport ability added to give additional functionality , rather than being the main function sealegs amphibious craft are an example of this , which are a range of aluminium fabricated boats ( mostly ribs ) designed and manufactured in auckland , new zealand the latter was based on a 1950s civil construction vehicle and became the us army 's standard heavy tactical truck before its replacement by the hemtt although the vehicles ' wheels were mounted without suspension or steering action , and land speeds over 20 & nbsp ; mph ( 32 & nbsp ; km/h ) were ill-advised , its articulated design provided it with good maneuverability and helped it to keep all four wheels firmly in touch with uneven ground for taking vehicles and supplies onto the beaches the us used the 1950s designed larc-v and the huge larc-lx which could carry 60 tons of cargo the vab is a french fully amphibious apc , powered in the water by two water jets , mounted one on either side of the rear hull ( see detail picture above ) most of the vehicles the soviets designed were amphibious or could ford deep water the united states started developing a long line of lvt ( landing vehicle tracked ) designs from around 1940 to provide motive power , they use their tracks , sometimes with an added propeller or water jets at the end of world war i a mark ix tank had drums attached to the side and front and was tested as an amphibious vehicle launched into hendon reservoir the crusader was trialled with two pontoons that could be attached or removed , the tracks driving the tank in the water the valentine , then the m4 sherman medium tank were made amphibious with the addition of a rubberized canvas screen to provide additional buoyancy and propellers driven by the main engine to give propulsion a number swamped and sank in the operation , due to rough weather in the english channel ( with some tanks having been launched too far out ) , and to turning in the current to converge on a specific point on the battlefield , which allowed waves to breach over the screens the sheridan could still cross a body of water , but like its swimming cousin , the m113 armored personnel carrier , also built of aluminium ) the river had to be narrow , less than during the cold war , the swedish stridsvagn 103 main battle tank carried flotation gear all the time and was , therefore , theoretically , always amphibious usually , the front unit houses at least the engine , gearboxes , fuel tank ( s ) and the driver 's compartment , and perhaps there is some space left for cargo or passengers , whereas the rear unit is the primary load carrier in world war ii the tanks following the sherman dds were given waterproofed hulls and trunking was fixed to the engine intakes and exhausts to allow them to come ashore from landing craft in shallow water one example is the sea tractor , a motor vehicle that can travel through shallow water , with driver and passengers on a raised platform one of the benefits of this type of amphibious craft is the possibility of making them large—the british-built sr.n4 mk.3 ferries could carry dozens of vehicles the hovercraft 's ability to distribute its laden weight evenly across the surface below it makes it well suited to the role of amphibious landing craft the us navy lcac can take troops and materials ( if necessary an m1 abrams tank ) from ship to shore and can access more than 70 % of the world 's coastline , as opposed to conventional landing craft , which are only capable of landing along 17 % of that coastline in s08e03 , clarkson , hammond and may competed to see who could build the best amphibious car , starting with a used vehicle of their choice in the initial tests , the vw had issues on both water and land , the jeep worked well on water but not on land ( the airboat motor left him stranded on the highway ) , and the turboat performed well on land but sank immediately in the water
