the earliest radio stations were radiotelegraphy systems and did not carry audio by about 1920 , valve technology had matured to the point where radio broadcasting was quickly becoming viable charles herrold started broadcasting in california in 1909 and was carrying audio by the next year the commercial broadcasting designation came from the type of broadcast license ; advertisings did not air until years later the montreal station that became cfcf began broadcast programming on may 20 , 1920 , and the detroit station that became wwj began program broadcasts beginning on august 20 , 1920 , although neither held a license at the time this station continued regular broadcasting of entertainment and cultural fare for several decades radio in education soon followed and colleges across the u.s a radio broadcasting station is usually associated with wireless transmission , though in practice broadcasting transmission ( sound and television ) take place using both wires and radio waves thumb broadcasting by radio takes several forms there are several subtypes , namely commercial broadcasting , non-commercial educational ( nce ) public broadcasting and non-profit varieties as well as community radio , student-run campus radio stations , and hospital radio stations can be found throughout the world many stations broadcast on shortwave bands using am technology that can be received over thousands of miles ( especially at night ) nielsen audio , formerly known as arbitron , the united states-based company that reports on radio audiences , defines a '' radio station '' as a government-licensed am or fm station ; an hd radio ( primary or multicast ) station ; an internet stream of an existing government-licensed station ; one of the satellite radio channels from xm satellite radio or sirius satellite radio ; or , potentially , a station that is not government licensed europe also uses the long wave band in response to the growing popularity of fm stereo radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s , some north american stations began broadcasting in am stereo , though this never gained popularity , and very few receivers were ever sold based on the '' interference '' entry of the concise oxford english dictionary , 11th edition , online one advantage of am radio signal is that it can be detected ( turned into sound ) with simple equipment if a signal is strong enough , not even a power source is needed ; building an unpowered crystal radio was a common childhood project in the early decades of am broadcasting am broadcasts occur on north american airwaves in the medium wave frequency range of 525 to 1705 khz ( known as the “ standard broadcast band ” ) russia , like the former soviet union , uses 65.9 to 74 & nbsp ; mhz frequencies in addition to the world standard at the same time , greater fidelity was made possible by spacing stations further apart in the radio frequency spectrum the improved fidelity made available was far in advance of the audio equipment of the 1940s , but wide interchannel spacing was chosen to take advantage of the noise-suppressing feature of wideband fm at the time fm was set up , the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for am radio - by a factor of approximately 100 using these frequencies meant that even at far higher power , the range of a given fm signal was much shorter ; thus its market was more local than for am radio regular fm broadcasting began in 1939 but did not pose a significant threat to the am broadcasting industry fm radio on the new band had to begin from the ground floor by the 1980s , since almost all new radios included both am and fm tuners , fm became the dominant medium , especially in cities rules and regulations vary largely from country to country , but often the term pirate radio generally describes the unlicensed broadcast of fm radio , am radio , or shortwave signals over a wide range in other cases , a broadcast may be considered '' pirate '' due to the type of content , its transmission format , or the transmitting power ( wattage ) of the station , even if the transmission is not technically illegal ( such as a webcast or an amateur radio transmission ) the simplest system is named dab digital radio , for digital audio broadcasting , and uses the public domain eureka 147 ( band iii ) system the broadcasting regulators of the united states and canada have chosen to use hd radio , an in-band on-channel system that puts digital broadcasts at frequencies adjacent to the analog broadcast during the cold war the american radio free europe and radio liberty and indian radio air were founded to broadcast news from '' behind the iron curtain '' that was otherwise being censored and promote dissent and occasionally , to disseminate disinformation for example , vatican radio , established in 1931 , broadcasts such programs radio program formats differ by country , regulation , and markets early radio equipment only allowed program material to be broadcast in real time , known as live broadcasting as technology for sound recording improved , an increasing proportion of broadcast programming used pre-recorded material a current trend is the automation of radio stations broadcasting construction permit call sign disc jockey ( dj ) history of broadcasting international broadcasting list of radio topics low power radio station radio radio antenna radio network radio personality rf modulation sports commentator television station '' empire of the air : the men who made radio '' ( 1992 ) by ken burns was a pbs documentary based on the book points on the dial : golden age radio beyond the networks ( duke university press ;
