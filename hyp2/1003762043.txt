while samples repeat each frame time , metadata is only transmitted once per audio block preambles are not normal bmc-encoded data bits , although they do still have zero dc bias 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 time slots _____ _ _____ _ / \_____/ \_/ \_____/ \_/ \ preamble x _____ _ ___ ___ / \___/ \___/ \_____/ \_/ \ preamble y _____ _ _ _____ / \_/ \_____/ \_____/ \_/ \ preamble z ___ ___ ___ ___ / \___/ \___/ \___/ \___/ \ all 0 bits bmc encoded _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ / \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \ all 1 bits bmc encoded 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 time slots in two-channel aes3 , the preambles form a pattern of zyxyxyxy… , but it is straightforward to extend this structure to additional channels ( more subframes per frame ) , each with a y preamble , as is done in the madi protocol there is one channel status bit in each subframe , a total of 192 bits or 24 bytes for each channel in each block byte 0 : basic control data : sample rate , compression , emphasis bit 0 : a value of 1 indicates this is aes3 channel status data bits 2–4 : indicates the type of signal preemphasis applied to the data these bits are redundant when real-time audio is transmitted ( the receiver can observe the sample rate directly ) , but are useful if aes3 data is recorded or otherwise stored bits 0–3 : indicates the relationship of the two channels ; they might be unrelated audio data , a stereo pair , duplicated mono data , music and voice commentary , a stereo sum/difference code bits 4–7 : used to indicate the format of the user channel word byte 2 : audio word length bits 0–2 : aux bits usage generally set to 000 ( unused ) or 001 ( used for 24-bit audio data ) unused bits are filled with 0 , but audio processing functions such as mixing will generally fill them in with valid data without changing the effective word length bits 6–7 : unused byte 3 : used only for multichannel applications byte 4 : additional sample rate information bits 0–1 : indicates the grade of the sample rate reference , per aes11 bit 2 : reserved bits 3–6 : extended sample rate bytes 14–17 : 32-bit sample address , incrementing block-to-block by 192 ( because there are 192 frames per block ) byte 22 : channel status word reliability indication bits 0–3 : reserved bit 4 : if set , bytes 0–5 ( signal format ) are unreliable bit 5 : if set , bytes 6–13 ( channel labels ) are unreliable bit 6 : if set , bytes 14–17 ( sample address ) are unreliable it is embedded as a 32-bit binary word in bytes 18 to 21 of the channel status data
