androgens like testosterone and particularly dht are importantly involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer in accordance , therapeutic modalities that reduce androgen signaling in the prostate gland , referred to collectively as androgen deprivation therapy , are able to significantly slow the course of prostate cancer and extend life in men with the disease although antiandrogens are effective in slowing the progression of prostate cancer , they are not generally curative , and with time , the disease adapts and androgen deprivation therapy eventually becomes ineffective when castration is combined with a nonsteroidal antiandrogen like bicalutamide , this strategy is referred to as combined androgen blockade ( also known as complete or maximal androgen blockade ) enzalutamide , apalutamide , and abiraterone acetate are specifically approved for use in combination with castration to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer as an alternative to castration with comparable effectiveness but with a different and potentially advantageous side effect profile cyproterone acetate was developed subsequently to high-dose estrogen and is the only steroidal antiandrogen that has been widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer , but it has largely been replaced by nonsteroidal antiandrogens , which are newer and have greater effectiveness , tolerability , and safety the earlier androgen synthesis inhibitors aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole have only limitedly been used in the treatment of prostate cancer due to toxicity concerns and have been replaced by abiraterone acetate 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride , dutasteride , and alfatradiol and the topical nonsteroidal ar antagonist topilutamide ( fluridil ) are approved for the treatment of pattern hair loss , also known as scalp hair loss or baldness systemic antiandrogens besides 5α-reductase inhibitors are not generally used to treat scalp hair loss in males due to risks like feminization ( e.g antiandrogens are generally not used to treat acne in males due to their high risk of feminization ( e.g spironolactone and bicalutamide require combination with an aromatase inhibitor to prevent the effects of unopposed estrogens , while the others can be used alone in addition to ar antagonists , oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol are effective in treating these conditions , and may be combined with ar antagonists there are several different types of antiandrogens , including the following : androgen receptor antagonists : drugs that bind directly to and block the ar the side effects of antiandrogens vary depending on the type of antiandrogen – namely whether it is a selective ar antagonist or lowers androgen levels – as well as the presence of off-target activity in the antiandrogen in question for instance , whereas antigonadotropic antiandrogens like gnrh modulators and cyproterone acetate are associated with pronounced sexual dysfunction and osteoporosis in men , selective ar antagonists like bicalutamide are not associated with osteoporosis and have been associated with only minimal sexual dysfunction these differences are thought related to the fact that antigonadotropins suppress androgen levels and by extension levels of bioactive metabolites of androgens like estrogens and neurosteroids whereas selective ar antagonists similarly neutralize the effects of androgens but leave levels of androgens and hence their metabolites intact ( and in fact can even increase them as a result of their progonadotropic effects ) as another example , the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate and spironolactone possess off-target actions including progestogenic , antimineralocorticoid , and/or glucocorticoid activity in addition to their antiandrogen activity , and these off-target activities can result in additional side effects conversely , the side effects of selective ar antagonists in women are minimal steroidal ar antagonists tend to have off-target activity due to their structural similarity to other steroid hormones although they are described as antiandrogens and indeed show only such effects generally , most or all steroidal ar antagonists are actually not silent antagonists of the ar but rather are weak partial agonists and are able to activate the receptor in the absence of more potent ar agonists like testosterone and dht as an example , steroidal ar antagonists are able to increase prostate weight and accelerate prostate cancer cell growth in the absence of more potent ar agonists , and spironolactone has been found to accelerate progression of prostate cancer in case reports this may be why they have greater efficacy than steroidal ar antagonists in the treatment of prostate cancer and is an important reason as to why they have largely replaced them for this indication in medicine ar ntd antagonists are under investigation for the potential treatment of prostate cancer , and it is thought that they may have greater efficacy as antiandrogens relative to conventional ar antagonists selective androgen receptor degraders ( sards ) are another new type of antiandrogen that has recently been developed they work by enhancing the degradation of the ar , and are analogous to selective estrogen receptor degraders ( serds ) like fulvestrant ( a drug used to treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer ) because these drugs all prevent the formation of glucocorticoids in addition to androgens , they must be combined with a glucocorticoid like prednisone to avoid adrenal insufficiency a newer drug currently under development for treatment of prostate cancer , seviteronel , is selective for inhibition of the 17,20-lyase functionality of cyp17a1 , and for this reason , unlike earlier drugs , does not require concomitant treatment with a glucocorticoid in addition to their antigonadotropic effects , estrogens are also functional antiandrogens by decreasing free concentrations of androgens via increasing the liver production of sex hormone-binding globulin ( shbg ) and by extension circulating shbg levels however , combined oral contraceptives that contain the particularly androgenic progestin levonorgestrel have been found to increase shbg levels by only 50 to 100 % , which is likely because activation of the ar in the liver has the opposite effect of estrogen and suppresses production of shbg levonorgestrel and certain other 19-nortestosterone progestins used in combined oral contraceptives like norethisterone also directly bind to and displace androgens from shbg , which may additionally antagonize the functional antiandrogenic effects of ethinylestradiol they are rarely used clinically as functional antiandrogens , but are used as such in the case of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in girls and women , in which there are excessive production and levels of adrenal androgens due to glucocorticoid deficiency and hence hpa axis overactivity metformin , an insulin-sensitizing medication , has indirect antiandrogenic effects in such women , decreasing testosterone levels by 50 % secondary to its beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity the following is a timeline of events in the history of antiandrogens : 1941 : hudgins and hodges show that androgen deprivation via high-dose estrogen therapy or surgical castration treats prostate cancer 1957 : the steroidal antiandrogen spironolactone

use in the united states , to treat prostate cancer 2006 : the second-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen enzalutamide is first described sawyers , c the term antiandrogen is generally used to refer specifically to ar antagonists , as described by dorfman ( 1970 ) : however , in spite of the above , the term may also be used to describe functional antiandrogens like androgen synthesis inhibitors and antigonadotropins , including even estrogens and progestogens unfortunately , whereas systemic administration of antiandrogens is very effective in treating these conditions , topical administration has disappointingly been found generally to possess limited and only modest effectiveness , even when high-affinity steroidal ar antagonists like cyproterone acetate and spironolactone have been employed moreover , in the specific case of acne treatment , topical ar antagonists have been found much less effective compared to established treatments like benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics while effective in suppressing male fertility , their use as monotherapies is precluded by side effects , such as hypoandrogenism ( e.g the combination of a primary antigonadotropin such as cyproterone acetate to prevent fertility and an androgen like testosterone to prevent systemic androgen deficiency , resulting in a selective antiandrogenic action locally in the testes , has been extensively studied and has shown promising results , but has not been approved for clinical use at this time antiandrogens may be effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder
