it was the advent of the steam ship , with its independence from wind power , which offered the possibility of regular , scheduled atlantic crossings , in periods of two to three weeks , that opened a new era of transatlantic travel and competition although not the first steamships to cross the atlantic ( savannah had crossed in 1819 , and royal william in 1831 ) nor the fastest to make the crossing ( the packet sailing ship columbia crossed west to east in 15 days 23 hours in 1830 , and crossings by sail packets of 16 and 17 days were not unheard of ) the sirius and great western were the first steamships offering a regular , scheduled trans-atlantic service ; and crucially , they were involved in a race smith , who is often considered the father of the atlantic liner , formed the british and american steam navigation company to operate a london-new york service about the same time , the question of atlantic steamships was discussed at an 1835 director 's meeting of the newly formed great western railway when the line 's chief engineer , isambard kingdom brunel supposedly joked that the line could be made longer by building a steamship to run between bristol and new york the next year , the great western steamship company was established , even though the rail line was still years from completion by spring 1838 , brunel 's was ready for sea , but smith 's first ship was still without engines george steam packet company for two voyages to beat great western with her westbound crossing at 8.03 knots ( 14.87 km/h ) , sirius is often considered the first record holder even though the notion would not be used for several generations the cunard line started its liverpool-halifax-boston service in 1840 with the four ships that were slightly reduced versions of great western with about the same speed cunard 's first serious competition for the record came from the american-owned collins line the american government supplied collins with a substantial subsidy to operate four wooden paddlers that were superior to cunard 's best the next year , cunard put further pressure on collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler , the persia , which set a new record with a 9-day , 16-hour liverpool-new york voyage at cunard emerged as the leading carrier of first class passengers and in 1862 commissioned the scotia , the last paddle steamer to set a record with a queenstown-new york voyage at scotia was the final significant paddler ordered for the atlantic because under the terms of cunard 's mail contract with the admiralty , it was still required to supply paddle steamers when needed for military service in 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the white star line commissioned oceanic and her five sisters during the five-year panic of 1873 that began in 1873 , william pearce , the controlling partner of the john elder shipyard , became convinced that a crack steamer that carried only passengers and light freight could be profitable because she would attract more passengers and spend less time in port the new owners provided the capital to build two outstanding record breakers , the twin screw and the starting in 1889 , the later ship set the record on four occasions , including a voyage at in 1892 white star , which had not built an express liner since the of 1875 , commissioned the record-breaker , of 1889 and of 1890 after receiving a subsidy from the admiralty to make the pair available as merchant cruisers in the event of hostilities inman became the american line and ordered two additional express liners from american yards , but no attempt was made to best the new cunarders beginning in the late 1860s , several german firms commissioned liners that were almost as fast as the british mail steamers working from liverpool hamburg america ordered the even more powerful that reached on one of her record-breaking 1900 voyages rather than match the new german speedsters , white star decided to drop out of the competition and commission the four large celtic-class luxury liners of more moderate speed after its bad experience with the deutschland , hamburg america also dropped out of the race and commissioned large luxury liners based on the celtic however , these ships paid a price for speed and lacked many of the amenities found in the new white star and hamburg american luxury liners using these funds , ndl ordered two ships designed to cross the atlantic in five days , the and in 1928 , as britain 's response to the german and , the white star line ordered a new diesel-electric 1000-ft long ocean liner to be named oceanic capable of 200,000 shp the next year , cunard started construction on an 80,000 ton liner that was to be the first of two record breakers fast enough to fit into a two ship weekly southampton-new york service in the 1930s , air travel was already competing with the express liners for fast atlantic crossings ; in 1936 , the german company delag commenced an airship service to new york , their hindenburg crossing from europe to america in times ranging from 53 to 78 hours , and the following year , while experimenting with a flying boat service , empire airways caledonia reduced this to 15 hours meanwhile , incat , builders of fast catamaran ferries , and therefore indisputably commercial vessels , decided to make an attempt to win the hales trophy , for which the record was still that of united states therefore , most lists feature sirius , in her race with great western in 1838 , as the first record-holder , although her crossing was not as fast as some sail packet ships of the period for example , gibbs credits inman 's city of paris with an 1866 blue riband voyage , and cunard 's russia with an eastbound record the following year because he considered as dubious scotia 's blue riband claim of , supposedly based on a very long track gibbs also includes the claimed blue riband voyage at of the national line 's america of 1884 that was not confirmed by later researchers
