in this process , enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism , where they break down an organic material , and some of the products diffuse back to the organism animals have a tube ( gastrointestinal tract ) in which internal digestion occurs , which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled some organisms , including nearly all spiders , simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals ( e.g in others , once potential nutrients or food is inside the organism , digestion can be conducted to a vesicle or a sac-like structure , through a tube , or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient pestis and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host 's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of opines , which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors in addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above , gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material : the formation of outer membrane vesicles vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors , some have immunomodulatory effects , and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body in a plant such as the venus flytrap that can make its own food through photosynthesis , it does not eat and digest its prey for the traditional objectives of harvesting energy and carbon , but mines prey primarily for essential nutrients ( nitrogen and phosphorus in particular ) that are in short supply in its boggy , acidic habitat the tongue is utilized to roll food particles into a bolus before being transported down the esophagus through peristalsis human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception certain insects may have a crop or enlarged esophagus in the first two chambers , the rumen and the reticulum , the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material it serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein , preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine digesta is finally moved into the small intestine , where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine they also produce normal droppings , which are not eaten the esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay when the churning is complete , the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste , which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter by peristalsis , the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown in most vertebrates , digestion is a multistage process in the digestive system , starting from ingestion of raw materials , most often other organisms digestion is separated into four steps : ingestion : placing food into the mouth ( entry of food in the digestive system ) , mechanical and chemical breakdown : mastication and the mixing of the resulting bolus with water , acids , bile and enzymes in the stomach and intestine to break down complex molecules into simple structures , absorption : of nutrients from the digestive system to the circulatory and lymphatic capillaries through osmosis , active transport , and diffusion , and egestion ( excretion ) : removal of undigested materials from the digestive tract through defecation the large intestine primarily serves as a site for fermentation of indigestible matter by gut bacteria and for resorption of water from digests before excretion in mammals , preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed , and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches the stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes food digestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal , and the process of digestion normally takes between 24 and 72 hours gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection in the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach in the small intestine , the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile , pancreatic juice and intestinal juice acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal ( secretes acid ) and g cell ( secretes gastrin ) activity via d cell secretion of somatostatin the digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors , the zymogens in humans , dietary starches are composed of glucose units arranged in long chains called amylose , a polysaccharide some nutrients are complex molecules ( for example vitamin b12 ) which would be destroyed if they were broken down into their functional groups to digest vitamin b 12 non-destructively , haptocorrin in saliva strongly binds and protects the b 12 molecules from stomach acid as they enter the stomach and are cleaved from their protein complexes these b 12 -if complexes travel to the ileum portion of the small intestine where cubilin receptors enable assimilation and circulation of b 12 -if complexes in the blood another function is to induce insulin release motilin â€“ is in the duodenum and increases the migrating myoelectric complex component of gastrointestinal motility and stimulates the production of pepsin ph plays a crucial role in a normally functioning digestive tract this acidity confers two benefits : it denatures proteins for further digestion in the small intestines , and provides innate immune system , damaging or eliminating various pathogens in the small intestines , the duodenum provides critical ph balancing to activate digestive enzymes
