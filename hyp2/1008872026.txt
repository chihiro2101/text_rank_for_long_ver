thus , it originally meant '' all kinds of salted ( meats ) '' the italian tradition of cured meats includes several styles , and the word salame soon specifically meant only the most popular kind—a salted and spiced meat , ground and extruded into an elongated , thin casing ( usually cleaned animal intestine ) , then left to undergo natural fermentation and drying for days , months , or even years also , environmental conditions dictate what food processes are used , as seen in the mediterranean and southern europe , where '' meat products are dried to lower water activity ( aw ) values , taking advantage of the long dry and sunny days , while in northern europe , fermented sausages require smoking for further preservation additionally , each sausage has its own type of seasonings and amount of salt , making each flavor and texture unique typical additional ingredients include : garlic minced fat salt spices , usually white pepper various herbs vinegar wine the maker usually ferments the raw meat mixture for a day , then stuffs it into either an edible natural or inedible cellulose casing , and hangs it up to cure minor differences in the formulation of the meat or production techniques give rise to the various kinds of salami across different countries before fermentation , raw meat ( usually pork or beef depending on the type of salami that is produced ) is ground ( usually coarsely ) and mixed with other ingredients such as salt , sugar , spices , pepper and yeast , and , if the particular salami variety requires it , lactic acid bacterial starter culture to achieve the flavor and texture that salami possesses , fermentation , which can also be referred to as a slow acidification process promoting a series of chemical reactions in the meat , has to take place salami flavor relies as much on how these bacteria are cultivated as it does on the quality and variety of the other ingredients originally , makers introduced wine into the mix , favouring the growth of other beneficial bacteria : ecology of lactic acid bacteria and coagulase negative cocci in fermented dry sausages manufactured in italy and other mediterranean countries : an overview , in : international food research journal 23 ( 2 ) : 429-445 ( 2016 ) or micrococcus len poli : making salami at home , sonoma mountain sausage , 4 september 2016 are most commonly used in salami production despite the fact that these bacteria can help maintain a longer shelf life for meat products and even retard the growth of pathogens , there are a few studies that argue some starter cultures may be related to the production of enterotoxins or biogenic amines that can be harmful to the human body when smoke is applied to salami , it also affects the taste , smell , appearance , and texture the main cause of flavour deterioration in dry-cured sausage is rancidity , though the possible formation of other off-flavours , such as mouldy , acid , putrid or pungent traits , may contribute to the decreased quality the use of coriander essential oil in salami has been shown to increase the higher synthetic antioxidant effect of butylated hydroxytoluene , which delays lipid oxidation and the rancid aroma and taste that come with it in northeast italy , traditional dry fermented salami sausages made of fresh pork display unique organoleptic sensory profiles characterized by accented acidity , slight sourness , and elastic semi hard consistency this type of traditional sausage , which undergoes an adventitious fermentation , is of superior quality compared to those inoculated with starters and made in industrial scale in germany , westphalian salami is made with fast technology from pork meat , pepper , garlic , and sometimes mustard seeds , and is smoked , firm , sliceable product with a distinct fermentation/sour flavor a particular feature of moscow-type salami is the large size of fat particles ( 7–8 & nbsp ; mm ) that give the sausage a rough cover salami has been found to be a possible allergen to some people due to the use of penicillium species mold starter during the drying and curing portion of processing to add flavor and stop growth of undesirable molds however , it has been shown that it is possible to replace the pork back fat in salami with extra virgin olive oil , thereby changing the fatty acid profile of the salami salami where extra virgin olive oil was substituted for the pork back fat has been shown to have a lower ph of around 5.00 compared to its original levels of around 6.35 to 6.55 , making the salami more acidic several types of oils including rosemary , clove , oregano and sage oils were found to have different levels of inhibition effect to various types of fungi that could possibly grow on salami since several of these oils contain volatile compounds whose amount can affect the flavor of the food , researchers often perform a sensory test to find the amount of the oil that can best serve as an anti-fungal preservative but have the least effect on the flavor or appearance of the salami
