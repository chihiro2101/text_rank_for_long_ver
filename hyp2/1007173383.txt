the site of this edifice , centred at the end of rue royale , a line-of-sight between gabriel 's twin hôtels in the place de la concorde , required a suitably monumental end from the time that square was established in 1755 , as place louis xv two false starts were made in building a church on this site the first design , commissioned in 1757 , with construction begun with the king 's ceremonial placing of the cornerstone , 3 april 1763 , was halted in 1764 ; that first design , by pierre contant d'ivry , was based on jules hardouin mansart ’ s late baroque church of les invalides , with a dome surmounting a latin cross at the start of the french revolution , however , only the foundations and the grand portico had been finished ; the choir of the former church was demolished in 1797 , but work was discontinued while debate simmered as to what purpose the eventual building might serve in revolutionary france : a library , a public ballroom , and a marketplace were all suggested after the execution of louis xvi his body was immediately transported to the old church of the madeleine ( demolished in 1799 ) , since the legislation in force forbade burial of his remains beside those of his father , the dauphin louis de france , at sens in 1806 napoleon made his decision to erect a memorial , a temple de la gloire de la grande armée ( '' temple to the glory of the great army '' ) ; following an elaborate competition with numerous entries and a jury that decided on a design by the architect claude étienne de beaumont ( 1757–1811 ) , the emperor trumped all , instead commissioning pierre-alexandre vignon ( 1763–1828 ) to build his design on an antique temple ( compare the maison carrée , in nîmes ) the then-existing foundations were razed , preserving the standing columns , and work begun anew after the fall of napoleon , with the catholic reaction during the restoration , king louis xviii determined that the structure would be used as a church , dedicated to mary magdalene in 1837 it was briefly suggested that the building might best be utilised as a railway station , but the building was finally consecrated as a church in 1842 the half-dome above the altar is frescoed by jules-claude ziegler , entitled the history of christianity , showing the key figures in the christian religion with – a sign of its second empire date – napoleon occupying centre stage
