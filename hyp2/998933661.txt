a major problem within discourse on intentionality is that participants often fail to make explicit whether or not they use the term to imply concepts such as agency or desire , i.e however , most philosophers use '' intentionality '' to mean something with no teleological import ryle insisted that perceiving is not a process , and ayer that describing one 's knowledge is not to describe mental processes the effect of these positions is that consciousness is so fully intentional that the mental act has been emptied of all content , and that the idea of pure consciousness is that it is nothing chisholm 's writings have attempted to summarize the suitable and unsuitable criteria of the concept since the scholastics , arriving at a criterion of intentionality identified by the two aspects of brentano 's thesis and defined by the logical properties that distinguish language describing psychological phenomena from language describing non-psychological phenomena in current artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind , intentionality is sometimes linked with questions of semantic inference , with both skeptical and supportive adherents john searle argued for this position with the chinese room thought experiment , according to which no syntactic operations that occurred in a computer would provide it with semantic content others are more skeptical of the human ability to make such an assertion , arguing that the kind of intentionality that emerges from self-organizing networks of automata will always be undecidable because it will never be possible to make our subjective introspective experience of intentionality and decision making coincide with our objective observation of the behavior of a self-organizing machine such a position could be motivated by a form of semantic externalism , the view that the meaning of a term , or in this example the content of a thought , is determined by factors external to the subject if meaning depends on successful reference then failing to refer would result in a lack of meaning so if mary perceives a tree , we might say that a perceptual relation holds between mary , the subject of this relation , and the tree , the object of this relation relations are usually assumed to be existence-entailing : the instance of a relation entails the existence of its relata but one way to solve the problem is to deny this principle and argue for a kind of intentionality exceptionalism : that intentionality is different from all other relations in the sense that this principle does n't apply to it a more common relationalist solution is to look for existing objects that can play the role that the non-existing object was supposed to play so no independent objects are needed besides the subject , which is how adverbialists avoid the problem of non-existence adverbialism has been challenged on the grounds that it puts a strain on natural language and the metaphysical insights encoded in it members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects , which may imply some kind of dualism ( though this is debatable ) holders of realism argue that there is a deeper fact of the matter to both translation and belief attribution in other words , manuals for translating one language into another can not be set up in different yet behaviorally identical ways and ontologically there are intentional objects dennett comments on this issue , fodor '' attempts to make these irreducible realities acceptable to the physical sciences by grounding them ( somehow ) in the 'syntax ' of a system of physically realized mental representations '' ( dennett 1987 , 345 ) those who adhere to the so-called quinean double standard ( namely that ontologically there is nothing intentional , but that the language of intentionality is indispensable ) , accept quine 's thesis of the indeterminacy of translation and its implications , while the other positions so far mentioned do not as quine puts it , indeterminacy of radical translation is the thesis that '' manuals for translating one language into another can be set up in divergent ways , all compatible with the totality of speech dispositions , yet incompatible with one another '' ( quine 1960 , 27 ) one such implication would be that there is , in principle , no deeper fact of the matter that could settle two interpretative strategies on what belief to attribute to a physical system in other words , the behavior ( including speech dispositions ) of any physical system , in theory , could be interpreted by two different predictive strategies and both would be equally warranted in their belief attribution this category can be seen to be a medial position between the realists and the eliminativists since it attempts to blend attributes of both into a theory of intentionality dennett , for example , argues in true believers ( 1981 ) that intentional idiom ( or '' folk psychology '' ) is a predictive strategy and if such a strategy successfully and voluminously predicts the actions of a physical system , then that physical system can be said to have those beliefs attributed to it an intentional state is transparent if it satisfies the following two conditions : ( i ) it is genuinely relational in that it entails the existence of not just the intender but the intendum as well , and ( ii ) substitutivity of identicals applies to the intendum ( i.e both pure and impure intentionalism hold that there is a supervenience relation between phenomenal features and intentional features , for example , that two intentional states ca n't differ regarding their phenomenal features without differing at the same time in their intentional features qualia theories , on the other hand , assert that among the phenomenal features of a mental state there are at least some non-intentional phenomenal properties , so-called '' qualia '' , which are not determined by intentional features pure and impure intentionalism disagree with each other concerning which intentional features are responsible for determining the phenomenal features pure intentionalists hold that only intentional content is responsible , while impure intentionalists assert that the manner or mode how this content is presented also plays a role they may argue , for example , that the difference in the last case also belongs to intentional content , because two different properties are ascribed to the apple : seen-roundness and felt-roundness critics of intentionalism , so-called anti-intentionalists , have proposed various apparent counterexamples to intentionalism : states that are considered mental but lack intentionality some anti-intentionalist theories , such as that of ned block , are based on the argument that phenomenal conscious experience or qualia is also a vital component of consciousness , and that it is not intentional a further form argues that some unusual states of consciousness are non-intentional , although an individual might live a lifetime without experiencing them forman argues that some of the unusual states of consciousness typical of mystical experience are pure consciousness events in which awareness exists , but has no object , is not awareness '' of '' anything several authors have attempted to construct philosophical models describing how intentionality relates to the human capacity to be self-conscious he centered his model on the idea that executive attention need not be propositional in form
