technology can be used theoretically or practically to render real-world objects invisible : making use of a real-time image displayed on a wearable display , it is possible to create a see-through effect engineers and scientists have performed various kinds of research to investigate the possibility of finding ways to create real optical invisibility ( cloaks ) for objects the technique is predicted to be applied to radio waves within five years , and the distortion of visible light is an eventual possibility the theory that light waves can be acted upon the same way as radio waves is now a popular idea among scientists comparing light waves to the water , and whatever object that is being '' cloaked '' to the stone , the goal is to have light waves pass around that object , leaving no visible aspects of it , possibly not even a shadow they demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional ( 3-d ) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar , light or other waves around an object '' uc berkeley researcher jason valentine 's team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum , in a region used in fibre optics : 'instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water , it would actually appear to be above the water 's surface next to perfect transparent scene by producing nanotechnologic material that can also be produced like a suit anyone can wear in 2019 , hyperstealth biotechnology has patented the technology behind a material that bends light to make people and objects near invisible to the naked eye where magical invisibility is concerned , the issue may arise of whether the clothing worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible in general they are also regarded as being invisible , but in some instances clothing remains visible and must be removed for the full invisibility effect .
