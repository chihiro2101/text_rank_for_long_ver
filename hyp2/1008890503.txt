one way to classify intersections is by the number of road segments ( arms ) that are involved however , two roads may cross at a different angle six-way intersections usually involve a crossing of three streets at one junction ; for example , a crossing of two perpendicular streets and a diagonal street is a rather common type of 6-way intersection priority ( right-of-way ) rules may vary by country : on a 4-way intersection traffic from the right often has priority ; on a 3-way intersection either traffic from the right has priority again , or traffic on the continuing road signal-controlled intersections depend on traffic signals , usually electric , which indicate which traffic is allowed to proceed at any particular time certain turns may be not allowed or may be limited by regulatory signs or signals , particularly those that cross oncoming traffic at intersections with large proportions of turning traffic , turn lanes ( also known as turn bays ) may be provided , a left turn in right-side driving countries , or a right turn in left-side driving countries ) , or to exit a road without crossing traffic ( i.e instead , traffic control signs are used to prohibit specific turns in rural areas , crash frequency can be reduced by up to 48 % if left turn lanes are provided on both main-road approaches at stop-controlled intersections in europe , if different lanes have differing phases , red , yellow and green traffic lights corresponding to each lane have blacked-out areas in the middle in the shape of arrows indicating the direction ( s ) drivers in that lane may travel in without a separate phase , left crossing traffic does not get the full safety benefit of the turn lane these include the michigan left/superstreet ( rcut/mut ) and continuous flow intersection ( cfi/dlt ) , to improve traffic flow , and also interchange types like diverging diamond interchange ( ddi/dcd ) design as part of the federal highway administration 's every day counts initiative which started in 2012 intersections generally must manage pedestrian as well as vehicle traffic known as a pedestrian scramble , this type of vehicle all-way stop allows pedestrians to cross safely in any direction , including diagonally
