'' , done when larry first plays '' pop goes the weasel '' , ended up being reused as a stock overdub in several future stooge shorts featuring curly this is the first film in which curly calls himself a '' victim of soycumstance ! '' ( circumstance ) : this comment would become one of curly 's catch-phrases when the stooges are taking part in curly 's first workout as a boxer ( rowing down the street ) , larry is playing a tune on his violin that sounds akin to '' let 's fall in love '' , a song sung 23 years later by the character tiny ( muriel landers ) in the stooge film sweet and hot larry , who has hidden behind the door of the dressing room , suddenly appears , attempting to play a snippet of the same song , later on in the film for the young lady in the dressing room before moe angrily uses a bucket of water to put on his head , to tell him to go upstairs to the arena punch drunks : stooge goofs the short ends with the playing of the song '' pop goes the weasel '' , which would become the opening theme for the short pop goes the easel during the fight , when larry is seen running down the street , curly 's voice can be heard in the distance saying , '' run ! all the way ! '' after a few seconds , he also says ‘ then come back ! ’ this happens twice in the film this film features a rare scene in which moe smacks someone other than one of his two pals ; as several people begin to rub curly down after a rather painful round of boxing and accidentally pull moe into it , he slaps one of them in the back of the head
