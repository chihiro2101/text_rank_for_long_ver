these can see almost as well , since those frequencies are less affected by water-vapor absorption , but generally require a more expensive sensor array , along with cryogenic cooling many camera systems use digital image processing to improve the image quality in warfare , they have three distinct advantages over other imaging technologies : the imager itself is nearly impossible to detect for the enemy , as it detects energy emitted from the target rather than sending out energy that is reflected from the target , as with radar or sonar sideways-tracking imagers normally involve a one-dimensional ( 1d ) array of pixels , which uses the motion of the aircraft or satellite to move the view of the 1d array across the ground to build up a 2d image over time such systems can not be used for real-time imaging and must look perpendicular to the direction of travel in 1956 texas instruments began research on infrared technology that led to several line scanner contracts and , with the addition of a second scan mirror , the invention of the first forward-looking infrared camera in 1963 , with production beginning in 1966 the cost of thermal imaging equipment in general has fallen dramatically after inexpensive portable and fixed infrared detectors and systems based on microelectromechanical systems were designed and manufactured for commercial , industrial and military application current directions in sensor technologies at nvesd , keynote presentation at spie dss ir technology & applications xli conference , baltimore , 20â€“23 april 2015 ( distribution statement a : approved for public release ) also , older camera designs used rotating mirrors to scan the image to a small sensor white paper : uncooled infrared detectors achieve new performance levels and cost targets , sofradir ec , inc fbi spy planes used thermal imaging tech in flights over baltimore after freddie gray unrest , the washington post , october 30 , 2015 a flir talon multi-sensor camera system equipped with an infrared laser pointer ( which is invisible to casual observers ) for illumination purposes was used to gather data at night
