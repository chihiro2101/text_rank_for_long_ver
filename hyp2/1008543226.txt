proplastids and young chloroplasts commonly divide by binary fission , but more mature chloroplasts also have this capacity plant proplastids ( undifferentiated plastids ) may differentiate into several forms , depending upon which function they perform in the cell they may develop into any of the following variants : chloroplasts : typically green plastids used for photosynthesis the number of genome copies per plastid is variable , ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly cell division , which , in general , contain few plastids , to 100 or fewer in mature cells , where plastid divisions have given rise to a large number of plastids plant nuclear genes encode the vast majority of plastid proteins , and the expression of plastid genes and nuclear genes is tightly co-regulated to coordinate proper development of plastids in relation to cell differentiation during the development of proplastids to chloroplasts , and when plastids convert from one type to another , nucleoids change in morphology , size and location within the organelle the remodelling of nucleoids is believed to occur by modifications to the composition and abundance of nucleoid proteins many plastids , particularly those responsible for photosynthesis , possess numerous internal membrane layers in plant cells , long thin protuberances called stromules sometimes form and extend from the main plastid body into the cytosol and interconnect several plastids muroplasts : also known as cyanoplasts or cyanelles , the chloroplasts of glaucophyte algae are similar to plant chloroplasts , except that they have a peptidoglycan cell wall that is similar to that of prokaryote the chloroplasts of plants differ from the rhodoplasts in their ability to synthesize starch , which is stored in the form of granules within the plastids their function differs from the leucoplasts of plants plastids in algae and hornworts may also differ from plant plastids in that they contain pyrenoids three evolutionary lineages in the archaeplastida have since emerged in which the plastids are named differently : chloroplasts in green algae and plants , rhodoplasts in red algae , and muroplasts in the glaucophytes for example , chloroplasts in plants and green algae have lost all phycobilisomes , the light harvesting complexes found in cyanobacteria , red algae and glaucophytes , but instead contain stroma and grana thylakoids
