to make matters still worse , as a new make , edsel had no established brand loyalty with buyers , as its competing makes had at the time , breech 's assessment was basically correct ; in 1955 , pontiac , buick and dodge had sold a combined two million units attempting to capitalize on the emerging consumer interest in economy cars , american motors shifted its focus to its compact rambler models and discontinued its pre-merger brands , nash and hudson , after the 1957 model year when desoto sales failed to rebound during the 1959 model year , plans were made in highland park to discontinue the nameplate by 1961 sales for most car manufacturers , even those not introducing new models , were down among domestic makes , only rambler and lincoln produced more cars in 1958 than in 1957 ford motor company had conducted the right marketing study , but it came up with the wrong product to fill the gap between ford and mercury ford 's investment in expanded plant capacity and additional tooling for edsels helped make the company 's subsequent success with the falcon possible the name of the car , edsel , is also often cited as a further reason for its lack of popularity early favorites for the name brand included citation , corsair , pacer , and ranger , which were ultimately chosen for the vehicle 's series names even though edsels shared basic technology with other ford cars of the era , a number of issues caused reliability problems , mostly with the 1958 models reports of mechanical flaws with the cars surfaced , due primarily to lack of quality control and confusion of parts with other ford models engineers , fearing engine cooling problems , vetoed the intended design , so a ring design was suggested the vertical grille theme , while improved for the 1959 models , was discontinued for the 1960 models , which were similar to ford models of the same year , although coincidentally , the new front-end design was very similar to that of the 1959 pontiac however , there was little that could be done to give the ford-based station wagons a unique appearance from the rear , because corporate management had insisted that no sheetmetal could be changed this design was similar to chevrolet big-block engine , which was also introduced in 1958 while the design reduced the cost of manufacture and may also have helped minimize carbon buildup , it was also unfamiliar to many mechanics mcnamara was very much a throwback to henry ford in that , like the elder ford , mcnamara was committed to the ford marque to the almost total exclusion of the company 's other products thus , mcnamara had little use for the continental , lincoln , mercury and edsel brand cars made by the company mcnamara saw to it that the continental program was canceled and that the model was merged into the lincoln range for 1958 instead , edsels would share the ford platform and use ford 's inner body structure for 1959 by 1960 , edsels emerged as little more than a ford with different trim the final blow came in the fall of 1959 , when mcnamara convinced henry ford ii and the rest of ford 's management that edsel was doomed and that it was time to end production before edsel bled the company dry had nothing to do with the plans for the edsel car or any part of the program prior to the closure of the edsel division , the brand was intending to release the edsel comet compact for the 1960 model year , sharing a body with the ford falcon while sold without divisional branding , the comet proved successful ; lincoln-mercury sold more 1960 comets than the entire edsel model line sold through its 1958-1960 existence , which were considered '' too impractical '' in the late 1950s , are now standard features of current production vehicles a mint-condition edsel convertible from any of its three model years may sell for over 100,000 these command premium prices today , especially the rare 1959 and 1960 models
