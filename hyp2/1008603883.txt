one of the most important marks that mahler left on the symphony as a genre is the incorporation of another important genre of the 19th century ; the lied although the song plays a similar role in the song cycle , being surrounded by darker-themed songs , mahler changes the order of the strophes as originally found in the song in the third movement of the symphony , the quotation of the lied '' '' demonstrates the subtlety with which mahler combined the two genres in the last verse of the song cycle , the speaker acknowledges the painlessness of death , saying , '' under the linden tree i knew not how life fared , there all was good again ! '' this melody is employed as a countermelody to the '' fr√®re jacques '' theme in the minor mode , but the counterpoint that mahler uses is unconventional , and the two melodies are never properly consolidated looking at the programmes that he provided , one can see many connections between the song cycle and the symphony 's programmatic elements , but then it must also be taken into consideration that mahler later removed the programmes among this uncertainty though , it is clear that some narrative elements that are associated with the poet and composer of a lied were transferred from the song cycle to the symphony shortly after this , the symphony was published without the blumine movement and in the subsequent versions of the symphony it was gone the style of this movement has much in common with mahler 's earlier works but also shows the techniques and distinct style of his later compositions however , many people did not agree about playing this music as part of the symphony others perform blumine before or after the symphony , while still others have performed it on its own or alongside mahler 's other works
