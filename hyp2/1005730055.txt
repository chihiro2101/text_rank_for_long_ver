the voice coil produces a varying magnetic field , which works against the fixed magnetic field of a magnet around which the cylindrical voice coil is suspended , forcing the voice coil and the diaphragm attached to it to move however , smaller dome tweeters have less radiating area , which limits their output at the lower end of their range ; and they have smaller voice coils , which limit their overall power output the fluid is typically injected into the magnetic gap and is held in place by the strong magnetic field in extreme cases , this can degrade the sound quality and output level of a tweeter , and the fluid must be removed and new fluid installed tweeters designed for sound reinforcement and musical instrument applications are broadly similar to high fidelity tweeters , though they 're usually not referred to as tweeters , but as '' high frequency drivers '' key design requirement differences are : mountings built for repeated shipping and handling , drivers often mounted to horn structures to provide for higher sound levels and greater control of sound dispersion , and more robust voice coils to withstand the higher power levels typically encountered the diaphragm is glued to a voice coil former , typically made from a different material from the dome , since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change the diaphragm is generally shaped like an inverted dome and loads into a series of tapered channels in a central structure called a phase plug , which equalizes the path length between various areas of the diaphragm and the horn throat , preventing acoustic cancellations between different points on the diaphragm surface the optimizations usually are : a very small and light cone so it can move rapidly ; cone materials chosen for stiffness ( e.g , paper , silk or coated fabric ) or both ; a suspension ( or spider ) that is stiffer than for other drivers—less flexibility is needed for high frequency reproduction ; small voice coils ( 3/4 inch is typical ) and light ( thin ) wire , which also helps the tweeter cone move rapidly typical of the 1960s/1970s-era was the cts '' phenolic ring '' cone tweeters , exhibiting flat response from 2,000 to 15,000 & nbsp ; hz , low distortion and fast transient response cone tweeters are now rarely used in modern hi-fi usage and are routinely seen in low cost applications such as factory car speakers , compact stereo systems , and boom boxes an audio signal is applied to the crystal , which responds by flexing in proportion to the voltage applied across the crystal 's surfaces , thus converting electrical energy into mechanical when an electric field is applied across the material , the polarized molecules will align themselves with the electric field , resulting in induced dipoles within the molecular or crystal structure of the material piezo tweeters rarely get used in high-end audio because of their low fidelity , although they did feature in some high-end designs of the late ‘ 70s , such as the celef pe1 in which they were utilised as a super tweeter in combination with a conventional dome tweeter a ribbon tweeter uses a very thin diaphragm ( often of aluminum , or perhaps metalized plastic film ) that supports a planar coil frequently made by deposition of aluminium vapor , suspended in a powerful magnetic field ( typically provided by neodymium magnets ) to reproduce high frequencies the ribbon is of very lightweight material and so capable of very high acceleration and extended high frequency response ribbons have traditionally been incapable of high output ( large magnet gaps leading to poor magnetic coupling is the main reason ) but higher power versions of ribbon tweeters are becoming common in large-scale sound reinforcement line array systems , which can serve audiences of thousands these drivers can easily be stacked vertically , building a high frequency line array that produces high sound pressure levels much farther away from the speaker locations than do conventional tweeters electrostatics of this type necessarily include a high voltage power supply to provide the high voltage used they are capable of considerable output levels and are rather more sturdy than electrostatics or ribbons , but have similar low-mass moving elements horns are used for two purposes — to control dispersion , and to couple the tweeter diaphragm to the air for higher efficiency the larger the horn , the lower the frequencies at which it can work , since large horns provide coupling to the air at lower frequencies they are more complex than other tweeters ( plasma generation is not required in other types ) , but offer the advantage that the moving mass is optimally low , and so very responsive to the signal input these types of tweeters are not capable of high output , nor of other than very high frequency reproduction , and so are usually used at the throat of a horn structure to manage usable output levels these early models were finicky and required regular replacement of the cell in which the plasma was generated ( the dukane unit used a precision machined quartz cell )
