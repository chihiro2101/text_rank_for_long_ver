106 his german jewish heritage and his assimilated wealth were both factors in establishing his deeply divisive reputation in german politics at a time of antisemitism among gentiles he summed up his feelings about growing up in germany : i am a german of jewish origin my people are the german people , my home is germany , my faith is german faith , which stands above all denominations he returned to berlin and joined the aeg board in 1899 , becoming a leading industrialist in the late german empire and early weimar republic periods as the dual monarchy 's relations with russia drifted , the paper described a secret conspiracy at work in moltke 's war department in which he had taken part he held senior posts in the raw materials department of the war ministry and became chairman of aeg upon his father 's death in 1915 rathenau played a key role in convincing the war ministry to set up the war raw materials department ( kriegsrohstoffabteilung , kra ) , of which he was put in charge from august 1914 to march 1915 and established the fundamental policies and procedures rathenau wrote about personal and social responsibility to the community at a time when solidarity was required to keep the peace according to one biographer he is said to have identified a sense of inferiority with his jewishness , writing that he realised completely for the first time that he had come into this world as a second-class citizen and that no amount of ability and merit could ever free him from this condition 106 one heavy criticism which he bore stoically was the implication that jews could never put germany first ; the idea that the jews were '' our misfortune '' , as the german nationalist historian heinrich treitschke wrote , led to the proliferation from 1880s of anti-semitic parties rathenau was a moderate liberal in politics , and after world war i , he was one of the founders of the german democratic party ( german : deutsche demokratische partei , ddp ) , but he moved to the left in the advent of post-war chaos ebert 's election by the left failed to heal the deep rifts and social divisions in german society that occurred throughout the weimar but his own adequacy was under-appreciated ; immediately giving rise to extreme right-wing organizations within months of the communist-inspired spartacist revolt , '' the product of a state in which for centuries no one has ruled who was not a member of , or a convert to military feudalism berlin 's march days was a consequence of the internal struggle between finance and economic ministries on 20 february 1919 he proposed workers councils '' which had already been explained in his writings '' the plan for a socialist league of nations was overtly pro-union mocked as the '' paris league '' – a throwback to the second communist international – they challenged openly for democratic ideas but a rapprochement with soviet union was inspired by rathenau ; it tried to prevent an expansive 'greater germany ' bravely rathenau held out against the partition of poland ; despite erzberger 's assassination ; and threats for extreme national bolshevists when he joined joseph wirth 's government after cannes on 31 january 1922 , there was a horrible fear that his days were numbered he also angered such extremists by negotiating on 22 january 1922 treaty of rapallo with the soviet union , although the treaty implicitly recognized secret german-soviet collaboration begun in 1921 that provided for the rearmament of germany , including german-owned aircraft manufacturing in russian territory . the leaders of the ( still obscure ) national socialist german workers ' party ( german : nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei , abbreviated nsdap ) and other extremist groups falsely claimed he was part of a '' jewish bolshevism , '' despite the fact that he was a liberal german nationalist who had bolstered the country 's recent war effort the british politician robert boothby wrote of him , '' he was something that only a german jew could simultaneously be : a prophet , a philosopher , a mystic , a writer , a statesman , an industrial magnate of the highest and greatest order , and the pioneer of what has become known as 'industrial rationalization ' '' despite his desire for economic and political co-operation between germany and the soviet union , rathenau remained skeptical of the methods of the soviets : w.r rathenau moved ever closer to a rejection of religion , embracing the power of science he tried to bring people 's attention to what changes would be required for a futuristic romantic movement in von kommenden dingen to openly challenge the living of lives 72–77 ; 103–8 the theories of mechanization argued that competition could not go on forever as it died in love intellectual perorations were reached in pronouncements preceding a great vision for the future of german business while fischer and kern prepared their plot , former chancellor philipp scheidemann barely survived an attempt on his life by organisation consul assassins on 4 june 1922 ehrhardt and his men believed that rathenau 's death would bring down the government and prompt the left to act against the weimar republic , thereby provoking civil war , in which the organisation consul would be called on for help by the reichswehr although fischer and kern connected with the berlin chapter of the organisation consul to use its resources , they mainly acted on their own in planning and carrying out the assassination their aims were not achieved , however , and civil war did not come when the news of rathenau 's death became known in the reichstag , the session turned into turmoil during the official memorial ceremony the next day , chancellor joseph wirth from the centre party made a speech which soon became famous , in which , while pointing to the right side of the parliamentary floor , he used the well known formula of philipp scheidemann : '' there is the enemy – and there is no doubt about it : this enemy is on the right ! '' the crime itself was soon cleared up after a daring flight , which kept germany in suspense for more than two weeks , they were finally spotted at saaleck castle in thuringia , whose owner was himself a secret member of the organisation consul fischer then took his own life kern had , according to ernst werner techow , argued that rathenau had to be murdered , because he had intimate relations with bolshevik russia , so that he had even married off his sister to the communism karl radek – a complete fabrication – and that rathenau himself had confessed to be one of the three hundred '' elders of zion '' the most notable reaction was the enactment of the ( law for the defense of the republic ) , which took effect on 22 july 1922 rathenau is generally acknowledged to be , in part , the basis for the german noble and industrialist paul arnheim , a character in robert musil 's novel the man without qualities '' walther rathenau : a pioneer of the planned economy , '' economic history review ( 1951 ) 4 1 pp '' walther rathenau and german foreign policy : thoughts and actions , '' journal of modern history ( 1952 ) 24 2 pp
