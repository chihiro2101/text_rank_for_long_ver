some forms of deception include : lies : making up information or giving information that is the opposite or very different from the truth concealments : omitting information that is important or relevant to the given context , or engaging in behavior that helps hide relevant information buller and burgoon ( 1996 ) have proposed three taxonomies to distinguish motivations for deception based on their interpersonal deception theory : instrumental : to avoid punishment or to protect resources relational : to maintain relationships or bonds identity : to preserve “ face ” or the self-image while it is difficult to deceive a partner over a long period of time , deception often occurs in day-to-day conversations between relational partners detecting deception is difficult because there are no known completely reliable indicators of deception and because people often reply on a truth-default state as a result , deceivers often leak important information both verbally and nonverbally many people believe that they are good at deception , though this confidence is often misplaced lying requires deliberate conscious behavior , so listening to speech and watching body language are important factors in detecting lies if a response to a question has a lot disturbances , less talking time , repeated words , and poor logical structure , then the person may be lying the liars that experience guilt have been shown to make attempts at putting distance between themselves and the deceptive communication , producing “ nonimmediacy cues ” these can be verbal or physical , including speaking in more indirect ways and showing an inability to maintain eye contact with their conversation partners in a more abstract sense , 'disguise ' may refer to the act of disguising the nature of a particular proposal in order to hide an unpopular motivation or effect associated with that proposal omitting relevance : not stating something that is helpful to know , for example , a car can be like new but it does not help if you leave out the part that there is a transmission issue deception is particularly common within romantic relationships , with more than 90 % of individuals admitting to lying or not being completely honest with their partner at one time although other , less common , partner-focused motives such as using to deception to evoke jealous reactions from their partner may have damaging effects on a relationship in general , discovery of deception can result in a decrease in relationship satisfaction and commitment level , however , in instances where a person is successfully deceived , relationship satisfaction can actually be positively impacted for the person deceived , since lies are typically used to make the other partner feel more positive about the relationship in comparison , deception is more likely to occur in casual relationships and in dating where commitment level and length of acquaintanceship is often much lower when it comes to the occurrence of infidelity , there are many individual difference factors that can impact this behavior those individuals that show a higher level of executive control can more easily influence/control their thoughts and behaviors in relation to potential threats to an ongoing relationship which can result in paying less attention to threats to the current relationship ( other potential romantic mates ) research conducted by conley and colleagues ( 2011 ) suggests that the reasoning behind these gender differences stems from the negative stigma associated with women who engage in casual sex and inferences about the sexual capability of the potential sexual partner research on the use of deception in online dating has shown that people are generally truthful about themselves with the exception of physical attributes to appear more attractive in reality the study looked at the participants ' willingness to obey commands , even when that involved inflicting pain upon another person after the study , the subjects were informed of the true nature of the study , and steps were taken in order to ensure that the subjects left in a state of well-being psychological research often needs to deceive the subjects as to its actual purpose the rationale for such deception is that humans are sensitive to how they appear to others ( and to themselves ) and this self-consciousness might interfere with or distort from how they actually behave outside of a research context ( where they would not feel they were being scrutinized ) for example , if a psychologist is interested in learning the conditions under which students cheat on tests , directly asking them , '' how often do you cheat ? , '' might result in a high percent of '' socially desirable '' answers and the researcher would , in any case , be unable to verify the accuracy of these responses in general , then , when it is unfeasible or naive to simply ask people directly why or how often they do what they do , researchers turn to the use of deception to distract their participants from the true behavior of interest at the conclusion of this or any research involving deception , all participants must be told of the true nature of the study and why deception was necessary ( this is called debriefing ) though commonly used and allowed by the ethical guidelines of the american psychological association , there has been debate about whether or not the use of deception should be permitted in psychological research experiments however , because of its very nature , a researcher conducting a deception experiment can not reveal its true purpose to the subject , thereby making any consent given by a subject misinformed ( p baumrind ( 1964 ) , criticizing the use of deception in the milgram experiment , argues that deception experiments inappropriately take advantage of the implicit trust and obedience given by the subject when the subject volunteers to participate ( p those who do not object to the use of deception note that there is always a constant struggle in balancing '' the need for conducting research that may solve social problems and the necessity for preserving the dignity and rights of the research participant '' ( christensen , 1988 , p they also note that , in some cases , using deception is the only way to obtain certain kinds of information , and that prohibiting all deception in research would '' have the egregious consequence of preventing researchers from carrying out a wide range of important studies '' ( kimmel , 1998 , p lastly , it has also been suggested that an unpleasant treatment used in a deception study or the unpleasant implications of the outcome of a deception study may be the underlying reason that a study using deception is perceived as unethical in nature , rather than the actual deception itself ( broder , 1998 , p the notion was used as part of his hyperbolic doubt , wherein one decides to doubt everything there is to doubt
