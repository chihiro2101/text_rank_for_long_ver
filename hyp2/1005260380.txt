while these do not refer to the same thing , general circulation models are typically the tools used for climate model , and hence the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably however , the term '' global climate model '' is ambiguous and may refer to an integrated framework that incorporates multiple components including a general circulation model , or may refer to the general class of climate models that use a variety of means to represent the climate mathematically with the addition of submodels such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration over land , aogcms become the basis for a full climate model a simple general circulation model ( sgcm ) consists of a dynamic core that relates properties such as temperature to others such as pressure and velocity such models may be used to study atmospheric processes , but are not suitable for climate projections while the simpler models are generally susceptible to analysis and their results are easier to understand , aogcms may be nearly as hard to analyse as the climate itself this would lead to computational instabilities ( see cfl condition ) and so the model variables must be filtered along lines of latitude close to the poles some early versions of aogcms required an ad hoc process of '' flux correction '' to achieve a stable climate this resulted from separately prepared ocean and atmospheric models that each used an implicit flux from the other component different than that component could produce the model improvements that now make flux corrections unnecessary include improved ocean physics , improved resolution in both atmosphere and ocean , and more physically consistent coupling between atmosphere and ocean submodels improved models now maintain stable , multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate projections convection occurs on too small a scale to be resolved by climate models , and hence it must be handled via parameters clouds are also typically handled with a parameter , for a similar lack of scale the 2001 ipcc third assessment report f igure 9.3 shows the global mean response of 19 different coupled models to an idealised experiment in which emissions increased at 1 % per year human ghg emissions are a model input , although it is possible to include an economic/technological submodel to provide these as well atmospheric ghg levels are usually supplied as an input , though it is possible to include a carbon cycle model that reflects vegetation and oceanic processes to calculate such levels over the same time period , the '' likely '' range ( greater than 66 % probability , based on expert judgement ) for these scenarios was for a global mean temperature increase of 1.1 to 6.4 & nbsp ; °c , in in 2008 a study made climate projections using several emission scenarios they may be coupled to models of other processes in earth system models , such as the carbon cycle , so as to better model feedbacks most recent simulations show '' plausible '' agreement with the measured temperature anomalies over the past 150 years , when driven by observed changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols gcms are capable of reproducing the general features of the observed global temperature over the past century climate researchers around the world use climate models to understand the climate system the ipcc 's ipcc ar5 asserted '' very high confidence that models reproduce the general features of the global-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over the historical period '' however , the report also observed that the rate of warming over the period 1998–2012 was lower than that predicted by 111 out of 114 coupled model intercomparison project climate models the global climate models used for climate projections are similar in structure to ( and often share computer code with ) numerical weather prediction , but are nonetheless logically distinct however , because weather forecasts only cover around 10 days the models can also be run at higher vertical and horizontal resolutions than climate mode often local models are run using global model results for boundary conditions , to achieve higher local resolution : for example , the met office runs a mesoscale model with an resolution covering the uk , and various agencies in the us employ models such as the ngm and nam models spectral models are often used for global models because some computations in modeling can be performed faster , thus reducing run times , climate change 2007 chapter 10 : global climate projections , in ( pb : three ( or more properly , four since time is also considered ) dimensional gcm 's discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time models range in complexity : a simple radiant heat transfer model treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy this can be expanded vertically ( radiative-convective models ) , or horizontally finally , ( coupled ) atmosphere–ocean–sea ice global climate models discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange chemistry-climate models allow the effects of climate change on the ozone hole to be studied
