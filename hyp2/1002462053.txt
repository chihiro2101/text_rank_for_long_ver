throughout the first two parts , almost everything is seen through the eye of the camera ( designated in the script as e ) , although there are occasional moments when o 's perception is seen in the third part , much more of o 's perception of the room and its contents is given ” when the rushes of the first frenetic day ’ s outdoor filming were viewed , it was clear that it had been an almost total disaster … yet the budget did not allow for the scene to be reshot … hours were spent getting the exact close-up that they required of buster keaton ’ s ‘ creased , reptilian ’ eye to replace the abandoned outdoor scene with the extras it is summer , though it is hard to tell “ i had n't thought of that , ” the author admitted and then proposed , “ the same coat , ” which appealed to both men the couple look at each other and the man “ opens his mouth to vituperate ” beckett , s together they turn to stare directly at e as an open-mouthed expression takes over their faces ; they can not bear to look at what they have seen and turn their faces away as soon as he becomes aware of e 's presence he rushes down a couple of steps and cowers beside the wall until the camera retreats a little the expression on her face changes to the one of wide-eyed horror that was displayed on the faces of the man and woman outside he looks around to see if there is anyone about in his manuscript notes beckett had not envisioned these ‘ eye ’ holes but had written “ make chair back memorable ” and foresaw an “ upright back , intersecting wooden bars or lozenges ” o takes the folder from his case and goes to open it , but there are “ two eyelets , well proportioned ” ;

e is also the camera and , through the camera , the eye of the spectator as well but e is also self , not merely o ’ s self but the self of any person or people , specifically that of the other characters — the elderly couple and the flower-lady — who respond to its stare with that look of horror , theatre of shadows : samuel beckett ’ s drama 1956-1976 ( gerrards cross : colin smythe , 1988 ) , p 128 o does everything physically possible to avoid being seen by others , but the only thing he can do to avoid perception by an “ all seeing god ” is to tear up his picture , a symbolic act , as if saying , “ if i don ’ t believe you exist you can ’ t see me ” there is no one there to see him for what he really is other than himself and so , in this godless world , it is only fitting that e , representing o 's self-perception , would appear standing where the picture has been torn from the wall , filming beckett ’ s television plays : a director ’ s experience ( lewisburg : bucknell university press , 1992 ) , p 53 if beckett were shakespeare he might well have written : “ to be seen or not to be seen , that is the question , waiting for godot ( london : faber and faber , 1956 1988 ) , p 52 but what happens when you are alone ? the narrator of the unnamable answers : “ they depart , one by one , and the voices go on , it ’ s not theirs , they were never there , there was never anyone but you , talking to you about you… ” beckett , s , the unnamable ( new york : grove press , 1954 ) , p 34 the old woman in rockaby appears to be the exact opposite of o but although she actively seeks to be seen by someone while o does everything to avoid perceivedness , the irony is that both characters are alone with only themselves for company 662 the final scene in film is also comparable to the moment in the library when the old man in that time sees his own reflection in the glass covering a painting it could be tempting to think of o and e as a beckettian dr jekyll and mr hyde – indeed in notes for the first draft beckett did toy “ with the idea of making ‘ e tall ’ and ‘ o short ( and ) fat ’ which corresponds with the dual physique of jekyll and hyde ” – but film is not concerned with representations of good and evil , only with the concept of the second self , of pursuer and pursued , collected shorter plays of samuel beckett ( london : faber and faber , 1984 ) , p 163 beckett takes the emphasis away from berkeley 's maxim thus stressing the dramatic structure of the work beckett had never seen schneider direct any of his plays and yet continued to entrust him with the work “ it has even been suggested that the inspiration for waiting for godot might have come from a minor keaton film called the lovable cheat in which keaton plays a man who waits endlessly for the return of his partner - whose name was godot , ‘ film by samuel beckett ’ in filmwest 20 , 1995 , pp 22-24 “ when schneider managed to hunt up keaton , he found that genius of the silent screen — old , broke , ill , and alone — some 2 million ahead in a four-handed poker game with an imaginary louis b “ ‘ yes , i accept the offer , ’ were silent keaton 's unexpected first words to schneider 18 , issue 52 , 2006 from this one might think that keaton jumped at the chance but this is not the case presumably this went a long way to make him think twice about this new project i doubt if he ever read the text according to schneider , he had , prior to their initial meeting but “ was not sure what could be done to fix it up ” but he agreed to do it and he was very competent … of course , i had seen his silent films and enjoyed them – do n't suppose i could remember them now ” schneider 's recollection of that awkward first meeting confirms all of this and more : “ they simply had nothing to say to each other , no worlds of any kind to share he encouraged schneider to give him vocal directions during the shot , sometimes starting over again without stopping the camera if he felt he had n't done something well the first time '' keaton 's negative comments about the film are often reported but this final recollection by schneider may redress the balance : “ whatever he may have subsequently said to interviewers or reporters about not understanding a moment of what he was doing or what the film was about , what i remember best of our final farewell on the set was that he smiled and half-admitted those six pages were worth doing after all ” in february 1965 , when on a trip to west berlin , “ in deference to his recent work with buster keaton , he went to see keaton again in his 1927 film the general , finding it , however , disappointing
