on 1 july 1908 , the two forests were joined , and the combined forest area encompassed most of southeast alaska after the creation of the tongass national forest , the central council of the tlingit and haida indian tribes of alaska formed to challenge the federal government 's rights to the land in 1935 united states , the court found alaskan natives held established aboriginal title by their '' exclusive use and occupancy of that territory from time immemorial '' the court found the alaska purchase between russia and the united states did not extinguish aboriginal title to the land , and that the creation of the tongass national forest constituted a taking of land from the tlingit and haida timber harvest in southeast alaska consisted of individual handlogging operations up until the 1950s , focusing on lowlying areas and beach fringe areas the battle for buffer strips , to protect salmon streams from logging , which began in the zieske v butz lawsuit , continued through comments submitted to the major us forest service environmental impact statements issued in subsequent 5-year intervals starting in 1979 , and continuing in the 1988 eis finally , in 1990 , a federal district court in alaska , in a case called stein v barton , held the us forest service had to protect all salmon streams in the tongass with buffer strips one of the claims in stein v barton for protection of the salmon bay watershed was partially enacted into law when congress passed the tongass timber reform act ; however environmental lobbyists compromised with senator ted stevens leaving the most valuable forest available to logging in the headwaters of the salmon streams therein the law 's provisions cancelled a 40 & nbsp ; million annual subsidy for timber harvest ; established several new wilderness areas and closed others to logging ; and required that future cutting under the 50-year pulp contracts be subject to environmental review and limitations on old-growth harvest given the guaranteed low prices during contract days and the continued high cost of logging in southeast alaska today , one analysis concludes that , since 1980 , the forest service has lost over one billion dollars in tongass timber sales the forest service likens the overall deficit of the timber harvest program to the many other programs the agency operates at a deficit , including trail , cabin , and campground maintenance and subsistence programs as of 2008 , the forest service has released a new amendment to the forest plan for the tongass forest the road system that exists in the region is in place because of the resource extraction history in the region , primarily established by the forest service to enable timber harvest however , installing roads in the vast wilderness areas of the tongass is also a point of controversy for many in the american public , as reflected in the roadless area conservation movement , which has opposed further road construction on the grounds that it would promote habitat fragmentation , diminish wildlife populations and damage salmon spawning streams the tongass national forest was included in the roadless initiative passed on 5 january 2001 , during the last days of the bill clinton administration , and the initiative prevented the construction of new roads in currently roadless areas of united states national forests proponents of the amendment said that the federal timber program in tongass is a dead loss for taxpayers , costing some 30 & nbsp ; million annually , and noted that the forest service faces an estimated 900 & nbsp ; million road maintenance backlog in the forest '' in july 2009 , the obama administration approved clearcut logging on in the remaining old growth forests of a tongass national forest roadless area court , anchorage ) , 4 march 2011 reinstated the roadless rule on roadless areas in the tongass , but with three of the forest service 's recent timber projects excluded from that ruling '' without prejudice trump 's forest service removed most of the tongass national forest from roadless area designation in october 2020 , allowing road construction and logging in more than 9.3 & nbsp ; million acres of rainforest forest service as the '' crown jewel '' , the tongass stretches across 17 & nbsp ; million acres of land and is alaska 's largest national forest given the high value of these areas for wildlife species , close to 70 % of this old growth forest is protected in reserves and will never be eligible for harvest they contain over of territory , national wilderness areas by state , 14 november 2008 , united states forest service also more than any other of those lands were hand-picked old growth areas of the tongass national forest and are still surrounded by public national forest land transference of public national forest land to a privately owned corporation removes it from protection by federal law and allows the owners to use the land in whatever way they see fit without regard to the effects of the use on surrounding lands and ecosystems currently sealaska , a native regional corporation created under the ancsa is asking for an amendment to the act that would distribute additional land to alaskan natives when sealaska was created , it was promised additional land that was unavailable at the time due to contracts with pulp mills ; much of this original land is now under water or in a watershed , and consequently sealaska has requested different land known as the sealaska lands bill , the removal of 91,000 acres from the regulatory protections of the usfs and transfer of the land to sealaska , a for profit corporation , created a huge controversy in south east alaska a study released by audubon alaska on 22 february 2012 showed that the sealaska selection of the largest trees in areas designated in s 730 and hr 1408 is 1200 percent greater than the occurrence of these trees in the tongass as a whole there is strong opposition to passage of s 881 coming from seven communities in the tongass , most on prince of wales island
