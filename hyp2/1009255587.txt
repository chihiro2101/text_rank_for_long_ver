advancements in metallurgy throughout the early 20th century saw the introduction of tubular steel water pipes ( instead of timber poles ) with standardized dimensions , allowing for the industrial interchangeable parts and improving the structural stability of the scaffold the use of diagonal bracings also helped to improve stability , especially on tall buildings with one basic 24 pound unit a scaffold of various sizes and heights could be assembled easily by a couple of labourers without the nuts or bolts previously needed the chief difference between the two types of metal tubes is the lower weight of aluminium tubes ( 1.7 & nbsp ; kg/m as opposed to 4.4 & nbsp ; kg/m ) boards provide a working surface for scaffold users the board ends are protected either by metal plates called hoop irons or sometimes nail plates , which often have the company name stamped into them in addition to the boards for the working platform , there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect , although ordinary boards can also be used another solution , called a scaffpad , is made from a rubber base with a base plate moulded inside ; these are desirable for use on uneven ground since they adapt , whereas sole boards may split and have to be replaced despite the metric measurements given , many scaffolders measure tubes and boards in imperial units , with tubes from 21 feet down and boards from 13 & nbsp ; ft down the standards , also called uprights , are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire weight of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square base plate to spread the load main transoms are placed next to the standards , they hold the standards in place and provide support for boards ; intermediate transoms are those placed between the main transoms to provide extra support for boards '' american '' has the transoms attached to the standards and is used less but has certain advantages in some situations to limit sway a facade brace is fitted to the face of the scaffold every 30 metres or so at an angle of 35°-55° running right from the base to the top of the scaffold and fixed at every level more heavy-duty scaffolding can require 5 , 6 or even up to 8 boards width often an inside board is added to reduce the gap between the inner standard and the structure often scaffold frameworks will require more than simple base plates to safely carry and spread the load scaffolding can be used without base plates on concrete or similar hard surfaces , although base plates are always recommended for softer or more doubtful surfaces sole boards must be used , beneath a single standard a sole board should be at least with no dimension less than , the thickness must be at least on uneven ground steps must be cut for the base plates , a minimum step size of around is recommended to provide stability for a scaffolding ( at left ) framework ties are generally fixed to the adjacent building/fabric/steelwork general practice is to attach a tie every 4 m on alternate lifts ( traditional scaffolding ) 2–3 m centres ( tie patterns must be provided by the system manufacturer/supplier ) box ties are used to attach the scaffold to suitable pillars or comparable features two additional transoms are put across from the lift on each side of the feature and are joined on both sides with shorter tubes called tie tubes when a complete box tie is impossible a l-shaped lip tie can be used to hook the scaffold to the structure , to limit inward movement an additional transom , a butt transom , is placed hard against the outside face of the structure sometimes it is possible to use anchor ties ( also called bolt ties ) , these are ties fitted into holes drilled in the structure these use an opening in the structure but use a tube wedged horizontally in the opening the reveal tube is usually held in place by a reveal screw pin ( an adjustable threaded bar ) and protective packing at either end bamboo scaffolding is a type of scaffolding made from bamboo and widely used in construction work for centuries many famous landmarks , notably the great wall of china , were built using bamboo scaffolding , and its use continues today in some parts of the world forms of bamboo scaffolding include : double-row scaffold only double-row bamboo scaffold is allowed to be used for working at height steel bracket steel brackets shall be provided for supporting the standard of scaffold at about six floor intervals putlogs mild steel bars or similar materials are required to tie any structure to maintain the bamboo scaffold in its position on every floor working platform every working platform must be at least 400 & nbsp ; mm wide and closely boarded by planks trained worker they should complete formal training in bamboo scaffolding work or hold a trade test certificate on bamboo scaffolding and have at least 3 years of relevant experience the flexibility and convenience of this type of scaffolding suits stages set up for temporary use and also separates the audience from the performers this feature allows the end of the tube to be inserted into or rest upon the brickwork of the structure in recent years a number of new innovations have meant an increased scope of use for scaffolding , such as ladderbeams for spanning spaces that can not accommodate standards and the increased use of sheeting and structure to create temporary roofs putlog tubes can also be used vertically when drove under downward pressure into the ground , most typically in greens and fields , where approx 1/4 of the putlog tube remains exposed above ground the purpose for this alternative method is to create a good anchoring point for additional vertical scaffolding to clamp on to , most commonly used in live events and festivals with scaffolding poles upto 21foot in height where festoon lighting , cabling and bunting can be hung from safely rolling platforms typically wide by long and tall sections which can be stacked up to three high with the use of added outriggers among the standards there are : din 4420 , a din standard divided in 5 parts which covers the design and detail of scaffolds , ladder scaffolds , safety requirements and standard types , materials , components , dimensions and loadbearing capacity
