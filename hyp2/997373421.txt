a case consists of a problem , its solution , and , typically , annotations about how the solution was derived reuse : map the solution from the previous case to the target problem this may involve adapting the solution as needed to fit the new situation revise : having mapped the previous solution to the target situation , test the new solution in the real world ( or a simulation ) and , if necessary , revise retain : after the solution has been successfully adapted to the target problem , store the resulting experience as a new case in memory at first glance , cbr may seem similar to the rule induction algorithms rule-induction algorithms are procedures for learning rules for a given concept by generalizing from examples of that concept like a rule-induction algorithm , cbr starts with a set of cases or training examples ; it forms generalizations of these examples , albeit implicit ones , by identifying commonalities between a retrieved case and the target problem a rule-induction algorithm draws its generalizations from a set of training examples before the target problem is even known ; that is , it performs eager generalization while cbr in law and cognitively inspired cbr have long been associated , the former is more clearly an interpolation of rule based reasoning , and judgment , while the latter is more closely tied to recall and process adaptation there is recent work that develops cbr within a statistical framework and formalizes case-based inference as a specific type of probabilistic inference ; thus , it becomes possible to produce case-based predictions equipped with a certain level of confidence schank 's model of dynamic memory roger schank , dynamic memory : a theory of learning in computers and people ( new york : cambridge university press , 1982 ) other schools of cbr and closely allied fields emerged in the 1980s , which directed at topics such as legal reasoning , memory-based reasoning ( a way of reasoning from examples on massively parallel machines ) , and combinations of cbr with other reasoning methods cbr technology has resulted in the deployment of a number of successful systems , the earliest being lockheed 's clavier , bill mark , '' case-based reasoning for autoclave management , '' proceedings of the case-based reasoning workshop ( 1989 ) cbr has been used extensively in help desk applications such as the compaq smart system trung nguyen , mary czerwinski , and dan lee , '' compaq quicksource : providing the consumer with the power of artificial intelligence , '' in proceedings of the fifth annual conference on innovative applications of artificial intelligence ( washington , dc : aaai press , 1993 ) , 142-151 case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the first international conference on case-based reasoning
