293 writs of instruction continued to develop under his immediate successors , but it was not until henry the second that writs became available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice , thus initiating a vast expansion in their role within the common law the development of writs as a means of commencing a court action was a form of '' off-the-shelf '' justice designed to enable the english law courts to rapidly process lawsuits by allocating each form of complaint into a standard category which could be dealt with by standard procedures the previous system of justice at the royal court of chancery was tailor-made to suit each case and was thus highly time-consuming thus eventually the obtaining of a writ became necessary , in most cases , to have a case heard in one of the royal courts , such as the king 's bench or common pleas initially , for common law , recourse to the king 's courts was unusual , and something for which a plaintiff would have to pay for most royal courts , the writ would usually have been purchased from the chancery , although the court of the exchequer , being , in essence , another government department , was able to issue its own writs moreover , a writ , if one could be found fitting the plaintiff 's case , provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the local court , often controlled by a lesser noble , and instead have it heard by the king 's judges new writs were created after that time only by the express sanction of parliament and the forms of writ remained essentially static , each writ defining a particular form of action a writ was a summons from the crown , to the parties to the action , with on its back the substance of the action set out , together with a 'prayer ' requesting a remedy from the court ( for example damages ) 1716 ) discussed in house of lords in 1980 , writs applied to claims that were to be heard in one of the courts which eventually formed part of the high court of justice under these , almost all civil actions , other than those connected with insolvency , are now commenced by the completion of a 'claim form ' as opposed to the obtaining of a 'writ ' , 'originating application ' , or 'summons ' ( see rules 7 and 8 of the civil procedure rules ) this phrase derives from the fact that to hold an election in such a system a writ of election must be issued on behalf of the monarch ordering the high sheriffs of each county to set in motion the procedure for elections early law of the united states inherited the traditional english writ system , in the sense of a rigid set of forms of relief that the law courts were authorized to grant '' however , the federal rules of civil procedure , adopted in 1938 to govern civil procedure in the united states district courts , provide that there is only one form of action in civil cases , and explicitly abolish certain writs by name in the united states federal courts , the writ is most often used to review the constitutionality of criminal convictions rendered by state courts in extraordinary circumstances , the united states court of appeals can use the common law writ of prohibition under the all writs act to control proceedings in the district courts some courts have held that in rare circumstances in a federal criminal case , a united states district court may use the common law writ of error coram nobis under the all writs act to set aside a conviction when no other remedy is available in an attempt to purge latin from the language of the law , california law has for many years used the term writ of mandate in place of writ of mandamus , and writ of review in place of writ of certiorari the due process for petitions for such writs is not simply civil or criminal , because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority , so that the official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something , failing which the court has no discretion but to decide for the petitioner , who may be any person , not just an interested party the supreme court , the highest in the country , may issue writs under article 32 of the constitution for enforcement of fundamental rights and under article 139 for enforcement of rights other than fundamental rights , while high courts , the superior courts of the states , may issue writs under articles 226 the writ of certiorari ( be informed ) is issued to a lower court directing that the record of a case be sent up for review , together with all supporting files , evidence , and documents , usually with the intention of overruling the judgment of the lower court
