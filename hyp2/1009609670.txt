randomization is the process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce the bias '' although subjects almost always provide informed consent for their participation in an rct , studies since 1982 have documented that rct subjects may believe that they are certain to receive treatment that is best for them personally ; that is , they do not understand the difference between research and treatment the rct method variations may also create cultural effects that have not been well understood '' explanatory rcts test efficacy in a research setting with highly selected participants and under highly controlled conditions some rcts are noninferiority trials '' to determine whether a new treatment is no worse than a reference treatment '' a second and more practical issue is allocation concealment , which refers to the stringent precautions taken to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups the risk of selection bias is highest when previous treatment assignments are known ( as in unblinded studies ) or can be guessed ( perhaps if a drug has distinctive side effects ) however , no single randomization procedure meets those goals in every circumstance , so researchers must select a procedure for a given study based on its advantages and disadvantages '' minimization is reported to have '' supporters and detractors '' because only the first subject 's group assignment is truly chosen at random , the method does not necessarily eliminate bias on unknown factors response-adaptive randomization , also known as outcome-adaptive randomization : the probability of being assigned to a group increases if the responses of the prior patients in the group were favorable although arguments have been made that this approach is more ethical than other types of randomization when the probability that a treatment is effective or ineffective increases during the course of an rct , ethicists have not yet studied the approach in detail treatment related side-effects or adverse events may be specific enough to reveal allocation to investigators or patients thereby introducing bias or influencing any subjective parameters collected by investigators or requested from subjects if the effect of the treatment is small , the number of treatment units in either group may be insufficient for rejecting the null hypothesis in the respective statistical test the 2010 consort statement specifies that authors and editors should not use the terms '' single-blind '' , '' double-blind '' , and '' triple-blind '' ; instead , reports of blinded rct should discuss '' if done , who was blinded after assignment to interventions ( for example , participants , care providers , those assessing outcomes ) and how in pragmatic rcts , although the participants and providers are often unblinded , it is '' still desirable and often possible to blind the assessor or obtain an objective source of data for evaluation of outcomes regardless of the statistical methods used , important considerations in the analysis of rct data include : whether an rct should be stopped early due to interim results for example , rcts may be stopped early if an intervention produces '' larger than expected benefit or harm '' , or if '' investigators find evidence of no important difference between experimental and control interventions a '' pure '' intention-to-treat analysis is '' possible only when complete outcome data are available '' for all randomized subjects ; when some outcome data are missing , options include analyzing only cases with known outcomes and using imputed data nevertheless , the more that analyses can include all participants in the groups to which they were randomized , the less bias that an rct will be subject to the authors of the 2000 findings questioned the belief that '' observational studies should not be used for defining evidence-based medical care '' and that rcts ' results are '' evidence of the highest grade '' however , a 2001 study published in journal of the american medical association concluded that '' discrepancies beyond chance do occur and differences in estimated magnitude of treatment effect are very common '' between observational studies and rcts two other lines of reasoning question rcts ' contribution to scientific knowledge beyond other types of studies : if study designs are ranked by their potential for new discoveries , then anecdotal evidence would be at the top of the list , followed by observational studies , followed by rcts , 1 in 20 ) as the probability that the rct will falsely find two equally effective treatments significantly different reviewers examine the study results for potential problems with design that could lead to unreliable results ( for example by creating a systematic bias ) , evaluate the study in the context of related studies and other evidence , and evaluate whether the study can be reasonably considered to have proven its conclusions results of rcts may be combined in systematic reviews which are increasingly being used in the conduct of evidence-based practice some examples of scientific organizations ' considering rcts or systematic reviews of rcts to be the highest-quality evidence available are : as of 1998 , the national health and medical research council of australia designated '' level i '' evidence as that '' obtained from a systematic review of all relevant randomised controlled trials '' and '' level ii '' evidence as that '' obtained from at least one properly designed randomised controlled trial '' since at least 2001 , in making clinical practice guideline recommendations the united states preventive services task force has considered both a study 's design and its internal validity as indicators of its quality the grade working group concluded in 2008 that '' randomised trials without important limitations constitute high quality evidence '' for issues involving '' therapy/prevention , aetiology/harm '' , the oxford centre for evidence-based medicine as of 2011 defined '' level 1a '' evidence as a systematic review of rcts that are consistent with each other , and '' level 1b '' evidence as an '' individual rct ( with narrow confidence interval ) the conduct of an rct takes several years until being published ; thus , data is restricted from the medical community for long years and may be of less relevance at time of publication , a rare side effect of a drug ) would require rcts with extremely large sample sizes and may , therefore , best be assessed by observational studies due to the costs of running rcts , these usually only inspect one variable or very few variables , rarely reflecting the full picture of a complicated medical situation ; whereas the case report , for example , can detail many aspects of the patient 's medical situation ( e.g a 2011 study done to disclose possible conflicts of interests in underlying research studies used for medical meta-analyses reviewed 29 meta-analyses and found that conflicts of interests in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed if a disruptive innovation in medical technology is developed , it may be difficult to test this ethically in an rct if it becomes '' obvious '' that the control subjects have poorer outcomes—either due to other foregoing testing , or within the initial phase of the rct itself historical control trials ( hct ) exploit the data of previous rcts to reduce the sample size ; however , these approaches are controversial in the scientific community and must be handled with care some writers from a medical or health background have argued that existing research in a range of social science disciplines lacks rigour , and should be improved by greater use of randomized control trials researchers in transport science argue that public spending on programmes such as school travel plans could not be justified unless their efficacy is demonstrated by randomized controlled trials they concluded that most of the studies were of low quality and advocated the use of randomized controlled trials wherever possible in future transport research he proposed the following eight criteria for the use of rcts in contexts where interventions must change human behaviour to be effective : the intervention : has not been applied to all members of a unique group of people ( e.g ) is applied in a context or setting similar to that which applies to the control group can be isolated from other activities—and the purpose of the study is to assess this isolated effect has a short timescale between its implementation and maturity of its effects and the causal mechanisms : are either known to the researchers , or else all possible alternatives can be tested do not involve significant feedback mechanisms between the intervention group and external environments have a stable and predictable relationship to exogenous factors would act in the same way if the control group and intervention group were reversed these include the '' unique time period assessment bias '' , the '' background traits remain constant assumption '' , the '' average treatment effects limitation '' , the '' simple treatment at the individual level limitation '' , the '' all preconditions are fully met assumption '' , the '' quantitative variable limitation '' and the '' placebo only or conventional treatment only limitation '' .
