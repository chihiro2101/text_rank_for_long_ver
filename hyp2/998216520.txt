some early tracker-like programs appeared for the msx ( yamaha cx5m ) and commodore 64 , before 1987 , such as sound monitor , but these did not feature sample playback , instead playing notes on the computer 's internal synthesizer later , programs like rock monitor also supported additional sample playback , usually with short drum samples loaded in ram memory the first trackers supported four pitch and volume modulated channels of 8-bit pcm samples , a limitation derived from the amiga 's paula audio chipset and the commonplace 8svx format used to store sampled sound another sound card popular on the pc tracker scene was the gravis ultrasound , which continued the hardware mixing tradition , with 32 internal channels and onboard memory for sample storage the responsibility for audio mixing passed from hardware to software ( the main cpu ) which gradually enabled the use of more channels there was also a split off from the sample based trackers taking advantage of the opl2 and opl3 chips of the sound blaster series all sound tracker was able to combine both the fm synthesis of the opl chips and the sample based synthesis of the emu-8000 chips in the sound blaster awe series of cards as well as midi output to any additional hardware of choice there are several elements common to any tracker program : samples , notes , effects , tracks ( or channels ) , patterns , and orders whereas the original amiga trackers only provided four tracks , the hardware limit , modern trackers can mix a virtually unlimited number of channels into one sound stream through software mixing some modern trackers simulate polyphony in a single track by setting the '' new note action '' of each instrument to cut , continue , fade out , or release , opening new mixing channels as necessary many of these formats can also be imported into existing trackers , allowing to view arrangement , instrumentation and the use of effect commands this also makes the self-teaching of music composition using trackers easier and allows to extract instruments for later use in own songs , which was very common .
