in contrast to typical words and sentences , the function of most interjections is related to an expression of feeling , rather than representing some idea or concept emotion review , 6 ( 1 ) , 53-63 generally , interjections can be classified into three types of meaning : volitive , emotive , or cognitive a common distinction is based on relations to other word categories : primary interjections are interjections first and foremost ( examples : oops although secondary interjections tend to interact more with the words around them , a characteristic of all interjections—whether primary or secondary—is that they can stand alone for example , it is possible to utter an interjection like ouch ! or bloody hell ! on its own , whereas a different part of speech that may seem similar in function and length , such as the conjunction and , can not be uttered alone ( you ca n't just say and ! independently in english ) the main thing these word types share is that they can occur on their own and do not easily undergo inflection , but they are otherwise divergent in several ways interjections can also be confused with adverbs when they appear following a form of the verb “ go ” ( as in '' he went 'ouch ! ' '' ) , which may seem to describe a manner of going ( compare : 'he went rapidly ' ) however , this is only a superficial similarity , as the verb go in the first example does not describe the action of going somewhere interjections , on the other hand , can stand alone and also are always preceded by a pause , separating them from the grammar and syntax of other surrounding utterances interjections are bound by context , meaning that their interpretation is largely dependent on the time and place at which they are uttered similar observations have been made for the interjections oh ! ' ( meaning , roughly , '' now i see '' ) and ' mm/m-hm ' ( with the meaning '' keep talking , i 'm with you '' ) across languages , interjections often use special sounds and syllable types that are not commonly used in other parts of the vocabulary for instance , interjections like ' brr ' and ' shh ! ' are made entirely of consonants , where in virtually all languages , words have to feature at least one vowel-like element the phonetic atypicality of some interjections is one reason they have traditionally been considered as lying outside the realm of language several english interjections contain sounds , or are sounds as opposed to words , that do not ( or very rarely ) exist in regular english phonology inventory
