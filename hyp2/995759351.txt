germany 's hugo junkers patented his own wing-only air transport concept in 1910 , seeing it as a natural solution to the problem of building an airliner large enough to carry a reasonable passenger load and enough fuel to cross the atlantic in regular service he believed that the flying wing 's potentially large internal volume and low drag made it an obvious design for this role in 1919 he started work on his '' giant '' jg1 design , intended to seat passengers within a thick wing , but two years later the allied aeronautical commission of control ordered the incomplete jg1 destroyed for exceeding postwar size limits on german aircraft several other late-war german military designs were based on the flying wing concept , or variations of it , as a proposed solution to extend the range of otherwise very short-range of aircraft powered by early jet engines in the soviet union , the bich-26 , became one of the first attempts to produce a supersonic jet flying wing aircraft in 1948 ; '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b early proposals for the avro vulcan , a nuclear-armed strategic bomber designed by roy chadwick , also explored several flying wing arrangements ; alliott verdon roe official web site - avro vulcan sketch one such configuration examined for the vulcan paired the flying wing with a rudimentary forward fuselage and a vertical stabilizer at each wingtip ; the delta wing that was actually adopted was arrived at by reducing the wingspan while maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips following the arrival of supersonic aircraft during the 1950s , military interest in the flying wing was quickly curtailed , as the concept of adopting a thick wing that accommodated the crew and equipment directly conflicted with the optimal thin wing for supersonic flight stealth technology relies on shapes that reflect radar waves only in certain directions , thus making the aircraft hard to detect unless the radar receiver is at a specific position relative to the aircraftâ€”a position that changes continuously as the aircraft moves in this case , the aerodynamic advantages of the flying wing are not the primary reasons for the design 's adoption however , modern computer-controlled fly-by-wire systems allow for many of the aerodynamic drawbacks of the flying wing to be minimized , making for an efficient and effectively stable long-range bomber due to the practical need for a deep wing , the flying wing concept is most practical for subsonic aircraft there has been continual interest in using it in the large transport role where the wing is deep enough to hold cargo or passengers a number of companies , including boeing , mcdonnell douglas , and armstrong whitworth , have performed considerable design work on flying wing airliners to date , no such airliners have yet entered production as of 2020 a clean flying wing is sometimes presented as theoretically the most aerodynamics efficient ( lowest drag ) design configuration for a fixed wing aircraft further difficulties arise from the problem of fitting the pilot , engines , flight equipment , and payload all within the depth of the wing section other known problems with the flying wing design relate to pitch and yaw a wing that is made deep enough to contain the pilot , engines , fuel , undercarriage and other necessary equipment will have an increased frontal area , when compared with a conventional wing and long-thin fuselage any fin must attach directly on to the rear part of the wing , giving a small moment arm from the aerodynamic center , which in turn means that the fin is inefficient and to be effective the fin area must be large in some flying wing designs , any stabilizing fins and associated control rudders would be too far forward to have much effect , thus alternative means for yaw control are sometimes provided one solution to the control problem is differential drag : the drag near one wing tip is artificially increased , causing the aircraft to yaw in the direction of that wing this effect is generally accompanied by a loss of lift , which must be compensated for either by the pilot or by complex design features so flying wings are at their best when cruising in still air : in turbulent air or when changing course , the aircraft may be less efficient than a conventional design the supersonic bi-directional flying wing design comprises a long-span low speed wing and a short-span high speed wing joined in the form of an unequal cross some related aircraft that are not strictly flying wings have been described as such although sometimes referred to as flying wings , these types carry the pilot ( and engine where fitted ) below the wing structure rather than inside it , and so are not true flying wings an aircraft of sharply swept delta planform and deep center section represents a borderline case between flying wing , blended wing body , and/or lifting body configurations
