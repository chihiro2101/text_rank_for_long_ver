thumb most modern shopping carts are made of metal or a combination of metal and plastic and have been designed to nest within each other in a line to facilitate collecting and moving many at one time and also to save on storage space shopping carts are usually fitted with four wheels , however if any one wheel jams the cart can become difficult to handle small shops , where carts would be impractical , often supply only baskets , or may offer a small cart which uses an inserted shopping basket within the frame of the cart to provide either choice to a customer they advertised the invention as part of a new “ no basket carrying plan after hiring several male and female models to push his new invention around his store and demonstrate their utility , as well as greeters to explain their use , shopping carts became extremely popular and goldman became a multimillionaire in urban areas like new york city , where transporting groceries home from the store 's parking lot is more likely to involve walking and/or a trip by public transportation than a car ride , privately owned carts resembling goldman 's design are still popular goldman continued to make modifications to his original design , but advice from his trusted business partners fred taylor , a grocery store owner , and george o'donnell , a grocery store refrigeration salesman , and the incorporation of watson 's swinging door yielded the familiar nesting cart that we see today ( albeit the original telescope cart had two baskets rather than one ) child's-chair safety device - bessie decamp - patent 944,020 this was well before shopping carts with child seating areas were invented for whatever reason , it was n't until 1967 that seat belts for shopping carts were introduced by david allen , '' nesting '' ) shopping cart which did not require assembly or disassembly of its parts before and after use like goldman 's cart ; goldman 's design up until this point required that the cart be unfolded much like a folding chair the swinging rear door formed the basis of the patent claim , and was a major innovation in the evolution of the modern shopping cart watson applied for a patent on his shopping cart invention in 1946 , but goldman contested it and filed an application for a similar patent with the swinging door feature on a shopping cart with only one basket in 1948 which goldman named the '' nest-kart '' this included any shopping cart utilizing his hinged rear door , including the familiar single basket '' nesting '' designs similar to those used in the present owing to its overwhelming success , many different manufacturers desired to produce shopping carts with the rear swinging door feature but were denied due to the exclusive license issued to goldman licensed their telescoping shopping cart design to several manufacturers throughout the 1950s and 1960s until the patent expired past studies determined that retailers who did not offer shopping carts such as sears suffered lower sales in comparison to retailers who did use shopping carts shopping in the real world : interacting with a context-aware shopping trolley some retailers , such as target , have begun using carts fully made of recycled plastic with the only metal part being the wheel axles , drawing away from the established metal cart design other cart designs also incorporate additional features such as a cup holder for cold or hot drinks or a bouquet of flowers , along with other features such as a secure shelf for a tablet computer or mobile phone to allow the use of mobile coupons and circulars , or as seen in an all-plastic design created for the wisconsin-based festival foods and also used by whole foods market by bemis manufacturing company , all of these features , along with extra rungs on the side rail designed to attach plastic bags or carry handles for beverages smaller half-sized carts for smaller shopping trips have also become common in many countries , the customer has to pay a small deposit by inserting a coin , token or card , which is returned if and when the customer returns the cart to a designated cart parking point one motivation behind the deposit system is to reduce the expense of employees having to gather carts that are not returned , and to avoid damage done by runaway carts another benefit is that carts are less likely to be removed from the store premises and abandoned in the surrounding neighborhood one of the first store chains to use the 0.25 deposit system in the us was the real superstore ( a subsidiary of national supermarkets ) in the early 1990s national supermarkets cart collectors are also usually provided with a special key that they can use to unlock the carts from the cart bay and get the key back the carts , which typically cost between 75 and 150 each , with some models costing 300–400 , are removed by people for various purposes most retailers in north america utilize a cart retrieval service , which collects carts found off the store 's premises and returns them to the store for a fee the primary strength of this system is the ability of pedestrian customers to take purchases home and allow retailers to recapture abandoned carts in a timely manner at a fraction of the cost of a replacement cart often , a line is painted in front of the broadcast range to warn customers that their cart will stop when rolled past the line there are also safety concerns if the person pushing the trolley is running , and also if the trolley does n't lock and is taken onto a road , locking due to magnetic materials under the road a low-tech form of theft prevention utilizes a physical impediment , such as vertical posts at the store entrance to keep carts from being taken into the parking lot many customers learn to bring their own folding or otherwise collapsible cart with them , which they can usually hang on the store 's cart while shopping shopping cart–related injuries to children american academy of pediatrics paper on the history of the shopping cart the '' telescopic shopping cart collection '' at the national museum of american history ( smithsonian institution ) reversing the operation of caps shopping cart wheel locks defra guidance on the security of shopping trolleys
