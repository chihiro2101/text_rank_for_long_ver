william randolph hearst 's reporting on maine whipped up support for military action against the spanish in cuba regardless of their actual involvement in the sinking he frequently cited various naval officers saying that the explosion could not have been an on-board accident in the first place , such a thing has never occurred before that i have ever heard of either in the british navy or ours '' hearst 's sources never had to be specifically named because he just needed them to support the narrative that the explosion was caused by an attack by the spanish advocates of war used the rallying cry , '' remember the maine ! to hell with spain ! '' the spanishâ€“american war began on april 21 , 1898 , two months after the sinking all investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship , but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded additional observations included that : had a mine been the cause of the explosion , a column of water would have been observed the wind and the waters were calm on that date and hence a mine could not have been detonated by contact , but only by using electricity , but no cables had been found no dead fish were found in the harbor , as would be expected following an explosion in the water in order to find the cause of the explosion , a naval inquiry was ordered by the united states shortly after the incident , headed by captain william t the fact that the officer proposed to be court president was junior to the captain of maine , wegner writes , '' would indicate either ignorance of navy regulations or that , in the beginning , the board did not intend to examine the possibility that the ship was lost by accident and the negligence of her captain '' another inconsistency , according to wegner , was that of only one technical witness , commander george converse , from the torpedo station at newport , rhode island the board concluded that maine had been blown up by a mine , which , in turn , caused the explosion of her forward magazines they reached this conclusion based on the fact that the majority of witnesses stated that they had heard two explosions and that part of the keel was bent inwards besides the desire for a more thorough investigation , this would also facilitate the recovery of the bodies of the victims , so they could be buried in the united states the fact that the cuban government wanted the wreck removed from havana harbor might also have played a role : it at least offered the opportunity to examine the wreck in greater detail than had been possible in 1898 , while simultaneously obliging the now-independent cubans rickover became intrigued with the disaster and began a private investigation in 1974 , using information from the two official inquiries , newspapers , personal papers , and information on the construction and ammunition of maine navy '' made little use of its technically trained officers during its investigation of the tragedy wegner says that all relevant documents were obtained and studied , including the ship 's plans and weekly reports of the unwatering of maine in 1912 ( the progress of the cofferdam ) written by william furgueson , chief engineer for the project they concluded that the photos showed '' no plausible evidence of penetration from the outside , '' and they believed that the explosion originated inside the ship wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a coal bunker fire could have taken place and ignited the ship 's ammunition this investigation , done to commemorate the centennial of the sinking of uss maine , was based on computer modeling , a technique unavailable for previous investigations national geographic reported that '' a fire in the coal bunker could have generated sufficient heat to touch off an explosion in the adjacent magazine but on the other hand , computer analysis also shows that even a small , handmade mine could have penetrated the ship 's hull and set off explosions within '' the ame investigation noted that '' the size and location of the soil depression beneath the maine 'is more readily explained by a mine explosion than by magazine explosions alone ' '' it used photographic evidence , naval experts , and archival information to argue that the cause of the explosion was a coal bunker fire , and it identified a weakness or gap in the bulkhead separating the coal and powder bunkers that allowed the fire to spread from the former to the latter several claims have been made in spanish-speaking media that the sinking was a false flag operation conducted by the u.s operation northwoods was a series of proposals prepared by pentagon officials for the joint chiefs of staff in 1962 , setting out a number of proposed false flag operations that could be blamed on the cuban communists in order to rally support against them one of these suggested that a u.s for several years , the maine was left where she sank in havana harbor , but it was evident she would have to be removed sometime on 9 may 1910 , congress authorized funds for the removal of the maine , the proper interment in arlington national cemetery of the estimated 70 bodies still inside , and the removal and transport of the main mast to arlington congress did not demand a new investigation into the sinking at that time after lying on the bottom of havana harbor for fourteen years these pumps were found to be still operational , and were subsequently used to raise the ship on 13 february 1912 , the engineers let water back into the interior of the cofferdam three days later , the interior of the cofferdam was full and maine floated at 5pm local time , with a crowd of over 100,000 persons watching from the shore , her sea cocks were opened , and just over twenty minutes later , maine sank , bow first , in of water , to the sound of taps and the 21-gun salute of birmingham and north carolina during the salvage , remains of 66 more were found , of whom only one , harry j keys ( an engineering officer ) , was identified and returned to his home town ; the rest were reburied at arlington national cemetery , making a total of 229 buried there the ship had been discovered east of where it was believed it had been scuttled ; according to the researchers , during the sinking ceremony and the time it took the wreck to founder , currents pushed maine east until it came to rest at its present location before the team identified the site as maine , they referred to the location as the '' square '' due to its unique shape , and at first they did not believe it was the ship , due to its unexpected location nine bodies were never recovered and 19 crewmen , several unidentified , are buried in key west cemetery under a statue of a u.s in 1961 , the memorial was damaged by crowds , following the bay of pigs invasion , and the eagle on top was broken and removed in 1914 , one of maines six anchors was taken from the washington navy yard to city park in reading , pennsylvania , and dedicated during a ceremony presided over by franklin d a 6-pound deck gun from maine is at the white plains public works yard in white plains , new york , after being removed from battle whitney park one of the ship 's anchors was donated to the city of reading , pennsylvania
