they are sometimes described as an aloof breed , although it has been noted that they tend to be very loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people it has been suggested that the scottish terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers , although this is not always the case they have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age this condition has also been seen in other breeds of dog , such as the west highland white terrier , cairn terrier , boston terrier , as well as some larger breeds such as bullmastiffs the condition appears in most breeds to some extent , but other breeds with an increased risk include the golden retriever , german shepherd dog , basset hound and manchester terrier thumb initial grouping of several of the highland terriers ( including the scottie ) under the generic name skye terriers caused some confusion in the breed 's lineage there is disagreement over whether the skye terriers mentioned in early 16th century records actually descended from forerunners of the scottie or vice versa the first written records about a dog of similar description to the scottish terrier dates from 1436 , when don leslie described them in his book the history of scotland 1436–1561 many dog writers after the early 19th century seem to agree that there were two varieties of terrier existing in britain at the time—a rough-haired so-called scotch terrier and a smooth-haired english terrier thomas brown , in his biological sketches and authentic anecdotes of dogs ( 1829 ) , states that '' the scotch terrier is certainly the purest in point of breed and the ( smooth ) english seems to have been produced by a cross from him '' brown went on to describe the scotch terrier as '' low in stature , with a strong muscular body , short stout legs , a head large in proportion to the body '' and was '' generally of a sandy colour or black '' with a '' long , matted and hard '' coat although the scotch terrier described here is more generic than specific to a breed , it asserts the existence of a small , hard , rough-coated terrier developed for hunting small game in the scottish highlands in the early 19th century ; a description that shares characteristics with what was once known as the aberdeen terrier and is today known as the scottish terrier in addition , the paintings of sir edwin landseer and an 1835 lithograph entitled '' scottish terriers at work on a cairn in the west highlands '' both depict scottie type terriers very similar to those described in the first scottish terrier standard image : scottish terrier sire.jpg thumb left alt '' a greyscale photograph of a typical black scottish terrier facing off camera in profile to the lower left '' ch '' towards the end of the 19th century , it was decided to separate these scottish terriers and develop pure bloodlines and specific breeds the birmingham england dog show of 1860 was the first to offer classes for these groups of terriers they continued to be exhibited in generic groups for several years and these groups included the ancestors of today 's scottish terrier recorded history and the initial development of the breed started in the late 1870s with the development of dog shows the exhibition and judging of dogs required comparison to a breed standard and thus the appearance and temperament of the scottie was written down for the first time while fanciers sought to identify and standardize the breed and its description through the late 19th century , the scottish terrier was known by many different names : the highland , the cairn , diehard , and most often , the aberdeen terrier—named because of the abundant number of the dogs in the area and because a j it is often said that all present day scotties stem from a single bitch , splinter ii , and two sires '' cooke goes on to say '' for whatever reason , early breeders line bred on this bitch to the virtual exclusion of all others thomson gray and appeared in vero shaw 's illustrated book of the dog , published in 1880 ; it was extremely influential in setting both breed type and name following the formation of the english and scottish clubs there followed several years of disagreement regarding the breed 's official standard these four dogs and their offspring modified the look of the scottie , particularly the length of the head , closeness to the ground and the squareness of body their subsequent success in the show ring led to them becoming highly sought after by the british public and breeders the scottish terrier club of america ( stca ) was formed in 1900 and a standard written in 1925 scottish terriers have won best in show at the westminster kennel club dog show more than any other breed except for the wire fox terrier , a total of nine times the scottie and the german shepherd are the only breeds of dog that have lived in the white house more than three times when the game was first created in the 1930s , scotties were one of the most popular pets in the united states , and it is also one of the most popular monopoly game tokens , according to matt collins , vice president of marketing for hasbro
