early computers used core and drum memory systems which were non-volatile as a byproduct of their construction other memory types required constant power to retain data , such as vacuum tube or solid-state flip-flops , williams tubes , and semiconductor memory ( static or dynamic ram ) some drawbacks to flash memory include the requirement to write it in larger blocks than many computers can automatically address , and the relatively limited longevity of flash memory due to its finite number of write-erase cycles ( as of january 2010 most consumer flash products can withstand only around 100,000 rewrites before memory begins to deteriorate ) several newer technologies are attempting to replace flash in certain roles , and some even claim to be a truly universal memory , offering the performance of the best sram devices with the non-volatility of flash for example , ibm pc 's and successors beginning with the ibm pc at used nonvolatile bios memory , often called cmos ram or parameter ram , and this was a common solution in other early microcomputer systems like the original apple macintosh , which used a small amount of memory powered by a battery for storing basic setup information like the selected boot volume ( the original ibm pc and pc xt instead used dip switches to represent up to 24 bits of system configuration data ; dip or similar switches are another , primitive type of programmable rom device that was widely used in the 1970s and 1980s for very small amounts of data & mdash ; typically no more than 8 bytes much larger battery backed memories are still used today as caches for high-speed databases that require a performance level newer nvram devices have not yet managed to meet the extra '' e '' stands for electrically , referring to the ability to reset eeprom using electricity instead of uv , making the devices much easier to use in practice this process has the disadvantage of mechanically degrading the chip , however , so memory systems based on floating-gate transistors in general have short write-lifetimes , on the order of 10 5 writes to any particular bit flash allows its memory to be written only in blocks , which greatly simplifies the internal wiring and allows for higher densities memory storage density is the main determinant of cost in most computer memory systems , and due to this flash has evolved into one of the lowest cost solid-state memory devices available starting around 2000 , demand for ever-greater quantities of flash have driven manufacturers to use only the latest fabrication systems in order to increase density as much as possible due to this crystal structure and how it is influenced , f-ram offers distinct properties from other nonvolatile memory options , including extremely high endurance ( exceeding 10 16 access cycles for 3.3 & nbsp ; v devices ) , ultra low power consumption ( since f-ram does not require a charge pump like other non-volatile memories ) , single-cycle write speeds , and gamma radiation tolerance another approach to see major development effort is magnetoresistive random-access memory , or mram , which uses magnetic elements and in general operates in a fashion similar to core , at least for the first-generation technology pram is based on the same storage mechanism as writable cds and dvds , but reads them based on their changes in electrical resistance rather than changes in their optical properties in theory the technology offers storage densities on the order of 1 tbit/in² ( ≈394 gbit/cm² ) , greater than even the best hard drive technologies currently in use ( perpendicular recording offers 636 gbit/in² ( ≈250.4 gbit/cm² ) as of dec such devices are claimed to have the advantage that they utilise the same technology as hkmg ( high-l metal gate ) based lithography , and scale to the same size as a conventional fet at a given process node
