research has shown that perception of the müller-lyer illusion can vary herskovits on whether culture can influence such basic aspects of perception such as the length of a line , they suggested that their student marshall segall investigate the problem in their definitive paper of 1966 , they investigated seventeen cultures and showed that people in different cultures differ substantially on how they experience the müller-lyer stimuli , 1978 , 69 , 233-241 while this by no means confirms the carpentered world hypothesis as such , it provides evidence that differences in the environment can create differences in the perception of the müller-lyer illusion , even within a given culture , an explanation based on past experience with the sources of such stimuli ) , convex and concave corners contribute little if anything to the müller-lyer effect neural nets in the visual system of human beings learn how to make a very efficient interpretation of 3d scenes visual illusions are sometimes held to show us that what we see is an image created in our brain our brain supposedly projects the image of the smaller hand to its correct distance in our internal 3d model in the müller-lyer illusion , the visual system would in this explanation detect the depth cues , which are usually associated with 3d scenes , and incorrectly decide it is a 3d drawing then the size constancy mechanism would make us see an erroneous length of the object which , for a true perspective drawing , would be farther away in the perspective drawing in the figure , we see that in usual scenes the heuristic works quite well though the integration coarsens the positional acuity , such pooling seems to be quite biologically substantiated since it allows fast and reliable assessment of the location of the visual object as whole , irrespective of its size , the shape complexity , and illumination conditions the relative displacement of all stimulus terminators leads to misjudgment of distances between them ; that is , the illusion occurs as a side effect due to necessarily low spatial resolution of the neural mechanism of assessment of the relative location of the visual objects
