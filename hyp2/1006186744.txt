the capital is often the largest city of its constituent , though not always historically , the major economic centre of a state or region has often become the focal point of political power , and became a capital through conquest or federation ( the modern capital city has , however , not always existed : in medieval western europe , an itinerant court was common they are recognized as capitals as a matter of convention , and because all or almost all the country 's central political institutions , such as government departments , supreme court , legislature , embassies , etc in australia , the term '' capital cities '' is regularly used to refer to those six state capitals plus the federal capital canberra , and darwin , the capital of the northern territory in unitary states which consist of multiple constituent nations , such as the united kingdom and the kingdom of denmark , each will usually have its own capital city unlike in federations , there is usually not a separate national capital , but rather the capital city of one constituent nation will also be the capital of the state overall , such as london , which is the capital of england and of the united kingdom , us ( 1800 ) these cities satisfy one or both of the following criteria : a deliberately planned city that was built expressly to house the seat of government , superseding a capital city that was in an established population center a town that was chosen as a compromise among two or more cities ( or other political divisions ) , none of which was willing to concede to the the privilege of being the capital city the previous capital , auckland , lies much further north in the north island ; the move followed a long argument for a more central location for parliament managua , nicaragua , chosen to appease rivals in león and granada , which also were associated with the liberal and conservative political factions respectively jefferson city , missouri was selected as the state capital in 1821 , the year after missouri was admitted to the union , due to its central location within the state some have a city as the capital but with most government agencies elsewhere brno is home to all three of the country 's highest courts , making it the de facto capital of the czech judicial branch various ministries are located in the former west german capital of bonn , which now has the title '' federal city '' dharamshala , which is also the headquarters of the central tibetan administration , is the second winter capital of the state the city itself is administered as a union territory south korea : seoul remains as the capital and seat of the government 's branches , but many government agencies have moved to sejong city national government institutions are scattered within the metropolis instead of being concentrated within the capital city the presidential palace ( malacañang palace ) and the supreme court are located within the capital city but the two houses of congress are located in separate suburbs however , many government offices are still located in colombo new york : much like illinois , the state capital and government are headquartered in albany , but many officials are mostly active in or live in new york city monaco , singapore , and the vatican city are city-states , and thus do not contain any distinct capital city as a whole however , in singapore 's case , the main judiciary and legislative offices are located in the downtown core similarly , while victoria was the capital of colonial hong kong , the district of central serves as the seat of government offices today there are several countries where , for various reasons , the official capital and de facto seat of government are separated : benin : porto-novo is the official capital , but cotonou is the seat of government netherlands : amsterdam is the constitutional national capital even though the dutch government , the parliament , the supreme court , the council of state , and the work palace of the king are all located in the hague , as are all the embassies ) some historical examples of similar arrangements , where the recognized capital was not the official seat of government : kingdom of england : the traditional capital was the city of london , while westminster , outside of the boundaries of the city of london , was the seat of government kingdom of france : the traditional capital was paris , though from 1682 to 1789 the seat of government was at the palace of versailles , located in a rural area southwest of paris with the rise of the modern nation state , the capital city has become a symbol for the state and its government , and imbued with political meaning other restored capital cities include moscow after the october revolution the selection or founding of a '' neutral '' capital city , one unencumbered by regional or political identities , was meant to represent the unity of a new state when ankara , bern , canberra , madrid , ottawa and washington became capital cities sometimes , the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate squabbling or possible squabbling between various entities , such as in the cases of canberra , ottawa , washington , wellington and managua the british-built town of new delhi represented a simultaneous break and continuity with the past , the location of delhi being where many imperial capitals were built ( indraprastha , dhillika , and shahjahanabad ) but the actual capital being the new british-built town designed by edwin lutyens wellington , on the southwestern tip of the north island of new zealand , replaced the much more northerly city of auckland to place the national capital close to the south island and hence to placate its residents , many of whom had sympathies with separatism
