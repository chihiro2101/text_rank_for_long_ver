right to die is the belief that people have a right to die , either through various forms of suicide , euthanasia , or refusing life-saving medical treatment the motivation for this is to distance the debate from the suicides commonly performed by those not terminally ill and not eligible for assistance where it is legal arguments in support of assisted death include respect for patient autonomy , equal treatment of terminally ill patients on and off life support , compassion , personal liberty , transparency and ethics of responsibility pain is mostly not reported as the primary motivation for seeking physician-assisted suicide in the united states ; the three most frequently mentioned end‐of‐life concerns reported by oregon residents who took advantage of the death with dignity act in 2015 were : decreasing ability to participate in activities that made life enjoyable ( 96.2 % ) , loss of autonomy ( 92.4 % ) , and loss of dignity ( 75.4 % ) during 2015 , there were 218 people in the state who were approved and received the lethal drugs to end their own life in the state of oregon 's 2015 survey , they asked the terminally ill who were participating in medical aid in dying , what their biggest end-of-life concerns were : 96.2 % of those people mentioned the loss of the ability to participate in activities that once made them enjoy life , 92.4 % mentioned the loss of autonomy , or their independence of their own thoughts or actions , and 75.4 % stated loss of their dignity polls conducted by gallup dating back to 1947 positing the question , '' when a person has a disease that can not be cured , do you think doctors should be allowed to end the patient 's life by some painless means if the patient and his family request it ? '' show support for the practice increasing from 37 % in 1947 to a plateau of approximately 75 % lasting from approximately 1990 to 2005 when the polling question was modified as such so the question posits '' severe pain '' as opposed to an incurable disease , '' legalization '' as opposed to generally allowing doctors , and '' patient suicide '' rather than physician-administered voluntary euthanasia , public support was substantially lower , by approximately 10 % to 15 % the patient must meet with two physicians and they must confirm the diagnoses before one can continue ; in some cases , they do include a psychiatric evaluation as well to determine whether or not the patient is making this decision on their own a written request which must be witnessed by two different people , one of which can not be a family member , and then another waiting period by the patient 's doctor in which they say whether they are eligible for the drugs or not ( '' death with dignity '' ) according to a 1988 general resolution , '' unitarian universalists advocate the right to self-determination in dying , and the release from civil or criminal penalties of those who , under proper safeguards , act to honor the right of terminally ill patients to select the time of their own deaths '' the original oath however has been modified many times and , contrary to popular belief , is not required by most modern medical schools , nor confers any legal obligations on individuals who choose to take it the international code of medical ethics , last revised in 2006 , includes '' a physician shall always bear in mind the obligation to respect human life '' in the section '' duties of physicians to patients '' this argument encompasses the apprehension that once pas is initiated for the terminally ill it will progress to other vulnerable communities , namely the disabled , and may begin to be used by those who feel less worthy based on their demographic or socioeconomic status the roman catholic church acknowledges the fact that moral decisions regarding a person 's life must be made according to one 's own conscience and faith catholic tradition has said that one 's concern for the suffering of another is not a sufficient reason to decide whether it is appropriate to act upon voluntary euthanasia as an alternative to the physician-assisted suicide and in order to alleviate pain , the catholic church proposes that terminally ill patients focus on religion and making peace with the creator while receiving the love and mercy of their families and caregivers the conclusion of the majority of later rabbinic authorities , and accepted normative practice within judaism , is that suicide and assisted suicide can not be sanctioned even for a terminal patient in intractable pain there have been calls for organisations representing medical professionals to take a neutral stance on assisted dying , rather than a position of opposition it is widely acknowledged that physicians must play some role in the process of assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia ( as evident in the name '' physician-assisted suicide '' ) , often putting them at the forefront of the issue
