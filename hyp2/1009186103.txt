the rulebook not only contained rules for character creation ( including monster player characters ) , combat , and magic but also wargames rules for battles and sieges the background was heavily influenced by medieval france and christianity , with knights ( tournaments , courtly love , fiefs , political influence ) , a hierarchical priesthood who could perform miracles , and a large section on monsters that included the infernal court of demons in addition to ideas taken from arthurian myth , the first edition also incorporated elements of j thus , c & s has less of a modern literary influence than d & d , dungeons & dragons was heavily influenced by 20th century fantasy literature both the game 's writers and most of its players had at least a passing familiarity with modern fantasy early editions of dungeons & dragons even had a reading list in the back with lists of authors and their works to expand upon that knowledge the hyperbolic names for the magical system 's spells were influenced by jack vance 's dying earth stories ; the '' excellent prismatic sphere '' spell was completely lifted from the source material tolkien as the player may choose from among a human , elf , the elves , especially the '' calaquendi '' are by far the most powerful race in c & s1 as they are both fighters and magick users this is similar to dungeons & dragon 's six attributes , except the attribute of charisma is split into the two primary characteristics of appearance ( physical attractiveness ) and bardic voice ( oration and persuasiveness ) finally , taking into account the characteristics , the astral sign , social background , race and natural inclination , the player decides what role the character will follow a magician can choose among 4 major classes ( natural magic users , minor arcanes , major arcanes , and mystics ) that divide into 19 sub-classes clerics are also present , but are almost exclusively of a monotheistic faith with a christian-like hierarchy ( as the game was intended as a simulation of an essentially medieval christian europe ) the creation of a character in c & s1 is complex and may require several hours in the company of a game master , but the characters have their creation story , an experience that gives them a head start in creating a back-story for the character and assisting the player 's role this certainly influenced the game to campaigns in which the mortality figures are considerably lower than in other role-playing , which has the effect of requiring a lot of attention in preparation of c & s scenarios and difficulty level by the game master , especially as returning from the dead is not common in c & s , compared to other games like d & d combat in c & s attempts to be more realistic than the abstract systems of games such as d & d , though it still has the armour class and hit table concepts the rules of magic , being scattered over several chapters of the rule book , made it difficult to follow in practice , pmf determines the scope and duration of spells and the number of volumes of materials used by the magick user ( see below on magic basic ) this aspect of magic is questionable because the power of a spell will depend in some cases the level of the spell ( spells the highest levels being most powerful ) but for basic magic spells will no longer depend on the level of the spell but the magician pmf is to say its power ) all sorts of bm are the result of mixing of at least one spell of creation / manipulation ( and up to three ) and an element knowing that we can combine up to three spells of creation / manipulation with an item , the number of possible combinations is immense a magician will generally focus on one or two elements and attempt to optimize combinations using them finally , the solitary hex master uses their knowledge of black magic and demons to fight evil , which requires a lawful alignment the mystics are three in number and practice more esoteric forms of magic , even than their colleagues in other classes this form of magic is sufficiently distant from the jewish kabbalah , but rather a kind of '' generic '' cabalist , which can be adapted to different cultures ( judeo-christian , nordic , etc their knowledge is the most hermetic and difficult to teach , which may explain why this magick users class is very uncommon in c & s campaigns the process of making magic items was particularly detailed and far more advanced than other games of the moment focus : these are enchanted like magical items of power , but each class of magick user produces a type of focus of its own it will store a huge number of spells in and they can use their focus for their personal magic defense despite the interest and realism of the system , which makes a case demonic invocations no mage can not afford to treat lightly , this part of the system has not been well integrated with the rules of magic and is confined to the end of the rules one of the most interesting details of the game is an opportunity for a magick user to be part of a guild or society , more or less secret , including members of their class , and sometimes other classes of magicians pursuing the same ideals and animated by the same designs the advantage of belonging to a guild or society for a magick user is to have access to knowledge of the guild , which is sometimes overwhelming and made available to members only often , the mage will be on a mission by their guild , which provides the game master opportunities for scenarios within the guild , the young mage will have to prove their abilities and is framed in their infancy by a master who taught them their first spell and ensure its training and its protection then , when it reaches the mkl9 , the student becomes the master and can in turn take an apprentice , thus perpetuating the spread of the knowledge and traditions of the guild the members of such an order , very limited and highly selective , are the natural enemies of sorcerers , necromancers and by extension any user of black magick which aims to get more power through knowledge and use of magic '' in the september 1980 edition ( issue 4 ) , eric goldberg liked the well-researched information on the medieval period — particularly heraldry — presented in the rules , but bemoaned the complexity , saying , '' the worst problem arises when the game is actually played — it can move as awkwardly as an octopus on dry land although goldberg admitted that '' no frp system has since matched the quantity and quality of its technical system design '' , he did not recommend the game : '' c & s is a poor game for all but the serious devotee of fantasy one addition in this second edition ( which would subsequently be extended to the whole system of rules in the later editions ) is the appearance of skills , mainly—but not exclusively—for thieves , murderers and affiliated professions this system of skills ( very popular in the roleplaying of the vintage , including in particular chaosium 's ) diversifies the characters away from rigid traditional stereotypes the mass combat system was removed from the second edition , but could be found in various forms in extensions of the game , especially swords & sorcerers and the two sourcebooks c & s refocused on the roleplaying aspect and its wargame aspect was set aside , presumably both to reduce the size and complexity system of basic rules and to mark the distinction between genres with c & s2 , the system was designed as a complete simulation of the middle ages in all its aspects : political , economic , and military ; enhanced by a strong fantasy element , derived mainly from the world of j tolkien , giving a strong sense of realism , much stronger than in most other games in the same period in the october 1983 edition of white dwarf ( issue 46 ) , marcus rowland gave the improved production values of the second edition a 10 out of 10 , but found various aspects were still overly complex : '' overall , character generation in c & s is still extremely complicated and might take inexperienced players several hours , especially if they make the fatal mistake of working in the wrong order '' rowland concluded by scoring the complexity of the game 10 out of 10 and its playability only 6 out of 10 , and expressed reservations about the suitability for new gamers : '' i can not recommend this game to inexperienced referees or players , but anyone with some knowledge of roleplaying games who is looking for a complex system for a prolonged campaign will probably find chivalry & sorcery ideal '' paul mason reviewed chivalry & sorcery 2nd edition for imagine magazine , and stated that '' chivalry & sorcery mistakenly attempts to compete with the ad & d game in terms of detail – a hopeless task which can only produce a fragmented and complex set of rules as a reference work , and as a source of ideas for incorporation into other games , chivalry & sorcery is still excellent , but i doubt it will shake its popular image as a cult game on the fringes of the hobby mainstream c & s is still the most difficult and time-consuming frp system on the market , when played at a level that fully exploits its virtues but as a complete campaign system , the virtues of c & s are only fully realized in the hands of the superior gamer — one who ’ s serious , sophisticated , dedicated , and familiar with medieval history , legend , and fantasy literature basically it was trying to be like their biggest competitor , the more mainstream dungeons & dragons , but with a different rules system c & s3 established a system of '' skills '' which covers all areas of the game , including fighting , magic , knowledge of geography , languages , dances and songs , and other things a person is able to do or know the '' bestiary '' , a collection of monsters and mundane creatures , was considered by many of the players to be an example of what they wanted and needed for their campaigns ; unfortunately , it was released almost a year after the game launched , 1998 ) stated that '' it definitely uses some modern production features ( though the layout is a bit busy and plagued by typos ) , but the defining aspects of most '90s games - quick character generation , rules-lightness , storytelling not dice-rolling - are n't a part of this game the result was the return of some medieval references and some gameplay mechanics ( such as '' bash '' or '' targeting '' for spells ) adding this degree of realism that was lacking in the previous edition a kingdom based on england set in a much larger game world called archaeron ( hinted at in an article printed in different worlds issue 1 ) the world of intelligent dinosaurs in the saurians supplement ( the section dealing with the saurian hss'taathi is however set within the world of archaeron ) marakush more so than many others , with six books released as either world books or scenarios set directly in marakush the overriding theme of chivalry & sorcery settings is a world where magic is rare , and whose societies mimic real-world medieval
