in conservation biology , minimum viable population ( mvp ) size helps to determine the effective population size when a population is at risk for extinction the effects of a population bottleneck often depend on the number of individuals remaining after the bottleneck and how that compares to the minimum viable population size alternatively , invasive species can undergo population bottlenecks through founder events when introduced into their invaded range according to a 1999 model , a severe population bottleneck , or more specifically a full-fledged speciation , occurred among a group of australopithecine as they transitioned into the species known as homo erectus two million years ago the animals living today are all descended from 12 individuals and they have extremely low genetic variation , which may be beginning to affect the reproductive ability of bulls with so much of a colony 's offspring descended from just one dominant male , genetic diversity is limited , making the species more vulnerable to diseases and genetic mutations there is also evidence of at least one primate species , the golden snub-nosed monkey , that also suffered from a bottleneck around this time the bottlenecks likely caused the low genetic diversity observed in both species these declines in population were the result of hunting and habitat destruction , but the random consequences have also caused a great loss in species diversity population bottlenecking poses a major threat to the stability of species populations as well the remaining two populations are now geographically isolated and the populations face an unstable future with limited remaining opportunity for gene flow this reduced genetic diversity in many crops could lead to broader susceptibility to new diseases or pests , which threatens global food security the low population size and low genetic diversity indicates that the wollemi pine went through a severe population bottleneck
