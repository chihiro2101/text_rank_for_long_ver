the susa in susanoo 's name has been variously explained as being derived from either of the following words : the verb susabu or susamu meaning 'to be impetuous , ' 'to be violent , ' or 'to go wild ' the verb susumu 'to advance ' the township of susa ( 須佐郷 ) in iishi district , izumo province ( modern shimane prefecture ) a word related to middle korean susung meaning 'master ' or 'shaman ' the circumstances surrounding the birth of these three deities , collectively known as the '' three precious children '' ( 三貴子 – mihashira-no-uzunomiko , sankishi ) , however , vary between sources ( in the kojiki , hiruko is the couple 's very first offspring , born before the islands of japan and the other deities were created ; there he is set afloat on a reed boat as in other versions , susanoo – who '' was of a wicked nature , and was always fond of wailing and wrath '' – is here expelled by his parents another variant account in the shoki has susanoo meet a kami named ha'akarutama ( 羽明玉 ) on his way to heaven originally a deity of foreign import ( india and korea have all been suggested as possible origins ) , gozu tennō was widely revered since the heian period as a god of pestilence , who both caused disease and cured them this legend relates that mutō , a god from the northern sea , embarked on a long journey to court the daughter of the god of the southern seas the earliest known version of this legend , found in the fudoki of bingo province ( modern eastern hiroshima prefecture ) compiled during the nara period ( preserved in an extract quoted by scholar and shinto priest urabe kanekata in the shaku nihongi ) , has mutō explicitly identify himself as susanoo sources that equate gozu tennō with susanoo only first appear during the kamakura period ( 1185–1333 ) , although one theory supposes that these three gods and various other disease-related deities were already loosely coalesced around the 9th century , probably around the year 877 when a major epidemic swept through japan in the kojiki and the shoki he is portrayed first as a petulant young man , then as an unpredictable , violent boor who causes chaos and destruction before turning into a monster-slaying culture hero after descending into the world of men , while in the izumo fudoki , he is simply a local god apparently connected with rice fields , with almost none of the traits associated with him in the imperial mythologies being mentioned the early 20th century historian : ja : 津田左右吉 , who put forward the then-controversial theory that the kojiki 's accounts were not based on history ( as edo period kokugaku and state shinto ideology believed them to be ) but rather propagandistic myths concocted to explain and legitimize the rule of the imperial ( yamato ) dynasty , also saw susanoo as a negative figure , arguing that he was created to serve as the rebellious opposite of the imperial ancestress amaterasu other scholars , however , take the position that susanoo was not originally conceived of as a negative deity while the izumo fudoki claims that the township of susa in izumo is named after its deity susanoo , it has been proposed that the opposite might have actually been the case and susanoo was named after the place , with his name being understood in this case as meaning '' man ( o ) of susa while both matsumura and matsumoto preferred to connect susanoo with rice fields and the harvest , : ja : 松前健 put forward the theory that susanoo was originally worshiped as a patron deity of sailors ) matsumae proposed that the worship of susanoo was brought to other places in japan by seafaring peoples from kii , a land rich in timber ( the province 's name is itself derived from the word ki meaning 'tree ' ) a few myths , such as that of susanoo 's descent in soshimori in silla , seem to suggest a connection between the god and the korean peninsula indeed , some scholars have hypothesized that the deities who were eventually conflated with susanoo , mutō tenjin , and gozu tennō , may have had korean origins as well , with the name 'mutō ' ( 武塔 , historical orthography : mutau ) being linked with the korean word mudang '' shamaness , '' and 'gozu ' being explained as a calque of 'soshimori ' , here interpreted as being derived from a korean toponym meaning 'bull 's ( so ) head ( mari ) ' susanoo is thus supposed in this view to have originally been a foreign god ( 蕃神 banshin ) , perhaps a deified shaman , whose origins may be traced back to korea emilia gadeleva ( 2000 ) sees susanoo 's original character as being that of a rain god – more precisely , a god associated with rainmaking – with his association with the harvest and a number of other elements from his myths ultimately springing from his connection with rainwater gadeleva also acknowledges the foreign elements in the god 's character by supposing that rainmaking rituals and concepts were brought to japan in ancient times from the continent , with the figure of the korean shaman ( susung ) who magically controlled the abundance of rain eventually morphing into the japanese susanoo , but at the same time stresses that susanoo is not completely a foreign import but must have had japanese roots at his core in gadeleva 's view , while the god certainly underwent drastic changes upon his introduction in the imperial myth cycle , susanoo 's character already bore positive and negative features since the beginning , with both elements stemming from his association with rain while sometimes seemingly considered to be more or less identical to yomi , the land of the dead ( the kojiki speaks of ne-no-kuni as the land of susanoo 's deceased mother izanami , who is stated earlier in the narrative to have become the ruler of yomi , and calls the slope serving at its exit the yomotsu hirasaka , the 'flat slope of yomi ' ) , it would seem that the two were originally considered to be different locations while matsumura takeo suggested that ne-no-kuni originally referred to the dimly remembered original homeland of the japanese people , emilia gadeleva instead proposes that the two locales , while similar in that both were subterranean realms associated with darkness , differed from each other in that yomi was associated with death , while ne-no-kuni , as implied by the myth about ōnamuji , was seemingly associated with rebirth in time , however , the two locations were confused with each other , so that by the time the kojiki and the shoki were written ne-no-kuni came to be seen like yomi as an unclean realm of the dead ( note that as mentioned above , one of the variants in the shoki does place susanoo 's ravages and banishment before the performance of the ukehi ritual ) tsuda sōkichi saw a political significance in this story : he interpreted amaterasu as an emperor-symbol , while susanoo in his view symbolized the various rebels who ( unsuccessfully ) rose up against the yamato court a prayer or norito originally recited by the priestly nakatomi clan in the presence of the court during the great exorcism ( 大祓 , ōharae ) ritual of the last day of the sixth month , more commonly known today as the ōharae no kotoba ( 大祓詞 , 'words of the great exorcism ' ) , lists eight '' heavenly sins '' ( japanese : 天つ罪 , tsumi ) , most of which are agricultural in nature : breaking down the ridges covering up the ditches releasing the irrigation sluices double planting setting up stakes skinning alive skinning backward defecation 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 and 8 are committed by susanoo in the kojiki , while 3 , 4 , 5 are attributed to him in the shoki ) susanoo 's children by kamu-ōichihime meanwhile are : toshigami ( 大年神 ) ukanomitama ( 宇迦之御魂神 ) susanoo 's children who are either born without a female partner or whose mother is
