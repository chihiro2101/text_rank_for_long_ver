to guide the iteration process , a project control list is created that contains a record of all tasks that need to be performed the control list is constantly being revised as a result of the analysis phase in a light-weight iterative project the code may represent the major source of documentation of the system ; however , in a critical iterative project a formal software design document may be used inception identifies project scope , requirements ( functional and non-functional ) and risks at a high level but in enough detail that work can be estimated their motivation for avoiding the waterfall life cycle was that the shuttle program ’ s requirements changed during the software development process the dod instruction 5000.2 released in 2000 stated a clear preference for iid : there are two approaches , evolutionary and single step waterfall , to full capability … in this approach , the ultimate capability delivered to the user is divided into two or more blocks , with increasing increments of capability.software development shall follow an iterative spiral development process in which continually expanding software versions are based on learning from earlier development the main cause of the software development projects failure is the choice of the model , so should be made with a great care business value is delivered all at once , and only at the very end of the project , whereas backtracking is possible in an iterative approach variability : the software is delivered to the user only after the build stage of the life cycle is completed , for user acceptance testing time limitation : an operational product is delivered after months while in the incremental model the product is given to the user within a few weeks the existing implementation should be analyzed frequently to determine how well it measures up to project goals program analysis facilities should be used whenever available to aid in the analysis of partial implementations
