( 2001 ) , '' will hays '' entry political pressure was increasing , with legislators in 37 states introducing almost one hundred movie censorship bills in 1921 the move mimicked the decision major league baseball had made in hiring judge kenesaw mountain landis as league commissioner the previous year to quell questions about the integrity of baseball in the wake of the black sox scandal ; the new york times even called hays the '' screen landis '' '' in 1924 , hays introduced a set of recommendations dubbed '' the formula '' , which the studios were advised to heed , and asked filmmakers to describe to his office the plots of pictures they were planning on making and while there had been token attempts to clean up the movies before—such as when the studios formed the national association of the motion picture industry ( nampi ) in 1916—little had come of the efforts new york became the first state to take advantage of the supreme court 's decision by instituting a censorship board in 1921 with eight individual states having a board by the advent of sound film , lasalle ( 2000 ) , p early in the sound system conversion process , it became apparent that what was acceptable in new york might not be so in kansas in 1927 , hays suggested to studio executives that they form a committee to discuss film censorship allen of paramount responded by collaborating on a list they called the '' don'ts and be carefuls '' , which was based on items that were challenged by local censor boards the controversy surrounding film standards came to a head in 1929 many of these would later become key points in the code 301–302 specifically , the mppda resolved , '' that those things which are included in the following list shall not appear in pictures produced by the members of this association , irrespective of the manner in which they are treated '' : the production code was intended to put a limitation on films which were distributed to a large audience , making it more difficult to appeal to all individuals in the audiences the second part was a set of '' particular applications '' , which was an exacting list of items that could not be depicted the code sought not only to determine what could be portrayed on screen , but also to promote traditional values it was initially decided to keep the catholic influence on the code secret on february 19 , 1930 , variety published the entire content of the code and predicted that state film censorship boards would soon become obsolete ; black ( 1996 ) , pp the first film the office reviewed , the blue angel , which was passed by joy with no revisions , was considered indecent by a california censor joy had to review 500 films a year with a small staff and little power in 1930 , the hays office did not have the authority to order studios to remove material from a film , and instead worked by reasoning and sometimes pleading with them the publication stated that if crime were never to be presented in a sympathetic light , then taken literally that would mean that '' law '' and '' justice '' would become one and the same therefore , events such as the boston tea party could not be portrayed the great depression of the 1930s led many studios to seek income by any way possible in 1931 , the hollywood reporter mocked the code and quoted an anonymous screenwriter saying that '' the hays moral code is not even a joke any more ; it 's just a memory '' ; two years later variety followed suit for more than thirty years , virtually all motion pictures produced in the united states adhered to the code the production code was not created or enforced by federal , state , or city government ; the hollywood studios adopted the code in large part in the hopes of avoiding government censorship , preferring self-regulation to government regulation breen — a prominent catholic layman who had worked in public relations — was appointed head of the new production code administration ( pca ) breen influenced the production of casablanca , objecting to any explicit reference to rick and ilsa having slept together in paris and to the film mentioning that captain renault extorted sexual favors from his supplicants ; however , both remained strongly implied in the finished version of virginia ( 2000–01 ) , '' censored '' adherence to the code also ruled out any possibility of the film ending with rick and ilsa consummating their adulterous love , making inevitable the ending with rick 's noble renunciation , one of casablancas most famous scenes the first major instance of censorship under the production code involved the 1934 film tarzan and his mate , in which brief nude scenes involving a body double for actress maureen o'sullivan were edited out of the master negative of the film another famous case of enforcement involved the 1943 western the outlaw , produced by howard hughes the outlaw was denied a certificate of approval and kept out of theaters for years , because the film 's advertising focused particular attention on jane russell 's breasts hughes eventually persuaded breen that the breasts did not violate the code , and the film could be shown wanted to make a film about nazi concentration camps , the production office forbade it—citing the above-mentioned prohibition on depicting '' in an unfavorable light '' another country 's '' institutions and prominent people '' —with threats to take the matter to the federal government if the studio went ahead the brothers warner ( 2007 ) , written by cass warner this policy prevented a number of anti-nazi films being produced with the three stooges ' short subject you nazty spy ! ( january 1940 ) being the first hollywood film of any sort to openly spoof the third reich 's leadership director edward dmytryk later said that the code '' had a very good effect because it made us think hollywood continued to work within the confines of the production code throughout the 1950s , but during this time , the movie industry was faced with very serious competitive threats the first threat came from a new technology , television , which did not require americans to leave their house to watch moving pictures hollywood needed to offer the public something it could not get on television , which itself was under an even more restrictive censorship code vertical integration in the movie industry had been found to violate anti-trust laws , and studios had been forced to give up ownership of theaters by the supreme court in united states v industrial commission of ohio ) and held that motion pictures were entitled to first amendment protection , so that the new york state board of regents could not ban the miracle , a short film that was one half of l'amore ( 1948 ) , an anthology film directed by roberto rossellini by the 1950s , american culture also began to change a boycott by the national legion of decency no longer guaranteed a film 's commercial failure , and several aspects of the code had slowly lost their taboo by 1962 , such subject matter was acceptable , and the original film was given a seal of approval owing to its themes , billy wilder 's some like it hot ( 1959 ) was not granted a certificate of approval , but it still became a box office smash , and , as a result , it further weakened the authority of the code his 1953 film the moon is blue , about a young woman who tries to play two suitors off against each other by claiming that she plans to keep her virginity until marriage , was released without a certificate of approval hirsch ( 2007 ) in the early 1960s , films began to deal with adult subjects and sexual matters that had not been seen in hollywood films since the early 1930s despite the rejection , the film 's producers arranged for allied artists to release the film without the production code seal , with the new york censors licensing the film without the cuts demanded by code administrators the exception to the code was granted as a '' special and unique case '' and was described by the new york times at the time as '' an unprecedented move that will not , however , set a precedent '' in pictures at a revolution , a 2008 study of films during that era , mark harris wrote that the mpaa approval was '' the first of a series of injuries to the production code that would prove fatal within three years '' released who 's afraid of virginia woolf ?
