this austere location , hardly an obvious choice for the site of a royal palace , was chosen by king philip ii of spain , and it was he who ordained the building of a grand edifice here to commemorate the 1557 spanish victory at the battle of st he also intended the complex to serve as a necropolis for the interment of the remains of his parents , charles i and isabella of portugal , himself , and his descendants with toledo 's death in 1567 , direction passed to his apprentice , juan de herrera , under whom the building was completed in 1584 , in less than 21 years image : escorial traza def.jpg thumb left el escorial : floor plan , based on the floorplan of solomon 's temple since then , el escorial has been the burial site for most of the spanish kings of the last five centuries , bourbons as well as habsburgs the grill-like shape , which did not fully emerge until herrera eliminated from the original conception the six interior towers of the facade , was , by no means , unique to el escorial other buildings had been constructed with interior courtyards fronting on churches or chapels ; king 's college , cambridge , dating from 1441 , is one such example ; the old ospedale maggiore , milan 's first hospital , begun in 1456 by antonio filarete , is another grid-like building with interior courtyards nonetheless , the most persuasive theory for the origin of the floor plan is that it is based on descriptions of the temple of solomon by the judeo-roman historian , flavius josephus : a portico followed by a courtyard open to the sky , followed by a second portico and a second courtyard , all flanked by arcades and enclosed passageways , leading to the '' holy of holies '' statues of david and solomon on either side of the entrance to the basilica of el escorial lend further weight to the theory that this is the true origin of the design hermetism and the mystical architecture of the society of jesus in '' baroque art : the jesuit contribution '' by rudolf wittkower & irma jaffe the temple-of-solomon design , if indeed it was the basis for el escorial , was extensively modified to accommodate the additional functions and purposes philip ii intended the building to serve in order to describe the parts of the great building in a coherent fashion , it may be useful to undertake an imaginary walking tour , beginning with the main entrance at the center of the western facade : the first thing one finds upon arriving to el escorial is the main façade this has three doors : the middle one leads to the courtyard of the kings ( patio de los reyes ) and the side ones lead to a school and the other to a monastery the remains of juan de borbon , father of king juan carlos i of spain , also rest in this pantheon despite the fact that he never became king himself this is a gardened patio in whose center rises a magnificent pavilion by juan de herrera in which one can find sculptures of the evangelists next is the palace of the austrians ( palacio de los austrias ) , also known as the house of the king ( casa del rey ) , which is found behind the presbytery of the basilica inside the house of the king are the sala de las batallas ( hall of battles ) , which contains frescoes of the battles of san quintín and higueruela , among others left the basilica of san lorenzo el real , the central building in the el escorial complex , was originally designed , like most of the late gothic cathedrals of western europe , to take the form of a latin cross this plan was modified by juan de herrera to that of a greek cross , a form with all four arms of equal length coincident with this shift in approach , the bell towers at the western end of the church were somewhat reduced in size and the small half-dome intended to stand over the altar was replaced with a full circular dome over the center of the church , where the four arms of the greek cross meet the most highly decorated part of the church is the area surrounding the high altar in a shallow niche at the center of the lowest level is the tabernacle , a repository for the physical elements of the communion ceremony , a so-called '' house of the sacrament '' , designed by juan de herrera in jasper and bronze michelangelo died in 1564 , scarcely a year after the first stones at el escorial were laid , and titian , when asked to come to spain , respectfully refused on the basis of his advanced age situated next to the main altar of the basilica , the residence of king philip ii is made up of a series of austerely decorated rooms the remains of alphonse xiii 's third son juan , count of barcelona and daughter-in-law maria de las mercedes ( the father and mother of the former king juan carlos i ) , lie at a prepared place called a pudridero , or decaying chamber , awaiting interment in the pantheon of the kings it was the first library on the continent that broke with medieval design the library , like everything else in el escorial , forms part of a larger symbolic structure and has symbolic meaning functioning within it phillip ’ s library began using a “ wall system ” placing the bookcases along the walls this library was a renaissance statement of power , majesty , prowess , and intellectual world leadership designed for both the preservation of the old ( binding multiple cultural histories into a single catholic spanish culture ) and discovery of the new ( imprinted by that culture ) this arrangement of parallel book cases was initiated by philip ii and was called the '' wall system '' it was planned by juan de herrera , who shared the king 's neoplatonic views and also designed the library ’ s shelves ; the frescoes on the vaulted ceilings were painted by pellegrino tibaldi during the reign of phillip ii , there was an entire room dedicated to ancient manuscripts , most of them in latin , many in greek , but also some in hebrew , aramaic , arabic , italian , french , and spanish as part of his active efforts , in 1571 philip ii bought a large portion of the collection of gonzalo pérez , one of his advisors he also bought 315 original volumes from juan páez de castro 's personal library , in greek and arabic the king assigned specific ambassadors charged with traveling through his empire and neighboring kingdoms searching and buying the best acquisitions for el escorial 's library diego guzmán de silva was one of such ambassadors and made one of the most important purchases for the library during his time in venice : an ancient collection of greek manuscripts and latin codecs ( 1569–1577 ) other valuable libraries acquired from various erudites by king philip ii were the library of pedro fajardo , and of antonio agustín , one of the largest in spain at the time not all of those books are still in el escorial since many ended up in the vatican , but around a thousand of them can still be found there before his death , philip ii left in his last will a pension for the escorial library to ensure that it would still be able to acquire new volumes in addition to continuing the search for and purchase of especially valuable and old books , he promulgated a new decree according to which the library of el escorial ought to receive a copy of every book published inside the empire arias montano donated a large number of original hebrew manuscripts , and admiral luis fajardo brought back the complete zaydani library captured during his wars with the sultan muley zidán shortly after , as the habsburg dynasty came to its end and the bourbons took the throne after the war of the spanish succession , a further loss took place , as the bourbon kings reversed the trend of acquiring books for the library and instead proceeded to take books out to send to france or to their own libraries 20720-1970 ( hey , why did n't the spaniards like the french kings ? currently , the library has over 40,000 volumes mafra national palace el escorial , madrid san lorenzo de el escorial , madrid list of early modern universities in europe list of world heritage sites in spain valle de los caídos golden age renaissance replicas of the jewish temple history of early modern period domes
