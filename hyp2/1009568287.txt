since nipples change throughout the life span in men and women , the anatomy of the nipple can change and this change may be expected and considered normal after the birth of the infant , the milk supply increases based upon the continuous and increasing stimulation of the nipple by the infant if the baby increases nursing time at the nipple , the mammary glands respond to this stimulation by increasing milk production sore nipples that progress to cracked nipples is of concern since many woman cease breastfeeding due to the pain one reason for the development of cracked and sore nipples is the incorrect latching-on of the infant to the nipple if a nipple appears to be wedge-shaped , white and flattened , this may indicates that the attachment of the infant is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples discharge from the nipples of men or boys may indicate a problem some cases of nipple discharge will clear on their own without treatment nipple discharge is most often not cancer ( benign ) , but rarely , it can be a sign of breast cancer here are some reasons for nipple discharge : pregnancy recent breastfeeding rubbing on the area from a bra or t-shirt injury to the breast infection inflammation and clogging of the breast ducts noncancerous pituitary tumors small growth in the breast that is usually not cancer severe underactive thyroid gland ( hypothyroidism ) fibrocystic breast ( normal lumpiness in the breast ) use of certain medicines use of certain herbs , such as anise and fennel widening of the milk ducts sometimes , babies can have nipple discharge cancers such as paget disease ( a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple ) can also cause nipple discharge any nipple discharge in a male usually is of more concern using a local anesthetic to numb the skin may not be necessary since a thin needle is used for the biopsy some men develop a condition known as gynecomastia , in which the breast tissue under the nipple develops and grows the nipple may swell in some men possibly due to increased levels of estrogen changes in appearance may be normal or related to disease often , scar tissue forms for no reason this change can be of concern since puckering or retraction of the nipple can indicate an underlying change in breast tissue that can be cancerous nipple is warm to the touch , red or painful - this can be an infection it is rarely due to breast cancer this is a rare form of breast cancer involving the nipple retracted nipples - the nipple was raised above the surface but changes , begins to pull inward , and does not come out when stimulated symptoms of breast cancer can often be seen first by changes of the nipple and areola , although not all women have the same symptoms , and some people do not have any signs or symptoms at all warning signs can be : new lump in the nipple , or breast or armpit thickening or swelling of part of the breast , areola , or nipple irritation or dimpling of breast skin redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area nipple discharge other than breast milk , including blood any change in the size or the shape of the breast or nipple pain in any area of the breast changes in the nipple are not necessarily symptoms or signs of breast cancer other conditions of the nipple can mimic the signs and symptoms of breast cancer most of the time , this infection is localized to the area of the nipple herpes infection of the nipple can go unnoticed because the lesions are small but usually are quite painful exposing the entire breast and nipple is a form of protest for some and a crime for others komisaruk 's study was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain ; it indicates that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina , clitoris and cervix , and that these reported orgasms are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation , and may be directly linked to the genital sensory cortex ( '' the genital area of the brain '' )
