lower levels of plasma sodium are associated with more severe symptoms however , mild hyponatremia ( plasma sodium levels at 131â€“135 & nbsp ; mmol/l ) may be associated with complications and subtle symptoms ( for example , increased falls , altered posture and gait , reduced attention , impaired cognition , and possibly higher rates of death ) neurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium ( usually when sodium levels in the blood become very low , water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell ( cerebral edema ) symptom severity depends on how fast and how severe the drop in blood sodium level is the specific causes of hyponatremia are generally divided into those with low tonicity ( lower than normal concentration of solutes ) , without low tonicity , and falsely low sodiums there is volume expansion in the body , no edema , but hyponatremia occurs siadh ( and its many causes ) hypothyroidism not enough acth beer potomania normal physiologic change of pregnancy reset osmostat any cause of hypovolemia such as prolonged vomiting , decreased oral intake , severe diarrhea diuretic use ( due to the diuretic causing a volume depleted state and thence adh release , and not a direct result of diuretic-induced urine sodium loss ) addison 's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones ( combined glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency ) pancreatitis prolonged exercise and sweating , combined with drinking water without electrolytes is the cause of exercise-associated hyponatremia ( eah ) miscellaneous causes that are not included under the above classification scheme include the following : false hyponatremia ( due to massive increases in blood triglyceride levels or extreme elevation of immunoglobulins as may occur in multiple myeloma ) hyponatremia with elevated tonicity can occur with high blood sugar hyponatremia occurs 1 ) when the hypothalamic-kidney feedback loop is overwhelmed by increased fluid intake , 2 ) the feedback loop malfunctions such that adh is always '' turned on '' , 3 ) the receptors in the kidney are always '' open '' regardless of there being no signal from adh to be open ; or 4 ) there is an increased adh even though there is no normal stimulus ( elevated serum sodium ) for adh to be increased each category represents a different underlying reason for the increase in adh that led to the water retention and thence hyponatremia : high volume hyponatremia , wherein there is decreased effective circulating volume ( less blood flowing in the body ) even though total body volume is increased ( by the presence of edema or swelling , especially in the ankles ) low volume hyponatremia , wherein adh secretion is stimulated by or associated with volume depletion ( not enough water in the body ) due to decreased effective circulating volume chronic hyponatremia is when sodium levels drop gradually over several days or weeks and symptoms and complications are typically moderate acute hyponatremia is when sodium levels drop rapidly , resulting in potentially dangerous effects , such as rapid brain swelling , which can result in coma and death how quickly treatment is required depends on a person 's symptoms a rapid rise in serum sodium is anticipated in certain groups when the cause of the hyponatremia is addressed thus warranting closer monitoring in order to avoid overly rapid correction of the blood sodium concentration options include : mild and asymptomatic hyponatremia is treated with adequate solute intake ( including salt and protein ) and fluid restriction starting at 500 ml per day of water with adjustments based on serum sodium levels there is tentative evidence that vasopressin receptor antagonists ( vaptans ) , such as conivaptan , may be slightly more effective than fluid restriction in those with high volume or normal volume hyponatremia they may also be used in people with chronic hyponatremia due to siadh that is insufficiently responsive to fluid restriction and/or sodium tablets in many people it has no benefit while in others it can result in overcorrection and high blood sodium levels
