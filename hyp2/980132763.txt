while the concepts of terminal ballistics can be applied to any projectile striking any target , much of the topic concerns the effects of small arms fire striking live targets and their ability to either incapacitate or kill them there are three basic classes of bullets : those designed for maximum accuracy at varying ranges those designed to maximize damage to a target by penetrating as deeply as possible those designed to avoid over-penetration of a target , by deforming to control the depth to which the bullet penetrates , which as a by-product , deals more damage inside the wound the third class may limit penetration by expanding or fragmenting a soft lead bullet , or a jacketed hollow-point bullet or soft-point bullet will flatten out on impact ( if the velocity at impact is sufficient to make it deform ) , spreading the impact over a larger area of the target , allowing more total force to be applied without damaging the steel target the matchking bullet ( which is still in wide use and holds many records ) is a hollow point design with a tiny aperture in the jacket at the point of the bullet and a hollow air space under the point of the bullet , where previous conventional bullets had a lead core that went all the way up to the point for use against armored targets , or large , tough game animals , penetration is the most important consideration military armor-piercing small arms ammunition is made from a copper-jacketed steel core ; the steel resists deformation better than the usual soft lead core leading to greater penetration the current nato 5.56mm ss109 ( m855 ) bullet uses a steel-tipped lead core to improve penetration , the steel tip providing resistance to deformation for armor piercing , and the heavier lead core ( 25 % heavier than the previous bullet , the m193 ) providing increased sectional density for better penetration in soft targets to get the maximum force on the smallest area , modern anti-tank rounds have aspect ratios of 10:1 or more a desirable side effect is that the expanded bullet makes a larger hole , increasing tissue damage and speeding incapacitation flat-point bullets , with fronts of up to 90 % of the overall bullet diameter , are usually designed for use against large or dangerous game these bullets are designed to penetrate deeply enough to reach vital organs from any shooting angle and at a far enough range more effective on lighter targets are the expanding bullets , the hollow point bullet and the soft point bullet the hollow point peels back into several connected pieces ( sometimes referred to as petals due to their appearance ) causing the bullet to create a larger area of permanent damage for the purposes of aerodynamic efficiency the tip of the hollowpoint will often be tipped with a pointed polymer 'nose ' which may also aid in expansion by functioning as a piston upon impact pushing the hollow point open penetration of the hollowpoint would be less than half that of a similar nonexpanding bullet , and the resulting wound or permanent cavity would be much wider a larger diameter bullet is going to have significantly more drag than a smaller diameter bullet of the same mass , which means long range performance will be significantly degraded a larger diameter bullet also means more space is required to store the ammunition , which means either bulkier guns or smaller magazine capacities especially where the military requirement of a nonexpanding round is concerned , there is fierce debate over whether it is better to have fewer , larger bullets for enhanced terminal effects , or more , smaller bullets for increased number of potential target hits this class of projectile is designed to break apart on impact whilst being of a construction more akin to that of an expanding bullet in contrast to a hollowpoint which attempts to stay in one large piece retaining as much weight as possible whilst presenting the most surface area to the target , a fragmenting bullet is intended to break up into many small pieces almost instantly this also limits practical use of these rounds to supersonic ( rifle ) rounds , which have a high enough kinetic energy to ensure a lethal hit the two main advantages of this ammunition are that it is very humane , as a hit almost anywhere on most small vermin will ensure an instant kill , and that the relatively low mass bullet fragments pose a very low risk of ricochet or of penetrating unintended secondary targets also used are bullets similar to hollowpoint bullets or soft point bullets whose cores and/or jackets are deliberately weakened to cause deformation or fragmentation upon impact on impact , the epoxy shatters and the copper shell opens up , the individual lead balls then spread out in a wide pattern , and due to their low mass to surface area ratio , stop very quickly by far the most common use of frangible ammunition is for training by shooting steel targets at close ranges , while one may be at risk of being injured by fragments of standard solid lead bullets at close ranges when shooting steel , the powder that frangible bullets disintegrate into upon impact poses a very low risk to the shooter this becomes irrelevant when shooting at longer ranges because it is unlikely that fragments created by the impact of any type of bullet on a steel target will travel more than 50-100yds , in these long range cases it is of more value to use bullets that fly identically to those to be used in real situations than to mitigate the possible risks of bullet fragments and ricochets so frangible bullets are typically not used some anti-armour projectiles use what is known as a shaped charge to defeat their target a disadvantage of using era is that each plate can protect against a single strike , and the resulting explosion can be extremely dangerous to nearby personnel and lightly armoured structures they also produce a much larger diameter hole in comparison to a shaped charge and hence produce a far more extensive behind armour effect
