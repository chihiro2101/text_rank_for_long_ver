vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because , as compared with conventional composting , it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly containing water-soluble nutrients , vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb because the earthworms grind and uniformly mix minerals in simple forms , plants need only minimal effort to obtain them as they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil , they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin some systems use a windrow , which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin ; organic material is added to it although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping , in theory they should not , due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population because red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source , the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging for vermicomposting at home , a large variety of bins are commercially available , or a variety of adapted containers may be used tsuga is another inexpensive and fairly rot-resistant wood species that may be used to build worm bins small-scale vermicomposting is well-suited to turn kitchen waste into high-quality soil amendments , where space is limited worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort ( turning the bin ) that composting requires it is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems ( which can have high heat capacity properties ) , as the raw materials or feedstocks used can compost , heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms there are several methods of harvesting from small-scale systems : '' dump and hand sort '' , '' let the worms do the sorting '' , '' alternate containers '' and '' divide and dump in this process , compost is separated into large clumps , which is placed back into composting for further breakdown , and lighter compost , with which the rest of the process continues however , in one study it has been found that homemade backyard vermicompost was lower in microbial biomass , soil microbial activity , and yield of a species of ryegrass than municipal compost unlike other compost , worm castings also contain mucus which helps prevent nutrients from washing away with the first watering and holds moisture better than plain soil 111 plant growth enhances germination , plant growth , and crop yield it helps in root and plant growth enriches soil with micro-organisms ( adding plant hormones such as auxins and gibberellic acid ) economic biowastes conversion reduces waste flow to landfills elimination of biowastes from the waste stream reduces contamination of other recyclables collected in a single bin ( a common problem in communities practicing single-stream recycling ) creates low-skill jobs at local level low capital investment and relatively simple technologies make vermicomposting practical for less-developed agricultural regions environmental helps to close the '' metabolic gap '' through recycling waste on-site large systems often use temperature control and mechanized harvesting , however other equipment is relatively simple and does not wear out quickly production reduces greenhouse gas emissions such as methane and nitric oxide ( produced in landfills or incinerators when not composted ) vermicompost can be mixed directly into the soil , or mixed with water to make a liquid fertilizer known as worm tea if decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin , or the layers of food waste have become too deep , the bin will begin to smell of ammonia if decomposition has become anaerobic , to restore healthy conditions and prevent the worms from dying , excess waste water must be reduced and the bin returned to a normal moisture level to do this , first reduce addition of food scraps with a high moisture content and second , add fresh , dry bedding such as shredded newspaper to your bin , mixing it in well pests such as rodents and flies are attracted by certain materials and odors , usually from large amounts of kitchen waste , particularly meat maintaining the correct ph ( close to neutral ) and water content of the bin ( just enough water where squeezed bedding drips a couple of drops ) can help avoid these pests as well in order to avoid over-fertilization issues , such as nitrogen burn , vermicompost can be diluted as a tea 50:50 with water , or as a solid can be mixed in 50:50 with potting soil this also reduces the risk of burning the plants , as is common with the use and overuse of commercial fertilizers
