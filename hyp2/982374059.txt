the rgl would have been the first system in the netherlands where light rail vehicles shared heavy rail tracks with heavy rail trains , similar to the tram-train systems around karlsruhe and saarbr√ºcken , germany for leiden , the plan was to have new track through the centre ( breestraat ) at street level ( alternatives that were proposed were around the centre on existing track , or in a tunnel through the centre ) the proposed line passed through leiden centraal railway station and then used the new tracks to katwijk with a branch to noordwijk the tram system was initially intended to be a much larger light rail network , with branches to leiderdorp , the district of ridderfeld in alphen and schiphol the critics were in favour of extending the rail line from leiden to utrecht , and investment in dedicated bus lanes on the route from leiden to katwijk and noordwijk a track through the centre of leiden would mean that the travel time for people who have a destination outside leiden would be significantly longer , and this course had repercussions for the passenger forecast on the route leiden-katwijk/noordwijk the number of passengers would only be slightly higher than on the current bus network the future rgl would then continue to leiden lammenschans railway station the original plan was that the rgl should continue from leiden lammenschans railway station as a city tram to leiden central station in one of those alternatives the rgl would follow the existing route of the railway line all the way to leiden centraal , or to a point near the station the railway would be doubled , and perhaps be moved to a concrete overpass above the current track these alternative plans were shown to be three to four times more expensive than the originally proposed route through the city centre whereas the tram in the initial proposal would go through steenstraat/3e binnenvestgracht stationsweg to the station , it was to go through the lammermarkt and schuttersveld according to the last urban vision , the tram would cross the railway in the rijnsbruger tunnel instead of the joop walenkamp tunnel , implying the removal of the bicycle lane and taxi stop in 2005 , an agreement was signed between all municipalities except the municipality of leiden to share the costs of the project , with the national government and province covering a large part of the construction cost , and the county bearing all risks for the operation of the line in both communities the tram line would have to be imposed by the provincial government , as had happened earlier in leiden in march 2003 test traffic was started between gouda and alphen aan den rijn with light rail equipment on existing rail tracks , largely using rgl vehicles in august 2009 it was announced that the proposed precursor of the rgl on the gouda-alphen route would disappear as of 13 december 2009 , because using only sprinter the train timetables could be improved a more direct train service between gouda and leiden centraal was introduced , decreasing the travel time by 8 minutes
