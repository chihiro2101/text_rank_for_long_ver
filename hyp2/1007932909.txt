one recent study of chariton 's vocabulary favours a date in the late 1st century or early 2nd century ad '' who died in ad 62 ; if this is chariton 's novel , then a relatively early date would be indicated regardless , chariton probably wrote before the other greek novelists whose works survive , making either his work or petronius ' satyricon the earliest extant european novel the story is set against a historical background of ca 400 bc she is the daughter of hermocrates , a hero of the peloponnesian war and the most important political figure of syracuse , thus setting the narrative in time and social milieu several characters from callirhoe can be identified with figures from history , although their portrayal is not always historically accurate the hero chaereas is not a historical figure , although his name recalls chabrias , an athenian general who fought in an egyptian revolt against persia in about 360 bc despite the liberties chariton took with historical fact , he clearly aimed to place his story in a period well before his own lifetime tomas h√§gg has argued that this choice of setting makes the work an important forerunner of the modern historical novel much of the novel is told in direct speech , revealing the importance of oratory and rhetorical display ( as in the presentation before the king of persia ) and perhaps as well the influence of new comedy
