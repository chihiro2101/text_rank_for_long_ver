when an external electrical field ( arrows ) is applied , the electrons ( little balls ) in the metal move to the left side of the cage , giving it a negative charge , while the remaining unbalanced charge of the nuclei give the right side a positive charge these induced charges create an opposing electric field that cancels the external electric field throughout the box if a charge is placed inside an ungrounded faraday shield without touching the walls ( let 's denote this charge quantity as +q ) , the internal face of the shield becomes charged with -q , leading to field lines originating at the charge and extending to charges inside the inner surface of the metal so for all intents and purposes , the faraday shield generates the same static electric field on the outside that it would generate if the metal were simply charged with +q see faraday 's ice pail experiment , for example , for more details on electric field lines and the decoupling of the outside from the inside if the cage is grounded , the excess charges will be neutralized as the ground connection creates an equipotential bonding between the outside of the cage and the environment , so there is no voltage between them and therefore also no field thumb effectiveness of shielding of a static electric field is largely independent of the geometry of the conductive material ; however , static magnetic fields can penetrate the shield completely faraday cages may therefore be thought of as high pass filters faraday cages are routinely used in analytical chemistry to reduce noise while making sensitive measurements faraday cages , more specifically dual paired seam faraday bags , are often used in digital forensics to prevent remote wiping and alteration of criminal digital evidence small , physical faraday cages are used by electronics engineers during equipment testing to simulate such an environment to make sure that the device gracefully handles these conditions some electrical linemen wear faraday suits , which allow them to work on live , high-voltage power lines without risk of electrocution
