due to the loss of archives in 1695 and again in 1940 , there are few certain facts of van der weyden 's life little is known about rogier 's training as a painter it is known that the city council of tournai offered eight pitchers of wine in honour of a certain 'maistre rogier de le pasture ' on 17 november 1426 however , on 5 march of the following year , the records of the painters ' guild show a '' rogelet de le pasture '' entered the workshop of robert campin together with jacques daret records show that de le pasture was already established as a painter clarke , 44 only five years later , on the first of august 1432 , de le pasture obtained the title of a '' master '' ( maistre ) painter in general , the close stylistic link between the documented works of jacques daret and the paintings attributed to robert campin and van der weyden are the main arguments to consider rogier van der weyden as a pupil of campin at the same time , the first mention of rogier de weyden places him as the official painter of brussels it is this fact that puts de la pasture and van der weyden as one and the same painter the post of city painter was created especially for van der weyden and was meant to lapse on his death after interventions from both the duke of burgundy and the dauphin of france , the future louis & nbsp ; xi , rogier van der weyden was persuaded to accept the request of bianca maria visconti , duchess of milan , that her court painter zanetto bugatto go to brussels to become an apprentice in his workshop no single work can be attributed with certainty to van der weyden on 15th-century documentary evidence alone campbell & van der stock , 2009 , 32–64 the best documented is the descent from the cross in the museo del prado , madrid a copy of the masterpiece by michel coxcie was donated to the people of leuven to replace the original sent to spain campbell ( 2004 ) , 19 châtelet illustrates how subsequent generations of art historians have conflated and confused rogier van der weyden 's identity , thereby mis-attributing works of art van mander , who knew that rogier van der weyden resided in brussels , read vasari 's text and believed that there were two different artists with the same name , who both appear separately in his schilder-boeck of 1604 châtelet explains how the brussels archivist alphonse walters discovered in 1846 that there was a rogier van der weyden who lived in brussels but that he had died earlier than stated in the schilder-boeck ; this led alfred michiels to claim that there were two rogier van der weyden painters , a father and son a further complication arose at the end of the 19th century when william bode and hugo von tschudi attributed a group of works of art to the '' maître de flémalle '' ; despite discrepancies , these works are similar to those of van der weyden and so it was believed that these works were in fact by rogier and that he was the '' maître de flémalle '' there was still a divide in critical opinion over whether there was one rogier van der weyden or two artists , the other being rogier de la pasture of tournai , until erwin panofsky wrote his definitive work in 1953 early netherlandish painting and established that there was only one painter with two names relatively few works are attributed to van der weyden 's relatively long career , but this does not mean he was un-prolific , more that it is likely that many have been lost he is first mentioned in historical records in 1427 when , relatively late in life , he studied painting under campin during 1427–32 , and soon outshone his master and , later , even influenced him some of his work from this period was attributed to 'rogelet de la pasture ' after his apprenticeship , he was made master of the tournai guild of st luke he completed his deposition in 1435 , which as he had deliberately intended , made him one of the most sought after and influential artists in northern europe and is still considered his masterpiece the fragment of the london national gallery 's the magdalen reading has been described by campbell as '' one of the great masterpieces of fifteenth-century art and among rogier 's most important early works '' panofsky writes how rogier van der weyden introduced new religious iconography in his painting ; he depicted patrons participating in sacred events and combined half-portraits of the madonna with portraits of people in prayer to form diptychs van der weyden had also a large influence on the german painter and engraver martin schongauer whose prints were distributed all over europe from the last decades of the 15th century 1450 ) , oil on oak panel , 45 × 35 & nbsp ;
