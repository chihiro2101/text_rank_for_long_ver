we state quite clearly and categorically that this responsibility now rests with the government and its institutions where legitimacy resides '' '' northern ireland 's outlawed ulster defence association says it has fully disarmed '' the canadian press shaun woodward , the british secretary of state for northern ireland , stated that this '' is a major act of leadership by the uda and further comprehensive evidence of the success of politics over violence in northern ireland '' and the act was also welcomed by sinn féin and dup politicians this area also continues to use the '' uda '' title in its name , although it too expressed willingness to move towards '' community development the new ulster political research group ( nuprg ) was initially the political wing of the uda , founded in 1978 , which then evolved into the ulster loyalist democratic party in 1981 under the leadership of john mcmichael , a prominent uda member killed by the ira in 1987 , amid suspicion that he was set up to be killed by some of his uda colleagues in 1987 , the uda 's deputy commander john mcmichael ( who was then the leader of the uff ) promoted a document entitled common sense , which promoted a consensual end to the conflict in northern ireland , while maintaining the union however , the killing of mcmichael that same year and the subsequent removal of tyrie from the leadership and his replacement with an inner council saw the uda concentrate on stockpiling weapons rather than political ideas the ulster political research group ( uprg ) was subsequently formed to give political analysis to the uda and act as community workers in loyalist areas in early january 1994 , the uda released a document calling for ethnic cleansing and repartition , with the goal of making northern ireland wholly protestant the '' doomsday plan '' was based on the work of dr liam kennedy , a lecturer at queen 's university belfast who in 1986 had published a book called two ulsters : a case for repartition although it did not call for ethnic cleansing the dup 's sammy wilson stated that the plan '' shows that some loyalist paramilitaries are looking ahead and contemplating what needs to be done to maintain our separate ulster identity '' in his book black sun , nicholas goodrick-clarke claimed that the uda had links with neo-nazi groups in britain—specifically combat 18 goodrick-clarke , nicholas ian s wood 's book crimes of loyalty : a history of the uda claims that the uda has received backing from combat 18 , the british national front and the british national party on one occasion the uda sent louis scott , one of a few black members of the uda , to make the transaction the relationship between the uda ( specifically adair 's west belfast brigade , not the wider leadership of the uda ) was initially formed after the death of billy wright , the previous leader of the lvf , and grew from adair 's personal friendship with mark 'swinger ' fulton , the organisation 's new chief it was perceived that any open co-operation between the uda and the lvf would anger the uvf , something which proved to be the case in following years and resulted in a loyalist feud there has been debate as to whether or not the red hand defenders have become an entity in their own right made up of dissident factions from both the uda and the lvf ( both of which have now declared ceasefires whilst the rhd has not ) , although much intelligence has been based on the claims of responsibility which , as has been suggested , are frequently misleading six members received particularly lengthy prison sentences for their involvement in uda activities in perth and the scottish brigade quietly disappeared johnny 'mad dog ' adair—west belfast ( 1990–2002 ) an active figure in the uda/uff , adair rose to notoriety in the early 1990s when he led the 2nd battalion , c company unit in west belfast which was responsible for one of the bloodiest killing sprees of the troubles an unlikely figure in northern ireland loyalism , the openly bi-sexual gray was a controversial figure in the organisation until his death on 4 october 2005 malcolm sutton 's index of deaths from the conflict in ireland , part of the conflict archive on the internet ( cain ) , states that the uda/uff was responsible for at least 260 killings , and lists a further 256 loyalist killings that have not yet been attributed to a particular group 1551–54 of those killed by the uda/uff : 209 ( ~80 % ) were civilians , 12 of whom were civilian political activists 11 ( ~4 % ) were members or former members of republican paramilitary groups 37 ( ~14 % ) were members or former members of loyalist paramilitary groups 3 ( ~1 % ) were members of the british security forces the cain database says there were 91 uda members and four former members killed in the conflict .
