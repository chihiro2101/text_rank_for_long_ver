the current complex is a combination of two building complexes and a standalone building : the original 14 art deco office buildings from the 1930s , one building across 51st street built in 1947 , and a set of four international-style towers built along the west side of avenue of the americas during the 1960s and 1970s the east side of sixth avenue , officially known as avenue of the americas , contains most of the buildings that were built specifically for the proposed radio complex the last structure in the original complex to be built , it was topped out in november 1939 the 23-story building contains two 7-story wings on its north and south sides the 19-story annex , designed by wallace harrison and max abramovitz , had a glass facade on the lowest two stories—reflecting the design of the former american airlines building across sixth avenue—and a limestone facade above the second story the 3,700-seat center theatre had a short massing ( general shape ) in place due to height restrictions at the time , which prohibited construction above theater auditoriums the 70-floor , building anchors the entire complex , and is located on the eastern side of the block 30 rockefeller plaza was built as a single structure occupying the entire block between sixth avenue and rockefeller plaza , and its design was influenced by john todd 's desire for the building to use its air rights to their maximum potential it has three main segments : the 66-story tower rising from the eastern part of the base with the famous rainbow room restaurant on the 65th floor , and , formerly , the rockefeller family office ; a windowless segment in the middle of the base that houses nbc studios ; and a shorter 16-story tower on the western part of the base at 1250 avenue of the americas henry hofmeister designed the building , as well as several other office buildings in the city that were built over theaters the building 's entrance design , blending in with that of the other buildings in the radio city section , is marked by three sculptural bas-reliefs created by robert garrison for each of the building 's three bays , signifying muses of contemporary thought , morning , and evening the international complex is located entirely along fifth avenue , with the tall international building overshadowing four smaller country-themed buildings with retail outlets three of the buildings—the tall tower and the two southern retail buildings—were planned after the cancellation of the incongruously designed oval retail building in 1931 , while the two retail buildings to the north were added later it is a six-story standalone building with a limestone facade with a sixth-story setback , as well as a partial -story penthouse on the west half of the seventh story and a garden on the east side of the seventh-story roof one of two skyscrapers that opened in manhattan in 1935 , it was noted for its short 136-day duration of construction , as well as the construction quality , overall design , and materials used the palazzo d'italia and international building north serve as six-story retail wings of the international building the 36-story tower at 1 rockefeller plaza , on the east side of the plaza between 48th and 49th streets , is the original time & life building that was opened in april 1937 had moved into 1271 avenue of the americas , the new time-life building located three blocks away its planning name was the holland house , but the dutch government did not sign on , so the building became the eastern air lines building instead the only building in the center built to the outer limits of its lot line , the 15-story building took its shape from associated press 's need for a single , undivided , loft-like newsroom as large as the lot could accommodate—namely , a blocky structure with no setbacks the 28-story tower was once also known as the sinclair oil building and the manufacturers hanover trust company building carson and lundin designed 600 fifth avenue , along with 666 fifth avenue three blocks north , to complement the rockefeller complex between the two towers the building contains a main lobby at 48th street , a service entrance to the same street , and a connection to 1 rockefeller plaza at its west end unlike other buildings in the complex , 600 fifth avenue 's ground level only contained one public entrance to maximize the ground-floor retail space , which was originally leased by swiss interests and pan am airlines the first subsequent building to be built was 75 rockefeller plaza , at 51st street on the north end of the complex , was built in 1947 the 33-story , building was originally called the esso building the other four buildings were built as part of a single project on the west side of sixth avenue between 47th and 51st streets the following buildings are part of the newer sixth avenue expansion : 1211 avenue of the americas , the former celanese building , is located between 47th and 48th streets 1271 avenue of the americas , the former time & life building , is located between 50th and 51st streets at the front of 30 rock is the lower plaza , located in the very center of the complex and below ground level originally , the plaza would have been located at ground level with a promenade called channel gardens , which led westward from fifth avenue to the plaza the flags later became permanent installations , fitting in with the nearby international complex pei praised rockefeller center 's lower plaza as being '' perhaps the most successful open space in the united states , perhaps in the world '' , due to its success in drawing visitors the plaza has also inspired similar developments around the world this street was also part of the original plans for the metropolitan opera , and benjamin morris originally intended for the road to stretch from 42nd to 59th streets the road was given the name '' rockefeller plaza '' in 1933 , despite the potential confusion with the lower plaza , because it was believed that the '' plaza '' in the road 's name would emphasize its '' spatial unity '' with the lower plaza and channel gardens the original intention of the street 's construction was to enhance the shopping district of fifth avenue , to its east , but this never happened , and rockefeller plaza now primarily serves as a pedestrian passage that connects all of rockefeller center 's separate components the surface of rockefeller plaza outside radio city music hall , between 50th and 51st street , contains small bronze circles for theatergoers to stand on while waiting to enter the hall since rockefeller plaza is technically a purely private property to which the public is welcome , the plaza is closed for part of one day every year they came about because both hood and todd believed that rooftop gardens would enhance the complex 's beauty ; in particular , hood compared the presence of rooftop gardens to the plants around a house however , after hood 's death in 1935 , the garden plan fell apart , as most of the complex 's final buildings were built without provisions for gardens the associated press building 's 15th-story roof , as well as the isolated location of the international building and the high cost of these gardens , made this system infeasible ultimately , gardens were installed on 10 rockefeller plaza ; 30 rockefeller plaza ; the four international-themed retail buildings ; the center theatre ; and radio city music hall the largest and most grand of the gardens was the '' garden of the nations '' ( alternatively '' gardens of the nations '' ) , which was installed on the eleventh-floor roof of 30 rockefeller plaza and opened in april 1935 the italian garden also contained a cobblestone walkway and two plaques from the roman forum , while international building north 's garden has a paved walkway with steps the roof gardens of the international building 's wings were restored in 1986 for 48,000 each , followed by the gardens on the british and french buildings , which were restored the next year ultimately , the people mover was not built , but the 25-space mall opened in may 1935 robert walton goelet owned a lot at 2–6 west 49th street and wished to develop it ; the lot was developed as 608 fifth avenue , which was completed in 1932 in november 1931 , john todd suggested the creation of a program for placing distinctive artworks within each of the buildings in an expansion of hood 's setback-garden plan , alexander 's proposal also included rooftop gardens atop all the buildings , which would create a '' babylonian garden '' when viewed from above sculptor lee lawrie contributed the largest number of individual pieces & nbsp ; – twelve , including the atlas statue facing fifth avenue and the conspicuous friezes of wisdom above the main entrance to 30 rockefeller plaza see : one of the center 's more controversial works was man at the crossroads , created by diego rivera , which was originally commissioned for 30 rockefeller plaza 's lobby but was demolished before it could be completed even mumford praised the complex , lamenting in 1947 that the new headquarters of the united nations on first avenue had no '' human scale '' or '' transition from the intimate to the monumental '' , whereas rockefeller center 's buildings '' produce an aesthetic effect out of all proportion to their size '' '' the new york state office of parks , recreation and historic preservation commissioned a report in 1974 entitled '' grand central terminal and rockefeller center : a historic-critical estimate of their significance '' , in which they concluded that rockefeller center , along with central park and grand central terminal , were the only three developments that could slow down manhattan 's '' remorseless process of expansion and decay ''
