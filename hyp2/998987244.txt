prior to the adoption of the rules by the united states house of representatives , the house operates under general parliamentary rules and jefferson 's manual but these are not binding on the current house until they are approved by the membership of the current congress while on the floor of the house of representatives , members are bound by a number of rules on their behavior at the beginning of the legislative business day , after the prayer , approval of the previous day 's journal , and pledge of allegiance , the speaker of the house may recognize members for one-minute speeches the rules of the house do not specifically provide for one-minute speeches , rather they have evolved as a unanimous consent practice of the chamber , where members must ask for unanimous consent to address the chamber one-minute speeches have many uses in congress , including allowing members to explain a new bill or a floor amendment they will offer later in the day the speaker designates one of these committees as a '' primary committee '' with primary jurisdiction and responsibility for the bill and all other committee ( s ) are considered '' additional committees '' and the speaker may impose time limits on these committee ( s ) if he or she deems it appropriate and traditionally does so if the primary committee has reported out a version of the bill to the full house upon being reported out of committee or removed from committee by the house , a bill will be added to the house calendar and any rules setting out how much time is allowed for debate , or other matters may be passed by the house in the form of a resolution if amendments are permitted under the rules governing floor action on the bill they are debated and voted upon at the time of the amendment ( although common practice usually permits the house to debate several amendments without immediately voting on them , then voting back-to-back at the end of the series of amendments , which can either be voice votes or recorded votes ) after the conclusion of time for debate and after all amendments have been disposed of , the matter is usually voted upon by the full house , unless the rules permit and a member moves to recommit ( or commit ) the bill back to committee committees play an important role in the legislative process by providing members the opportunity to study , debate and amend the bill and the public with the opportunity to make comments on the bill there are three types of house committees , these are : 1 ) standing committees elected by members of the house , 2 ) select committees appointed by the speaker of the house , and 3 ) joint committees whose members are chosen according to the statute or resolution that created that committee after the committee conducts any necessary research , and has debated and voted on any amendments that were offered in committee they may take one of three actions the house may under certain rules remove the bill or measure from committee ( see discharge petition ) if the committee fails to report the measure to the house rules committee or to the full house and a negative report to the full house does not terminate the bill the phrase that a '' bill has been killed in committee '' is not completely accurate as the full house always has options under the rules to remove the bill from committee and to take action standing committees are established at the time that the rules of the house are adopted or by amending the house rules rules of party nominations may therefore differ but approval by the house of these nominations is conducted according to house rules seniority on a standing committee is based on the order of the members on the election resolution as approved by the house the number of members who serve on a committee along with the party ratio of a committee is determined by the majority and minority leaders of the house with the exception of the committee on ethics which is limited by the rules to 5 majority members and 5 minority members also , a committee chairman along with the ranking member generally control the time each receives on the house floor respective to a bill that originated or was reported out of their committee
