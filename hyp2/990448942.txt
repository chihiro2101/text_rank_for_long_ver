he was sent first to the bacton village school , kept by john woodrow , and then to that of happisburgh , kept by mr summers , where his extraordinary powers of memory and aptitude for arithmetic were discovered his literary skill was partly due to the efforts of summers , who long afterwards stated that in fifty years of scholastic life he had never come across boys so clever as porson and his two brothers for books he had only what his father 's cottage supplied – a book or two of arithmetic , james greenwood 's an essay towards a practical english grammar , jewell 's apology , an odd volume of the chambers ' cyclopaedia picked up from a wrecked coaster , and eight or ten volumes of the universal magazine mr hewitt taught him with his own boys , taking him through julius caesar , terence , ovid and virgil ; he had already made great progress in mathematics porson did not care for eton , but he was popular there ; two dramas he wrote for performance in long chamber ( the scholars ' dormitory ) were remembered what first set his mind towards literary criticism was the gift of a copy of jonathan toup 's longinus by the headmaster of eton ; but it was richard bentley and richard dawes to whom he looked as his immediate masters he also began a correspondence with david ruhnken , the veteran scholar of leiden , requesting fragments of aeschylus that ruhnken had come across in his collection of unpublished lexicons and grammarians , and sending him his restoration of a corrupt passage in the supplices ( 673–677 ) , with the help of a nearly equally corrupt passage of plutarch 's eroticus he was especially anxious that the medicean manuscript at florence should be collated for the new edition , and offered to undertake the collation ; but the syndics refused the offer , the vice-chancellor john torkington , master of clare hall ( the then name of clare college ) , observing that porson might collect his manuscripts at home the following year porson wrote his notae breves ad toupii emendationes in suidam , though this treatise did not appear until 1790 in the new edition of jonathan toup 's book published at oxford these first made porson 's name known as a scholar and carried his fame beyond england during 1787 he wrote three letters on john hawkins 's life of johnson for the gentleman 's magazine , which were reprinted by thomas kidd in his tracts and criticisms of porson , and in a volume of porson 's correspondence edward gibbon 's verdict on the book was that it was '' the most acute and accurate piece of criticism since the days of bentley '' but it was then the unpopular side : the publisher is said to have lost money on the book ; and one of his early friends , mrs turner of norwich , cut down a legacy she had left porson to £30 on being told that he had written a book against the bible he gave assistance to william beloe in one or two articles in the british critic , and probably wrote also in the analytical review and the critical review this last he twice transcribed ( the first transcript was destroyed by a fire at james perry 's house ) from the original among the gale manuscripts in the library of trinity college , cambridge it was at once recognised as porson 's work ; he had superintended the printing of a small edition in two octavo volumes , but this was kept back by the printer and not issued till 1806 , still without the editor 's name porson at first took no notice of either , but went on with his euripides , publishing the orestes in 1798 , the phoenissae in 1799 and the medea in 1801 , the last printed at the cambridge press , and with the editor 's name on the title page porson lived six years after the second edition of the hecuba was published , but he put off the work his library was divided into two parts , one of which was sold by auction , while the other , containing the transcript of the gale photius , his books with his notes , and some letters from foreign scholars , was bought by trinity college for 1000 guineas for the first thirty years of the 19th century , he was often regarded as the author of a very popular poem , the devil 's thoughts ( later entitled the devil 's walk )
