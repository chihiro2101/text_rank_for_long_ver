william vennard describes this process as follows : in the modal register , the vocal folds ( when viewed with a stroboscope ) are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration , closing the gap between them fully , if just for a very short time in falsetto , however , the vocal folds are seen to be blown apart and in untrained falsetto singers a permanent oval orifice is left in the middle between the edges of the two folds through which a certain volume of air escapes continuously as long as the register is engaged ( the singer is singing using the voice ) research has revealed that not all speakers and singers produce falsetto in exactly the same way one possible explanation for this failure to recognize the female falsetto sooner is that when men phonate in the falsetto register there is a much more pronounced change in timbre and dynamic level between the modal and falsetto registers than there is in female voices others refused to accept the idea , and opposition to the concept of female falsetto has continued among some teachers of singing long after scientific evidence had proven the existence of female falsetto mckinney , who expressed alarm that many books on the art of singing completely ignore or gloss over the issue of female falsetto or insist that women do not have falsetto , argues that many young female singers substitute falsetto for the upper portion of the modal voice he believes that this failure to recognize the female falsetto voice has led to the misidentification of young contraltos and mezzo-sopranos as sopranos , as it is easier for these lower voice types to sing in the soprano tessitura using their falsetto register use of falsetto voice in western music is very old there is a difference between the modern usage of the '' head voice '' term and its previous meaning in the renaissance as a type of falsetto , according to many singing professionals these days , head voice is typically defined as a mix of chest and head voice , therefore created a stronger sound than falsetto '' in opera , it is believed that the chest voice , middle voice and head voice occur in women although , in contemporary teaching , some teachers no longer talk of the middle voice , choosing to call it the head voice as with men falsetto is not generally counted by classical purists as a part of the vocal range of anyone except countertenors there are exceptions , however , such as the baryton-martin which uses falsetto ( see baritone article ) in the absence of modern vocal training to hold back the volume of modal voice , in this overlapping area a given pitch in modal voice will be louder than the same pitch sung in falsetto the type of vocal cord vibration that produces the falsetto voice precludes loud singing except in the highest tones of that register ; it also limits the available tone colors because of the simplicity of its waveform falsetto , however , does involve less physical effort by the singer than the modal voice and , when properly used , can make possible some desirable tonal effects the falsetto voice has a number of highly specialized uses within a musical context the use of falsetto is considered uncommon in normal western speech and is most often employed within the context of humor pitch changes ranging to falsetto are also characteristic of british english
