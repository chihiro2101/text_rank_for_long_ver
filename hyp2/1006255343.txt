the concept of virtual particles arises in the perturbation theory of quantum field theory , an approximation scheme in which interactions ( in essence , forces ) between actual particles are calculated in terms of exchanges of virtual particles by expressing the interaction in terms of the exchange of a virtual particle with four-momentum , where is given by the difference between the four-momenta of the particles entering and leaving the interaction vertex , both momentum and energy are conserved at the interaction vertices of the feynman diagram the calculation of scattering amplitudes in theoretical particle physics requires the use of some rather large and complicated integrals over a large number of variables thus , it is natural to associate the other lines in the diagram with particles as well , called the '' virtual particles '' for example , if the solid lines were to correspond to electrons interacting by means of the electromagnetic interaction , the dotted line would correspond to the exchange of a virtual photon thus , although the virtual particles themselves are not directly observable in the laboratory , they do leave an observable effect : their zero-point energy results in forces acting on suitably arranged metal plates or dielectrics in an accelerating frame of reference , the virtual particles may appear to be actual to the accelerating observer ; this is known as the unruh effect if , for example , a pair of atomic nuclei are merged to very briefly form a nucleus with a charge greater than about 140 , ( that is , larger than about the inverse of the fine structure constant , which is a dimensionless quantity ) , the strength of the electric field will be such that it will be energetically favorable to create positron-electron pairs out of the vacuum or dirac sea , with the electron attracted to the nucleus to annihilate the positive charge for this reason , virtual particles & ndash ; which exist only temporarily as they are exchanged between ordinary particles & ndash ; do not typically obey the mass-shell relation ; the longer a virtual particle exists , the more the energy and momentum approach the mass-shell relation
