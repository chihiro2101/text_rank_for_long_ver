many of the exchanges encountered in the supply chain are therefore between different companies that seek to maximize their revenue within their sphere of interest but may have little or no knowledge or interest in the remaining players in the supply chain more recently , the loosely coupled , self-organizing network of businesses who cooperate to provide product and service offerings has been called the extended enterprise , and the use of the term '' chain '' and the linear structure it appears to represent have been criticised as '' harder to relate has developed the jsi framework for integrated supply chain management in public health , which draws from commercial sector best practices to solve problems in public health supply chains in the 1980s , the term supply-chain management ( scm ) was developed to express the need to integrate the key business processes , from end user through original suppliers the basic idea behind scm is that companies and corporations involve themselves in a supply chain by exchanging information about market fluctuations and production capabilities demand management using responsive pricing and product variety in the presence of supply chain disruptions : working paper , smu cox school of business if all relevant information is accessible to any relevant company , every company in the supply chain has the ability to help optimize the entire supply chain rather than to sub-optimize based on local optimization the primary objective of scm is to fulfill customer demands through the most efficient use of resources , including distribution capacity , inventory , and labor the term '' logistics '' applies to activities within one company or organization involving product distribution , whereas '' supply chain '' additionally encompasses manufacturing and procurement , and therefore has a much broader focus as it involves multiple enterprises ( including suppliers , manufacturers , and retailers ) working together to meet a customer need for a product or service wieland and handfield ( 2013 ) suggest that companies need to audit products and suppliers and that supplier auditing needs to go beyond direct relationships with first-tier suppliers ( those who supply the main customer directly ) as a result , supply chains are often subject to global and local regulations with increasing globalization and easier access to alternative products in today 's markets , the importance of product design to generating demand is more significant than ever in addition , as supply , and therefore competition , among companies for the limited market demand increases and as pricing and other marketing elements become less distinguishing factors , product design likewise plays a different role by providing attractive features to generate demand but product design affects not only demand generation but also manufacturing processes , cost , quality , and lead time the product design affects the associated supply chain and its requirements directly , including manufacturing , transportation , quality , quantity , production schedule , material selection , production technologies , production policies , regulations , and laws broadly , the success of the supply chain depends on the product design and the capabilities of the supply chain , but the reverse is also true : the success of the product depends on the supply chain that produces it since the product design dictates multiple requirements on the supply chain , as mentioned previously , then once a product design is completed , it drives the structure of the supply chain , limiting the flexibility of engineers to generate and evaluate different ( and potentially more cost-effective ) supply-chain alternatives
