an example of the breadth and types of agriculture policy concerns can be found in the australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics article '' agricultural economies of australia and new zealand '' which says that the major challenges and issues faced by their industrial agriculture industry are : marketing challenges and consumer tastes international trading environment ( world market conditions , barriers to trade , quarantine and technical barriers , maintenance of global competitiveness and market image , and management of biosecurity issues affecting imports and the disease status of exports ) biosecurity ( pests and diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) , avian influenza , foot and mouth disease , citrus canker , and sugarcane smut ) infrastructure ( such as transport , ports , telecommunications , energy and irrigation facilities ) management skills and labor supply ( with increasing requirements for business planning , enhanced market awareness , the use of modern technology such as computers and global positioning systems and better agronomic management , modern farm managers will need to become increasingly skilled in addition , a recent natural resource perspective paper by the overseas development institute found that good infrastructure , education and effective information services in rural areas were necessary to improve the chances of making agriculture work for the poor the spread of h5n1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines fmd occurs throughout much of the world , and while some countries have been free of fmd for some time , its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern farmers around the world can lose huge amounts of money during a foot-and-mouth epidemic , when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down for countries with free roaming wildlife it is nearly impossible to prove that they are entirely free of this disease in effect , many poor tropical countries have no chance to meet current rules , so they are still today banned from exporting meat , even if many of them are fmd-free the export ban then destroys the value of these animals , in effect destroying the most important coping mechanism of several hundreds of millions extremely poor households the rules around meat exports have been changed many times , always to accommodate changing circumstances in rich countries , usually further reducing meat export chances for poor countries in countries with new outbreaks , eradication programs that are started soon after the disease has been discovered have been successful ; such programs rely on the destruction of affected orchards the united nations food and agriculture organization ( fao ) defines food security as existing when '' all people , at all times , have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life '' as the global population grows to 9 billion by 2050 , and as diets shift to emphasize higher energy products and greater overall consumption , food systems will be subjected to even greater pressure climate change presents additional threats to food security , affecting crop yields , distribution of pests and diseases , weather patterns , and growing seasons around the world food security has thus become an increasingly important topic in agricultural policy as decision makers attempt to reduce poverty and malnutrition while augmenting adaptive capacity to climate change the commission on sustainable agriculture and climate change listed high-priority policy actions to address food security , including integrating food security and sustainable agriculture into global and national policies , significantly raising the level of global investment in food systems , and developing specific programs and policies to support the most vulnerable populations ( namely , those that are already subject to food insecurity ) 'food sovereignty ' , a term coined by members of via campesina in 1996 , '' global small-scale farmers ' movement developing new trade regimes '' , food first news & views , volume 28 , number 97 spring/summer 2005 , p.2 advocates of food sovereignty put the people who produce , distribute , and consume food at the centre of decisions on food systems and policies , rather than the demands of markets and corporations that they believe have come to dominate the global food system the conditions for payment and the reasons for the individual specific subsidies vary with farm product , size of the farm , nature of ownership , and country among other factors enriching peanut farmers for political purposes , keeping the price of a staple low to keep the poor from rebelling , stabilizing the production of a crop to avoid famine years , encouraging diversification and many other purposes have been suggested as the reason for specific subsidies agricultural policies may be used to support domestic producers as they gain domestic and international market share this may be a short term way of encouraging an industry until it is large enough to thrive without aid this may produce a net gain for a government despite the cost of interventions because it allows a country to build up an export industry or reduce imports it also helps to form the nation 's supply and demand market this might be relevant to a third world country with many peasant farmers , but it may also be a consideration to more developed countries such as poland price controls may also be used to assist poor citizens many countries have used this method of welfare support as it delivers cheap food to the poorest in urban areas without the need to assess people to give them financial aid the same often counts for poverty relief in the form of food aid , which ( unless while during severe drought ) drives small producers in poor countries out of production in the united states , 65 % of the approximately 16.5 billion in annual subsidies went to the top 10 % of farmers in 2002 because subsidies are linked to certain commodities some advocate fair trade rules to ensure that poor farmers in developing nations that produce crops primarily for export are not exploited or negatively impacted by trade policies , practices , tariffs , and agreements which benefit one competitor at the expense of another - which advocates consider a dangerous '' race to the bottom '' in agricultural labor and safety standards fair trade steak ? much of what developing countries export to the rich world , also comes from industrial corporations therefore , the biggest impediment to the growth of small farming and therefore of fare trade in sectors beyond coffee and bananas , is these quality demands from the rich world when rich countries subsidize domestic production , the excess output is often given to the developing world as foreign aid this process eliminates the domestic market for agricultural products in the developing world because the products can be obtained for free from western aid agencies in developing nations where these effects are most severe , small farmers could no longer afford basic inputs and were forced to sell their land several years ago , ghana was able to feed and export their surplus according to oxfam , '' if developed nations eliminated subsidy programs , the export value of agriculture in lesser developed nations would increase by 24 % , plus a further 5.5 % from tariff equilibrium exporters can offer us surpluses for sale at prices around half the cost of production ; destroying local agriculture and creating a captive market in the process canada 's department of agriculture estimates that developing nations would benefit by about 4 billion annually if subsidies in the developed world were halved many developing countries do not grow enough food to feed their own populations lower prices and free food save the lives of millions of starving people , despite the drop in food sales of the local farmers a developing nation could use new improved farming methods to grow more food , with the ultimate goal of feeding their nation without outside help market interventions may increase the cost to consumers for agricultural products , either via hidden wealth-transfers via the government , or increased prices at the consumer level , such as for sugar and peanuts in the us while this has diminished the distortions created by the common agricultural policy , many critics argue that a greater focus on the provision of public goods , such as biodiversity and clean water , is needed the wto has extracted commitments from the philippines government , making it lower import barriers to half their present levels over a span of six years , and allowing in drastically increased competition from the industrialised and heavily subsidised farming systems of north america and europe the report estimates that in the absence of trade restrictions , us subsidised maize could be marketed at less than half the price of maize grown on the philippine island of mindanao ; and that the livelihoods of up to half a million filipino maize farmers ( out of the total 1.2 million ) are under immediate threat .
