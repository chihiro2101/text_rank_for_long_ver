differential heat treatment is a method used to alter the properties of various parts of a steel object differently , producing areas that are harder or softer than others quenched-steel is usually heated again , slowly and evenly ( usually between and in a process called tempering , to soften the metal , thereby increasing the toughness however , although this softening of the metal makes the blade less prone to breaking , it makes the edge more susceptible to deformation such as dulling , peening , or curling 115 differential hardening is a method used in heat treating swords and knife to increase the hardness of the edge without making the whole blade brittle to prevent cracking and loss of surface carbon , quenching is usually performed before beveling , shaping , and sharpening the edge it can also be achieved by carefully pouring water ( perhaps already heated ) onto the edge of a blade as is the case with the manufacture of some kukri the heated portion of the metal is softened by this process , leaving the edge at the higher hardness this helps to make the blade very resistant to breaking , by making the spine very soft and bendable , but allows greater hardness at the edge than would be possible if the blade was uniformly quenched and tempered this helps to create a tough blade that will maintain a very sharp , wear-resistant edge , even during rough use such as found in combat the edge , however , will usually be too hard , so after quenching the entire blade is usually tempered to around for a short time , to bring the hardness of the edge down to around hrc60 on the rockwell hardness scale with the clay mixture , the main goal was to find a mixture that would withstand high temperatures and adhere to the blade without shrinking , cracking , or peeling as it dried by controlling the thickness of the edge-coating along with the temperature of the water , the cooling rate of each part of the blade can be controlled to produce the proper hardness upon quenching without the need for further tempering typically , the smith will also try to avoid overheating the blade to prevent the metallic crystals from growing too large this requires a temperature drop from around 750 °c ( cherry-red ) to 450 °c ( at which point the transformation is complete ) in less than a second to prevent the formation of soft pearlite care must be taken to plunge the sword quickly and vertically ( edge first ) , for if one side enters the quenching fluid before the other the cooling may be asymmetric and cause the blade to bend sideways ( warp ) an inexperienced polisher can quickly ruin a blade by applying too much pressure to the softened areas , rapidly altering the blade 's shape without much change to the hardened zone the hardened portion of the blade ( yakiba ) and the center portion ( hira ) are often given a matte finish instead , to make the differences in the hardness stand out although differential hardening produces a very hard edge , it also leaves the rest of the sword rather soft , which can make it prone to bending under heavy loads , such as parrying a hard blow however , if properly protected and maintained , these blades can usually hold an edge for long periods of time , even after slicing through bone and flesh , or heavily matted bamboo to simulate cutting through body parts , as is in iaido the gear will usually be quenched and tempered to a specific hardness first , making a majority of the gear tough , and then the teeth are quickly heated and immediately quenched , hardening only the surface 394–400 this process is often used for knife making , by heating only the edge of a previously quenched and tempered blade when combined with the stresses formed , this creates a very brittle zone between the hard and softer metal , which usually makes this method unsuitable for swords or tools that may be subjected to shear and impact stresses this makes the surface very resistant to wear , but provides tougher metal directly underneath it , leaving the majority of the object unchanged differential tempering was often used to provide a very hard cutting edge , but to soften parts of the tool that are subject to impact and shock loading this makes the tool much too hard for normal use , so the tool is tempered to reduce the hardness to a more suitable point instead , the heat is applied to only a part of the tool , allowing the heat to thermally conduct toward the cooler cutting edge as heat is applied , the colors will form near the heat source , and then slowly move across the tool , following the heat as it conducts toward the edge when the light-straw color reaches the edge , the smith will usually dip the steel in water , to stop the process the exact hardness of the soft end depends on many factors , but the main one is the speed at which the steel was heated , or how far the colors spread out , because the steel may lose too much heat before it can conduct to the edge another way is to partially embed the steel in an insulator , like sand or lime , preventing too much heat loss during tempering however , with double-edged blades , the heat source will usually need to be more precisely localized because the heat must be applied evenly along the center of the blade , allowing it to conduct to both edges the smith may need to control the temperature by using methods like pouring water along certain parts of the edge , or cooling it with ice , causing the proper temperature to reach the entire edge at the same time swords tempered in this manner , especially double-edged swords , will generally need to be rather wide , allowing room for a gradient to form when tempering high-carbon steel in the blacksmith method , the color provides a general indication of the final hardness , although some trial-and-error is usually required to match the right color to the type of steel to achieve the exact hardness , because the carbon content , the heating speed , and even the type of heat source will affect the outcome if the center of the blade is too soft , this bending may likely be permanent therefore , such an extremely hard edge is not always desirable , as greater hardness makes the edge more brittle and less resistant to impacts , such as cutting through bones , shafts of pole-arms , hitting shields or blocking and parrying
