good woofer design requires effectively converting a low frequency amplifier signal to mechanical air movement with high fidelity and acceptable efficiency , and is both assisted and complicated by the necessity of using a loudspeaker enclosure to couple the cone motion to the air if done well , many of the other problems of woofer design ( for instance , linear excursion requirements ) are reduced problems include damping the cone cleanly without audible distortion so that it does not continue to move , causing ringing , when the instantaneous input signal falls to zero each cycle , and managing high excursions ( usually required to reproduce loud sounds ) with low distortion in this case , the equalization must be individually adjusted to match the particular characteristics of the loudspeaker systems used and the room in which they are used this approach is complex and thus not likely to be used in lower cost equipment the disadvantage of this type of frame is that the basket may flex if the speaker is driven at high volumes , there being resistance to bending only in certain directions cast baskets are more expensive , but are usually more rigid in all directions , have better damping ( reducing their own resonance ) , can have more intricate shapes , and are therefore usually preferred for higher quality drivers an important woofer specification is its power rating , the amount of power the woofer can handle without damage woofer power ratings become important when the speaker is pushed to extremes : applications requiring high output , amplifier overload conditions , unusual signals ( i.e sudden impulse energy can melt a section of voice coil wire , causing an open circuit and a dead woofer ; the necessary level will vary with driver characteristics in normal listening level music applications , the electrical power rating of woofers is generally unimportant ; it remains important for higher frequency drivers thermal power handling limits may be reached when fairly high power levels are fed to a woofer for too long , even if not exceeding mechanical limits at any time typically , design variances include : cabinets built for repeated shipping and handling , larger woofer cones to allow for higher sound pressure levels , more robust voice coils to withstand higher power , and higher suspension stiffness a home stereo woofer , because it is used at relatively low volumes , may be able to handle very low frequencies the larger the room , the more air the woofer 's movement will have to displace in order to produce the required sound power at low frequencies
