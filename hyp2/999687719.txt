noah webster ( 1758–1843 ) , the author of the readers and spelling books which dominated the american market at the time , spent decades of research in compiling his dictionaries not all copies were bound at the same time ; the book also appeared in publisher 's boards ; other original bindings of a later date are not unknown again in two volumes , the title page proclaimed that the dictionary contained '' the whole vocabulary of the quarto , with corrections , improvements and several thousand additional words : to which is prefixed an introductory dissertation on the origin , history and connection of the languages of western asia and europe , with an explanation of the principles on which languages are formed when webster died , his heirs sold unbound sheets of his 1841 revision american dictionary of the english language to the firm of j this firm bound and published a small number of copies in 1844 – the same edition that emily dickinson used as a tool for her poetic composition although it was more successful financially than the original 1828 edition and was reprinted many times , noah webster was critical of it in 1850 , blackie and son in glasgow published the first general dictionary of english that made heavy use of pictorial illustrations integrated with the text , the imperial dictionary , english , technological , and scientific , adapted to the present state of literature , science , and art ; on the basis of webster 's english dictionary editor john ogilve used webster 's 1841 edition as a base , adding many new , specialized , and british words , increasing the vocabulary from websters 70,000 to more than 100,000 it was the first edition to largely overhaul noah webster 's work , and the first to be known as the unabridged porter also edited the succeeding edition , webster ’ s international dictionary of the english language ( 1890 ) , which was an expansion of the american dictionary in 1898 the collegiate dictionary also was introduced ( see below ) webster ’ s new international dictionary ( second edition , 1934 ) in 1934 , the new international dictionary was revised and expanded for a second edition , which is popularly known as webster ’ s second or w2 , although it was not published under that title some versions added a 400-page supplement called a reference history of the world , which provided chronology '' from earliest times to the present '' the editors claimed more than 600,000 entries , more than any other dictionary at that time , but that number included many proper names and newly added lists of undefined '' combination words '' because of its style and word coverage , webster 's second is still a popular dictionary court of appeals for the seventh circuit , after considering a definition from webster ’ s third new international dictionary , wrote that '' the comparable definition in the previous , and for many the classic , edition of the same dictionary is as follows : merriam issued the entirely new webster 's third new international dictionary of the english language , unabridged ( commonly known as webster 's third , or w3 ) in september 1961 since the 1961 publication of the third , merriam-webster has reprinted the main text of the dictionary with only minor corrections in 1964 , a three-volume version was issued for many years as a supplement to the encyclopedia with the ninth edition ( webster 's ninth new collegiate dictionary ( wnncd ) , published in 1983 ) , the collegiate adopted changes which distinguish it as a separate entity rather than merely an abridgment of the third new international ( the main text of which has remained virtually unrevised since 1961 ) the most notable change was the inclusion of the date of the first known citation of each word , to document its entry into the english language this dictionary is preferred as a source '' for general matters of spelling '' by the chicago manual of style , which is followed by many book publishers and magazines in the united states the first edition of the abridged primary school dictionary was prepared by noah webster in 1833 and later revised by william g since the late 19th century , dictionaries bearing the name webster 's have been published by companies other than merriam-webster throughout the 20th century , some non-merriam editions , such as webster 's new universal , were closer to webster 's work than contemporary merriam-webster editions the dictionary now called webster 's new universal no longer even uses the text of the original webster 's new universal dictionary , but rather is a newly commissioned version of the random house dictionary after worcester 's death in 1865 , revision of his dictionary of the english language was soon discontinued and it eventually went out of print the american edition of charles annandale 's four volume revision of the imperial dictionary of the english language , published in 1883 by the century company , was more comprehensive than the unabridged the century dictionary , an expansion of the imperial first published from 1889 to 1891 , covered a larger vocabulary until the publication of webster 's second in 1934 , after the century had ceased publication the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) , which published its complete first edition in 1933 , challenged merriam in scholarship , though not in the marketplace due to its much larger size the new international editions continued to offer words and features not covered by the oed , and vice versa in the 1970s , the oed began publishing supplements to its dictionary and in 1989 integrated the new words in the supplements with the older definitions and etymologies in its second edition among larger dictionaries during this period was ( non-merriam ) webster 's universal dictionary ( also published as webster 's twentieth century dictionary ) which traced its roots to noah webster and called itself '' unabridged '' , but had less than half the vocabulary and paled in scholarship against the merriam editions after the commercial success of webster 's third new international in the 1960s , random house responded by adapting its college dictionary by adding more illustrations and large numbers of proper names , increasing its print size and page thickness , and giving it a heavy cover , highly critical of webster 's third , failed in an attempt to buy out merriam-webster and determined to create its own dictionary , the american heritage dictionary of the english language other medium-sized dictionaries have since entered the market , including the new oxford american and the encarta webster 's , while merriam-webster has not attempted to compete by issuing a similar edition .
