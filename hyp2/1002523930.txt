giovanni had a paradoxical relationship with his nephew gianfrancesco pico della mirandola , who was a great admirer of his uncle , yet published examen vanitatis doctrinae gentium ( 1520 ) in opposition to the '' ancient wisdom narrative '' espoused by giovanni , described by historian charles b intended for the church by his mother , he was named a papal protonotary ( probably honorary ) at the age of ten and in 1477 he went to bologna to study canon law at the sudden death of his mother three years later , pico renounced canon law and began to study philosophy at the university of ferrara already proficient in latin and greek , he studied hebrew and arabic in padua with elia del medigo , a jewish averroist , and read aramaic manuscripts with him as well del medigo also translated judaic manuscripts from hebrew into latin for pico , as he would continue to do for a number of years pico also wrote sonnets in latin and italian which , because of the influence of savonarola , he destroyed at the end of his life it was probably in paris that giovanni began his 900 theses and conceived the idea of defending them in public debate it was an astrology auspicious day that ficino had chosen to publish his translations of the works of plato from greek into latin , under lorenzo 's enthusiastic patronage the kabbalah and hermetica were thought in pico 's time to be as ancient as the old testament as a result , he became the founder of the tradition known as christian kabbalah , which went on to be a central part of early modern western esotericism although he was a product of the studia humanitatis , pico was constitutionally an eclectic , and in some respects he represented a reaction against the exaggerations of pure humanism , defending what he believed to be the best of the medieval and islamic commentators , such as averroes and avicenna , on aristotle in a famous long letter to ermolao barbaro in 1485 it was always pico 's aim to reconcile the schools of plato and aristotle since he believed they used different words to express the same concepts similarly , pico believed that an educated person should also study hebrew and talmudic sources , and the hermetics , because he thought they represented the same concept of god that is seen in the old testament , but in different words he had them published together in december 1486 as '' conclusiones philosophicae , cabalasticae et theologicae '' , and offered to pay the expenses of any scholars who came to rome to debate them publicly through the intercession of several italian princes – all instigated by lorenzo de ' medici – king charles viii had him released , and the pope was persuaded to allow pico to move to florence and to live under lorenzo 's protection it was here that he also wrote his other most celebrated work , the disputationes adversus astrologiam divinicatrium ( treatise against predictive astrology ) , which was not published until after his death in florence , political instability gave rise to the increasing influence of savonarola , whose reactionary opposition to renaissance expansion and style had already brought about conflict with the medici family ( they eventually were expelled from florence ) and would lead to the wholesale destruction of books and paintings determined to become a monk , he dismissed his former interest in egyptian and chaldean texts , destroyed his own poetry and gave away his fortune they also included 72 theses describing what pico believed to be a complete system of physics in this book pico presents arguments against the practice of astrology that have had enormous resonance for centuries , up to our own time disputationes is influenced by the arguments against astrology espoused by one of his intellectual heroes , augustine of hippo , and also by the medieval philosophical tale ḥayy ibn yaqẓān by ibn tufail , which promoted autodidacticism as a philosophical program the manuscript was edited for publication after pico 's death by his nephew giovanni francesco pico della mirandola , an ardent follower of savonarola , and may possibly have been amended to be more forcefully critical early in his career , pico wrote a commento sopra una canzone d'amore di girolamo benivieni , in which he revealed his plan to write a book entitled poetica theologia : butorac p.357 pico 's heptaplus , a mystico-allegorical exposition of the creation according to the seven biblical senses , elaborates on his idea that different religions and traditions describe the same god he wrote in italian an imitation of plato 's symposium christiane joost-gaugier described pico della mirandola as '' a major philosophical inspiration of the fresco 's program , especially insofar as he was the most outspoken proponent of the harmony of plato and aristotle '' in james joyce 's ulysses , the precocious stephen dedalus recalls with disdain his boyhood ambitions , and apparently associates them with the career of mirandola : '' remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves , deeply deep.copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world.pico della mirandola like however , this '' spell '' was first depicted ( as the key to a rather simple form of divination , not a great and terrible summoning ) by , and in all likelihood created by , heinrich cornelius agrippa von nettesheim in his three books of occult philosophy this was written several decades after mirandola 's death and was the first written example of that '' spell '' , so it is almost impossible for mirandola to have been the source of those '' magic words '' psychoanalyst otto rank , a rebellious disciple of sigmund freud , chose a substantial excerpt from mirandola 's oration on the dignity of man as the motto for his book art and artist : creative urge and personality development , including : '' '' in irving stone 's novel about michelangelo , the agony and the ecstasy , book 3 , part 3 contains a paragraph 's description of mirandola as part of the scholarly circle that surrounded lorenzo di medici in florence mirandola was described as a man who spoke 22 languages , was deeply read in philosophy , and someone who made no enemies philosopher of social science rené girard mentions mirandola passingly in his book des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde ( things hidden since the foundation of the world ) , girard writes in a disparaging tone , '' people will accuse us of playing at being pico della mirandola—the renaissance man—certainly a temptation to be resisted today , if we wish to be seen in a favourable light in frédéric lenoir 's novel l'oracle della luna ( 2006 ) , the philosophy of pico della mirandola forms one of the major teachings acquired by the protagonist , giovanni , from his main spiritual master the major mentions are : at the end of chapter 21 the sage – a fictitious character – says he has personally met pico della mirandola and discusses mirandola 's disagreement with the pope about the 900 theses ( with lenoir stating that only 7 of them had not been accepted ) and the philosopher 's later fate in the words of the sage , the main goal of ficino and pico della mirandola was to acquire universal knowledge , free from prejudice and from linguistic and religious barriers ; at the end of chapter 24 , having discussed luther 's concept of free will , the sage wants the acquaint giovanni with mirandola 's ideas on this issue and lets him read '' de hominis dignitate '' ; giovanni peruses the book with great interest in chapter 25 ; at the beginning of chapter 26 , with giovanni having now read the oration on the dignity of man , the sage discusses two issues from the book with him one is pico della mirandola 's attempt to form one unified and universal philosophy and the difficulties thereof the other one is mirandola 's concept of free will also , he is one of the main characters in her novel lent in the book dying for ideas ; the dangerous lives of the philosophers ( 2015 ) by romanian philosopher costica bradatan , mirandola 's life and work is taken as an early or even first example of taking human life as a project of 'self-fashioning ' , relating this to mirandola 's heretic idea of man being part of creation with 'an indefinite nature ' the renaissance philosophy of man the pico project at the university of bologna and brown university is a project to make accessible a complete resource for the reading and interpretation of the dignity of man
