alternative names include haversack from the german hafersack meaning '' oat sack '' ( which more properly describes a small cloth bag on a strap worn over one shoulder and originally referred to the bag of oats carried as horse fodder ) , kraxe ( a german rucksack with a rigid framework ) , and bergen ( a large load-carrying rucksack , from a design issued by the british army during the second world war ) a pack frame , when present , serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately , by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs external frame packs were designed to carry heavy loads ( > 20 & nbsp ; kg or 40 & nbsp ; lb ) , giving the wearer more support and protection and better weight distribution than a simple , frameless strapped bag for this reason , external frame packs are generally considered to be a '' cooler load '' than internal frame designs military packs are often external frame designs due to their ability to carry loads of different shapes , sizes and weights the other type of external frame which recently was proposed , is made from composite plastic which is not flexible like current backpack straps and also it is a kind of material that can be shaped like human spine curvature the straps of this backpack are wide enough to distribute the pressure on shoulders and also a white glass wool layer is added to the internal part of them to absorb dynamic forces , which could be produced through walking the internal frame backpack is a recent innovation , invented in 1967 by greg lowe , who went on to found lowe alpine and lowepro , companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment a complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place the internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment ; a few lash points ( including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items ) may be present , but as the frame is completely integrated , it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack internal frame packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking , but newer models have improved greatly in these respects in addition , because of their snug fit , the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities typical school backpacks generally lack the rigid frame of an outdoor-style backpack and include only a few pockets in the front in addition to the main storage compartment while traditionally very simple in design , school backpacks are often made with padded shoulder straps and backs as well as additional reinforcement to hold large numbers of heavy textbooks , as well as safety features such as reflective panels to make the wearer of the pack more visible at night because of their design , rolling backpacks reduce the strain on the user , though the shoulder straps may be used to carry the pack for short distances when the terrain is not suitable for wheels there is also a small but thriving industry devoted to creating historical reproductions of military gear ; such companies generally produce period-appropriate uniforms and other gear in addition to backpacks some more recent military/tactical designs , especially the molle and ilbe packs used by the united states armed forces , are covered with webbing loop attachment points for increased carrying capacity they may include features such as sections for water bladders and specially designed pouches , such as those used to carry personal fire shelters hydration packs , sometimes used by athletes and military personnel , carry water ( in either a bladder or a rigid bottle ) and have a tube connected to them from which the wearer can drink without removing the pack ; this feature is also included in some more general-purpose hiking backpacks
