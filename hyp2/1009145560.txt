ehrlich and holdren argued that all three factors were important but emphasized the role of human population growth , focusing on a broader scale , being less specific in space and time the environment may be viewed as a self-regenerating system that can endure a certain level of impact although the un projects that human population may stabilize at around 11.2 billion in 2100 , the i pat equation will continue to be relevant for the increasing human impact on the environment in the short to mid-term future increased population increases humans ' environmental impact in many ways , which include but are not limited to : increased land use - results in habitat loss for other species increased resource use - results in changes in land cover increased pollution - can cause sickness and damages ecosystems increased climate change increased biodiversity loss as the consumption of each person increases , the total environmental impact increases as well ecological impacts of each product are far-reaching ; increases in consumption quickly result in large impacts on the environment through direct and indirect sources since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways , the unit for t is often tailored for the situation to which i pat is being applied for example , for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured , an appropriate unit for t might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gdp increases in efficiency from technologies can reduce specific environmental impacts , but due to increasing prosperity these technologies yield for the people and businesses that adopt them , technologies actually end up generating greater overall growth into the resources that sustain us criticisms of the i pat formula : too simplistic for complex problem interdependencies between variables general sweeping assumptions of variables â€™ effect toward environmental impact cultural differences cause wide variation in impact technology can not properly be expressed in a unit , the efficiency in carbon use ) since 1980 , world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth similarly , an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of energy and material use were almost always outpaced by economic growth , resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution this means the equation does not account for varying degrees of power , influence , and responsibility of individuals over environmental impact also , the p factor does not account for the complexity of social structures or behaviors , resulting in blame being placed on the global poor it is assumed that small-scale societies have low environmental impacts due to their practices and orientations alone but there is little evidence to support this in fact , the generally low impact of small-scale societies compared to state societies is due to a combination of their small numbers and low-level technology
