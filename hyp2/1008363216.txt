many small early hillforts were abandoned , with the larger ones being redeveloped at a later date 600 bc – 50 ad ) late iron age prehistoric europe saw a growing population outside greece and italy , which were more densely populated , the vast majority of settlements in the iron age were small , with perhaps no more than 50 & nbsp ; inhabitants with the emergence of oppida in the late iron age , settlements could reach as large as 10,000 & nbsp ; inhabitants by this time the larger ones had become more like cities than fortresses and many were assimilated as roman towns excavations at hillforts in the first half of the 20th & nbsp ; century focussed on the defenses , based on the assumption that hillforts were primarily developed for military purposes lowland : an inland location without special defensive advantages ( except perhaps marshes ) , but surrounded by artificial ramparts ; typical of later settled oppida hillforts in britain are known from the bronze age , but the great period of hillfort construction was during the iron age , between 700 bc and the roman conquest of britain in 43 ad where roman influence was less strong , such as uninvaded ireland and unsubdued northern scotland , hillforts were still built and used for several more centuries some iron age hillforts were also incorporated into medieval frontier earthworks king alfred established a network of coastal hillforts and lookout posts in wessex , linked by a herepath , or military road , which enabled his armies to cover viking movements at sea even those that were defensive settlements in the iron age were sometimes used for corralling animals in later periods however , hillforts were built also in poland and further east , until the middle ages during the period of late antiquity or migration period a large number of hilltop settlements were established both on the roman imperial territory and on germanic soil unlike the romans , however , the germanii did not use mortar at that time for their construction among the best known hill settlements in germany are the runder berg near bad urach and the gelbe bürg near dittenheim even in areas that were remote from the roman empire , such as southern sweden , numerous hillfort sites of this period have been found the larger hillforts are also called , or ( english : cities ) the finnish word for hillfort is linnavuori ( plural linnavuoret ) , meaning fort hill or castle hill , or alternatively muinaislinna meaning ancient fort , as opposed to bare linna which refers to medieval or later fortifications one special feature about the finnish hillforts that while most of them are located these days within some distance from the sea , but earlier many of the forts were located by the sea , due to post-glacial rebound there are around 40 known hillforts in ireland one must be careful to not confuse a hill-fort with a 'ringfort ' - a medieval settlement - a common archaeological feature across the whole island of ireland , of which over 40,000 examples are known ; one source claims there may be 10,000 undiscovered ringforts some hillforts have cairns inside their boundaries and there are many speculations about this phenomenon , the theories range from being a strange cult religion to just coincidence the same kind of area as they both like ( hill tops with commanding views of the local vicinity ) , the excavation at freestone hill in county kilkenny has shown that there was indeed a ditch cut out around the cairn , evidence that they had respect for the feature no matter what they decided to believe about it latvian hillforts generally were a part of a complex consisting of the main fortress , the settlement around it , one or more burial fields and nearby ritual sites some were continuously inhabited until the late iron age during the roman iron age , some of the latvian hillforts ( like ķivutkalns ) were abandoned or became sparsely populated a new period in hillfort development started during the 5th-8th centuries ad , when many new hillforts appeared , in most cases , along the main trades routes - rivers the earliest examples in present-day lithuania are found in the east of the country two main defence lines developed : one along the neman river ( against the teutonic order ) and another along the border with livonia in scandinavia and northern russia , hillforts are fortifications from the iron age which may have had several functions hillforts with strong walls are often located beside old trade routes and have an offensive character , whereas others are reclusive and were weakly fortified , probably only for hiding during raids
