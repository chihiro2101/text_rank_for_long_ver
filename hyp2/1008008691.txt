when sybaris was still populated the coscile pursued a direct course into the gulf of taranto , probably at a short distance to the north aristotle writes the achaeans were accompanied by a number of troezenian citizens , but they were eventually expelled by the more numerous achaeans diodorus siculus describes how sybaris had amassed great wealth and a huge population as a result of its fertile farming land and its policy of admitting aliens to its citizenry furthermore , he explains that sybaris was a dominant power in the region which ruled over four tribes and twenty-five subject cities the oenotrian city pandosia was one of the settlements which seems to have been controlled by sybaris poseidonia was founded in approximately 600 bc , but it is unknown when the latter two colonies were founded the army sizes given by diodorus ( shared with strabo ) must have been even more exaggerated than the population size an analysis of core samples taken from the site did not find such river deposits directly above the former city after its destruction the surviving inhabitants took refuge at their colonies laüs and scidrus it is assumed some also fled to poseidonia , because in the early fifth century poseidonia 's coins adopted the achaean weight standard and the bull seen on sybarite coins graham thinks it was plausible that the number of refugees was large enough for some kind of synoecism to have occurred between the poseidonians and the sybarites , possibly in the form of a sympolity regardless of the results of the siege of 476 & nbsp ; bc , it seems the sybarites had to leave their city at some point between that year and 452/1 & nbsp ; bc it is thought that poseidonia had a major share in this because the coins of the new city have a great resemblance to those of poseidonia possibly a treaty of friendship between sybaris , its allies and the serdaioi ( an unknown people ) dates to this new foundation , because poseidonia was the guarantor of this treaty ultimately the sybarites were again driven off by the krotoniates from their new city in 446/5 & nbsp ; bc the request for help from the sybarites must have been made after the conclusion of the thirty years ' peace in the early spring of 445 & nbsp ; bc , for it would not have made sense to ask for help while sparta and athens were still at war with each other in 444/3 & nbsp ; bc the athenians and other new colonists then turned the city into a new foundation called thurii unlike herodotus , diodorus and earlier ancient greek writers , later authors from the roman period denounced the sybarites a fragment of the comedian metagenes he quotes has a sybarite boasting about literal rivers of food flowing through the city metagenes , testimonia and fragments not only does athenaeus provide a great deal of examples to show the decadence of sybarites , he also argues that their excessive luxury and sins led to their doom according to athenaeus ambassadors of the sybarites ( one of whom was named amyris ) consulted the pythia , who prophesied that war and internal conflict awaited them if they would honor man more than the gods he altered details of the original accounts , disguised his own contributions as those of past historians and invented new information to fit his argument that luxury leads to catastrophe this concept was called tryphé and was a popular belief in his time , at the turn of the 2nd century ad he points out the vast natural wealth of the city was the more likely reason it was attacked by kroton the earliest archaeological exploration in the last quarter of the 19th century failed to find the location of sybaris list of ancient greek cities
