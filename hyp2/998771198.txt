having native habitats that vary from being epiphytic and saxicolous , species have certain adaptations , such as root systems designed to anchor to other plants or substrates , and modified trichomes for water and nutrient intake some of the species , like the majority of bromeliaceae , grow as funnel bromeliads , with a compressed stem axis these leaf rosettes , a common physical characteristic in tillandsia species , collect nutrients and water an air plant 's foliage may also change color when it blooms , also attracting pollinators the green species with their claim to a cool-humid climate live mostly more in the shade terrestrial or in the lower levels of the forests ( ) in contrast , almost all gray species live in precipitation-poor areas with high humidity some species are more or less xeromorphic since tillandsia are not self-fertile , the pollen must come from another plant of the same species tillandsia , depending on the species , may take months or years to flower after flowering , the plant forms offsets and dies publisher naturbuch verlag Â© 1992 weltbildverlag gmbh augsburg the amount of light required depends on the species ; overall , air plants with silver dusting and stiff foliage will require more sunlight than air plants with softer foliage for so-called '' aerial '' species ( the majority of the common species in culture except tillandsia cyanea ) , that is to say those whose roots are transformed into crampons without any power of absorption , watering is done by the leaves in the form of frequent sprays , or brief soaking of the plant in a container full of water species of tillandsia photosynthesis through a process called cam cycle , where they close their stomata during the day to prevent water loss and open them at night to fix carbon dioxide and release oxygen they do not have a functional root system and instead absorb water in small amounts through their leaves via small structures called trichomes species of tillandsia also absorb their nutrients from debris and dust in the air any root system found on tillandsia has grown to act as a fragile stabilizing scaffold to grip the surface they grow on some common types of tillandsia include ball moss ( t the genus contains around 650 species , where 635 are considered epiphytic mendoza , c
