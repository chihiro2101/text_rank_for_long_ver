intestacy has a limited application in those jurisdictions that follow civil law or roman law because the concept of a will is itself less important ; the doctrine of forced heirship automatically gives a deceased person 's next-of-kin title to a large part ( forced estate ) of the estate 's property by operation of law , beyond the power of the deceased person to defeat or exceed by testamentary gift these are known as forced heirship rights and are not typically found in common law jurisdictions , where the rules of succession without a will ( intestate succession ) play a back-up role where an individual has not ( or has not fully ) exercised his or her right to dispose of property in a will these rules have been supplemented by the discretionary provisions of the inheritance ( provision for family and dependants ) act 1975 so that fair provision can be made for a dependent spouse or other relative where the strict divisions set down in the intestacy rules would produce an unfair result , for example by providing additional support for a dependent minor or disabled child vis-a-vis an adult child who has a career and no longer depends on their parent for persons with surviving children and a wealth below a certain threshold ( Â£270,000 as from february 2020 the whole of the estate will pass to the deceased 's spouse or also , from december 2005 , their registered civil partner is legally assigned ) to the crown ( via the bona vacantia division of the treasury solicitor ) or to the duchy of cornwall or duchy of lancaster when the deceased was a resident of either ; in limited cases a discretionary distribution might be made by one of these bodies to persons who would otherwise be without entitlement under strict application of the rules of inheritance they will receive the following : all property passing to them by survivorship ( such as the deceased 's share in the jointly owned family home ) ; all property passing to them under the terms of a trust ( such as a life insurance policy ) ; a statutory legacy of a fixed sum ( being a larger sum where the deceased left no children ) ; and a life interest in half of the remaining estate as in england , most jurisdictions apply rules of intestate succession to determine next of kin who become legal heirs to the estate each of the separate states uses its own intestacy laws to determine the ownership of residents ' intestate property attempts in the united states to make probate and intestate succession uniform from state to state , through efforts such as the uniform probate code , have been met with limited success maryland 's intestacy laws specify not only the distribution , but also the order of the distribution among family members
