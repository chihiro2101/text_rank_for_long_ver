'' behr said that the earliest mention of the dominion was purposely planted in the comic season two ferengi episode , '' rules of acquisition '' , to leave the audience with an impression of '' how important could it be ? '' it was decided that the gamma quadrant would need an ambience that would distinguish it from the alpha quadrant these three were intended to represent the front of an ancient civilization coupled together by fear , to contrast with the unity of the federation enabled by bonds of friendship the dominion incorporated a vast number of planets , and their resident species , into its military and civilian ranks , including : changelings/founders ( the rulers of the dominion ) vorta ( administrative/diplomatic/scientist class of clones ; genetic engineering by the founders ) jem'hadar ( shock troops under the direct command of the vorta ; genetically engineered by the founders ) son ' a hunters skreea karemma dosi breen cardassians t-rogorans little is revealed regarding the dominion 's inner workings , other than the fact that the jem'hadar and vorta fulfill the main military and administrative roles respectively he vows to search the alpha quadrant in order to find the other missing hundred changelings like himself in order to create a new great link in a battle with a changeling spy , odo ended up killing him , thus breaking the most important rule of the changelings , that no changeling may ever hurt another ( '' the adversary '' ) although his deepest desire is to rejoin the great link , he is reluctant to do so due to the female changeling/founder 's mad crusade of total war against every solid in the alpha quadrant ; ironically , in the last episode odo does rejoin the great link , saving them from being totally destroyed a federation starship , the uss odyssey , was destroyed by a kamikaze attack after the federation rescued sisko , as the dominion demonstrated not only an ability to penetrate shielding , but a fanatical devotion to their cause as the suicide attack was made on a retreating ship , solely to drive the point home to the federation as a result of this incident , the federation pulled the uss defiant out of storage ( which was originally designed to combat the borg ) , complete with a romulan cloaking device , and began preparations for a drastic increase in deep space nine 's defensive capabilities a federation mission the next year to find and make peace with the founders ended disastrously , when the peace expedition was captured and subjected to hallucinogenic manipulation to test the willingness of the federation to appease the dominion as a result of the continued dominion threat , numerous alpha quadrant powers acted with increased preparations and paranoia , one expression of which was the romulan attempt to forcibly collapse the wormhole the alliance suffered brutal losses for over three months , until captain sisko organized a task force to retake deep space nine forced to move early because of intelligence that the dominion was on the verge of taking down the minefield , the federation departed before a full force could be assembled and found themselves blocked and outnumbered by a dominion-cardassian fleet after hours of fighting , dominion ships were outflanked by the arrival of a large klingon fleet , which won the running battle and allowed the defiant to break through to deep space nine the federation retained control of deep space nine for the remainder of the war threatened with dominion penetration into the inner sphere of their territories , federation and klingon forces needed a new strategy through successful subterfuge , the romulan star empire was tricked into allying with the other two alpha quadrant powers , as a response to rumors that the dominion had plans to attack their empire later in the war , the mysterious race known as the breen joined forces with the dominion , and launched a devastating attack against starfleet headquarters on earth ( ds9 , '' the changing face of evil '' ) ( ds9 , '' what you leave behind '' ) the founders themselves were nearly wiped out by a plague , which was revealed to be a biological weapon engineered by agents of the secret clandestine federation agency section 31 , who deliberately infected odo with it , in the expectation that he would pass it through the great link while the dominion was pushed back to cardassia prime , odo linked with the female founder , curing her and simultaneously convincing her to surrender to the allied forces of the federation the state of the dominion as a political entity at the conclusion of the war has never been discussed in star trek canon at the conclusion of the war , it is assumed that the dominion still held vast territories in the gamma quadrant odo 's return to the great link is partially intended to share with the other changelings the information he has about how the war concluded and what he knows from living with solids ; presumably , this is to change the goals and tactics of the founders to a system that coexists with the solids as opposed to a strategy of domination the lost fleet was flung into the future and immediately began assaulting the alpha quadrant , unaware the war already concluded years prior
