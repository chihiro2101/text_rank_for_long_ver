a player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a team-mate must then become involved in active play , in the opinion of the referee , in order for an offence to occur when the offside offence occurs , the referee stops play , and awards an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play the only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player 's offside position , or if a forward , having left the field , returns and gains an advantage one of the main duties of the assistant referees is to assist the referee in adjudicating offside — their position on the sidelines giving a more useful view sideways across the pitch '' the 2005 edition of the laws of the game included a new ifab decision that stated , '' in the definition of offside position , 'nearer to his opponents ' goal line ' means that any part of their head , body or feet is nearer to their opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent by 2017 , the wording had changed to say that , in judging offside position , '' the hands and arms of all players , including the goalkeepers , are not considered '' in other words , a player is in an offside position if two conditions are met : any part of the player 's head , body or feet is in the opponents ' half of the field ( excluding the half-way line ) in this context , according to the ifab , '' a ‘ save ’ is when a player stops , or attempts to stop , a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms ( unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area ) since offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a team-mate , not when the player receives the ball , it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent , or even the last opponent , without committing an offence the new wording sought to define the three cases more precisely , but a number of football associations and confederations continued to request more information about what movements a player in an offside position could make without interfering with an opponent in enforcing this rule , the referee depends greatly on an assistant referee , who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last opponent , the ball , or the halfway line , whichever is closer to the goal line of their relevant end the assistant referees ' task with regard to offside can be difficult , as they need to keep up with attacks and counter-attacks , consider which players are in an offside position when the ball is played , and then determine whether and when the offside-positioned players become involved in active play the risk of false judgement is further increased by the foreshortening effect , which occurs when the distance between the attacking player and the assistant referee is significantly different from the distance to the defending player , and the assistant referee is not directly in line with the defender in general , offside rules intend to prevent players from “ goal-hanging ” – staying near the opponent 's goal and waiting for the ball to be passed to then directly score a goal ( this is similar to the current offside law in rugby , under which any player between the ball and the opponent 's goal who takes part in play , is liable to be penalised ) in the 1847 laws of the eton field game , as player could not be considered '' sneaking '' if there were four or more opponents between him and the opponents ' goal line he criticized most existing offside laws for being too lax : the rugby laws , for example , were at fault because they permitted an offside player to rejoin play immediately after an opponent touched the ball , while eton 's rule of four allowed '' an immense amount of sneaking '' when the number of players was unlimited thring expressed his views through correspondence in the sporting newspapers such as the field , and through the publication in 1862 of a proposed set of laws known as the simplest game , including a strict offside law which required a player in an offside position ( '' out of play '' , in thring 's terminology ) to '' return behind the ball as soon as possible '' that meeting was , however , disrupted by a dispute over the subject of '' hacking '' ( allowing players to carry the ball , provided they could be kicked in the shins by opponents when doing so , in the manner of rugby school ) this exception was necessary because every player on the attacking side would have otherwise been '' out of play '' from such a kick over the next seven years , there were several attempts to change the three-player rule , but none were successful : in 1867 , barnes fc proposed that the offside rule should be removed altogether , arguing that '' a player did not stop to count whether there were three of his opponents between him and their own goal '' however , the two codes were eventually unified without any change in this area ; the sheffield clubs accepted the fa 's three-player offside rule in 1877 , after the fa compromised by allowing the throw-in to be taken in any direction the original laws allowed players to be in an offside position even when in their own half this change , proposed by the scottish fa , was made in order to '' encourage the attacking team '' by '' giving the attacking player an advantage over the defender in 2005 , ifab clarified that , when evaluating an attacking player 's position for the purposes of the offside law , the part of the player 's head , body or feet closest to the defending team 's goal-line should be considered , with the hands and arms being excluded because '' there is no advantage to be gained if only the arms are in advance of the opponent '' in 2009 , it was stated that a defender who leaves the field of play without the referee 's permission must be considered to be on the nearest boundary line for the purposes of deciding whether an attacker is in an offside position in 2016 , it was clarified that a player on the halfway line itself can not be in an offside position : part of the player 's head , body or feet must be within the opponent 's half of the field of play the concept was that offside should only apply in the last of play ( inside or beside the penalty area ) the manager of one of the teams involved , celtic manager jock stein , complained that it was unfair to expect teams to play under one set of rules in one game and then a different set a few days before or later ( according to the '' strict '' offside law used in 1863 , every player on the attacking side would automatically have been in an offside position from such a goalkick , since it had to be taken from the goal line ) under the original laws of 1863 , it was not possible to be offside from a throw-in ; however , since the ball was required to be thrown in at right-angles to the touch-line , it would have been unusual for a player to gain significant advantage from being ahead of the ball the next year ( 1878 ) a new law was introduced to allow a player to be offside from a throw-in when first introduced in 1872 , the corner kick was required to be taken from the corner-flag itself , which made it impossible for an attacking player to be in an offside position relative to the ball in 1874 , the corner-kick was allowed to be taken up to one yard from the corner-flag , thus opening up the possibility of a player being in an offside position at the international football conference of december 1882 , it was agreed that a player should not be offside from a corner-kick ; this change was incorporated into the laws of the game in 1883
