typically this step is repeated until the system reaches a state that is good enough for the application , or until a given computation budget has been exhausted to investigate the behavior of simulated annealing on a particular problem , it can be useful to consider the transition probabilities that result from the various design choices made in the implementation of the algorithm for each edge ( s , s ' ) of the search graph , the transition probability is defined as the probability that the simulated annealing algorithm will move to state s ' when its current state is s in practice , it 's common to use the same acceptance function for many problems , and adjust the other two functions according to the specific problem however , this acceptance probability is often used for simulated annealing even when the function , which is analogous to the proposal distribution in metropolisâ€“hastings , is not symmetric , or not probabilistic at all one that is not based on the probabilistic acceptance rule ) could speed-up the optimization process without impacting on the final quality instead , they proposed that '' the smoothening of the cost function landscape at high temperature and the gradual definition of the minima during the cooling process are the fundamental ingredients for the success of simulated annealing when choosing the candidate generator , one must consider that after a few iterations of the simulated annealing algorithm , the current state is expected to have much lower energy than a random state thus , in the traveling salesman example above , one could use a function that swaps two random cities , where the probability of choosing a city-pair vanishes as their distance increases beyond t on the other hand , one can often vastly improve the efficiency of simulated annealing by relatively simple changes to the generator the physical analogy that is used to justify simulated annealing assumes that the cooling rate is low enough for the probability distribution of the current state to be near thermodynamic equilibrium at all times in the simulated annealing algorithm , the relaxation time also depends on the candidate generator , in a very complicated way other adaptive approach as thermodynamic simulated annealing , automatically adjusts the temperature at each step based on the energy difference between the two states , according to the laws of thermodynamics lionsolver focuses on combining machine learning with optimization , by adding an internal feedback loop to self-tune the free parameters of an algorithm to the characteristics of the problem , of the instance , and of the local situation around the current solution genetic algorithms maintain a pool of solutions rather than just one annealing has also been suggested as a mechanism for increasing the diversity of the search intelligent water drops algorithm ( iwd ) which mimics the behavior of natural water drops to solve optimization problems parallel tempering is a simulation of model copies at different temperatures ( or hamiltonians ) to overcome the potential barriers
