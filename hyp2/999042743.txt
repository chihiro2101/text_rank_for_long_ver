from 1952 to 1968 , all german fords were called the taunus , using the model names 12m , 15m , 17m , 20m , and 26m ( on some scandinavian markets , for a short while the branding 10m was used on a slightly better-equipped export version of the early taunus , which is said to be the precursor of later uses ) the 12m , 15m , and 17m models had a stone engine , which in the first 12m was a carryover of the sidevalve ( flathead ) engine from the first taunus series , and beginning with the 15m , it was replaced by an overhead-valve design similar to the british ford consul engine with the introduction of the new 12m line ( internal code p4 ) for 1962 came the v4 engine , which starting in late 1964 with the larger 17m/20m became the base engine for the taunus m-series the 20m and 26m models had the ford cologne v6 engine , which is basically the same engine design with two extra cylinders added however , a few exceptions from that rule were made , such as 17m 1800 , which was powered by the v6 in its smallest displacement of 90.777 l and the 20m 2300s ( in the later p7 series ) , which used a 2.3-l version of the same engine something else the new ford taunus 12m had in common with british fords was the retention of an old side-valve engine at a time when competitors were increasingly moving over to overhead-valve units the second generation 12m was not a new car , but a reworking of the 1952 model all cars were called 12m , though both engines were continued the new ford taunus p4 was similar in size , but a completely new car based on the ford cardinal project : new body , new v4 engine , front-wheel drive the ford taunus p6 came with new bodies , whilst engines and platform were continued the ford taunus p2 was as long as ( though significantly narrower than ) the british consul mk2 , but a different car the ford taunus p3 had a completely new body in a very modern style at a time when competitors boasted that all four corners of the vehicles were visible from the driver 's seat , the new taunus instead offered a streamlined form although the 1.7-litre version was launched with the same 60 ps power output as the outgoing model , the new model was a full 10 & nbsp ; km/h ( 6 & nbsp ; mph ) faster , which was attributed to improved aerodynamics and a lighter body shell the ford taunus p5 came with a new body and new engines for the new ford p7 , there was a new body ; engines and platform were carried over from the p5 the engines of the 17m/20m p5 were continued , with only one addition on the top end shrinking sales of the p7 forced ford to offer a restyled car only one year later , and the new car was again called p7 ford offered a two- or four-door sedan or a five-door station wagon/estate ( identified like previous taunus estates as the turnier ) the taunus tc along with the cortina mk iii and their successors have been produced in slightly updated forms in europe , argentina and widely across asia by ford or their local co-operators cortinas were also built in small numbers starting with the predecessor cortina mk ii throughout the model series ' european/east asian lifespan under license by korean automaker hyundai
