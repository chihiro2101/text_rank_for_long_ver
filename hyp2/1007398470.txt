though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless , the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic grapheme ( 22 letters , the period , the comma , and space ) though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish , the library also must contain , somewhere , every coherent book ever written , or that might ever be written , and every possible permutation or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books the narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information , including predictions of the future , biographies of any person , and translations of every book in all languages others believe that since all books exist in the library , somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library 's contents ; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the '' man of the book '' has read it , and they travel through the library seeking him '' borges would examine a similar idea in his 1975 story , '' the book of sand '' in which there is an infinite book ( or book with an indefinite number of pages ) rather than an infinite library moreover , the story 's book of sand is said to be written in an unknown alphabet and its content is not obviously random in any case , a library containing all possible books , arranged at random , might as well be a library containing zero books , as any true information would be buried in , and rendered indistinguishable from , all possible forms of false information ; the experience of opening to any page of any of the library 's books has been simulated by websites which create screenfuls of random letters every book in the library is '' intelligible '' if one decodes it correctly , simply because it can be decoded from any other book in the library using a third book as a one-time pad one can see any text as being pulled from the library by the act of the author defining the search letter by letter until they reach a text close enough to the one they intended to write the text already existed theoretically , but had to be found by the act of the author 's imagination another implication is an argument against certain proofs of the existence of god , as it is carried out by david hume using the thought experiment of a similar library of books generated not by human mind , but by nature borges ' narrator notes this fact , but believes that the library is nevertheless infinite ; he speculates that it repeats itself periodically , giving an eventual '' order '' to the '' disorder '' of the seemingly random arrangement of books quine noted the interesting fact that the library of babel is finite ( that is , we will theoretically come to a point in history where everything has been written ) , and that any text that does n't fit in a single book can be reconstructed by finding a second book ( which is guaranteed to exist ) with the continuation the miracle of the finite but universal library is a mere inflation of the miracle of binary notation : everything worth saying , and everything else as well , can be said with two characters in the library of babel , finding any book that made sense was impossible due to the sheer number and lack of order daniel dennett 's 1995 book darwin 's dangerous idea includes an elaboration of the library of babel concept to imagine the set of all possible genetic sequences , which he calls the library of mendel , in order to illustrate the mathematics of genetic variation russell standish 's theory of nothing uses the concept of the library of babel to illustrate how an ultimate ensemble containing all possible descriptions would in sum contain zero information and would thus be the simplest possible explanation for the existence of the universe in greg bear 's novel city at the end of time ( 2008 ) , the sum-runners carried by the protagonists are intended by their creator to be combined to form a 'babel ' , an infinite library containing every possible permutation of every possible character in every possible language each book is marked by a coordinate , corresponding to its place on the hexagonal library ( hexagon name , wall number , shelf number , and book name ) so that every book can be found at the same place every time
