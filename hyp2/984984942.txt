depending on the detail of the images to be printed , the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower line screen '' line screen '' is the term used for the number of cells engraved on the anilox low line screen rolls ( 100-300 lpi ) are used where a heavy layer of ink is desired , such as in heavy block lettering the roll then rotates to make contact with the flexographic printing plate which receives the ink from the cells for transfer to the printed material anilox roll selection should be based on cell volume or capacity of the engraved cells the other reverse angle blade works as previously described , removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll the characteristics of an anilox roll determine the amount of ink that will be transferred to the plate : angle of the cells , cell volume , and line screen low line numbers will allow for a heavy layer of ink to be printed , whereas high line numbers will permit finer detail in printing the rolls are often specified by their line screen , which is the number of cells per linear inch higher volumes address combination , screens , line work , solid coverage and coating applications there are many variables to consider when specifying an anilox roll beyond the print requirements , such as substrate , ink system , plate material , plate mounting tape , press speed , and drying capacity there are two ways to specify anilox roll settings : on transfer volume or on line count this is because depending on the pattern used for the cell and depth of gravure of the anilox roll , the cell might contain higher or lower volumes of ink
