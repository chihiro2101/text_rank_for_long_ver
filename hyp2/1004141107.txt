this is because processual archaeologists adhere to leslie white 's theory that culture can be defined as the exosomatic ( outside the body ) means of environmental adaptation for humans trigger , 1989:295 methodologically , the advocates of the new archaeology had to come up with ways of analyzing the archaeological remains in a more scientific fashion there was such a dearth of work in this area that it led willey and phillips to state in 1958 , '' so little work has been done in american archaeology on the explanatory level that it is difficult to find a name for it '' binford 1962:21 ethno-historical ( history of peoples ) research involves living and studying the life of those who would have used the artifacts - or at least a similar culture during the late 1960s and into the 1970s , archaeologist kent flannery began championing the idea that systems theory could be used in archaeology to attack questions of culture from an unbiased perspective nevertheless , systems theory has become a very important part of processualism , and is perhaps the only way archaeologists can examine other cultures without interference from their own cultural biases in 1973 , the processualist david clarke of cambridge university would publish an academic paper in antiquity claiming that as a discipline , archaeology had moved from its original '' noble innocence '' through to '' self-consciousness '' and then onto '' critical self-consciousness '' , a symptom of which was the development of the new archaeology processualism 's development transformed archaeology , and is sometimes called the '' new archaeology '' with few notable exceptions such as boston university , universities in america classify archaeology as a sub-discipline of anthropology , while in europe it is thought to be a subject more like historical studies like the other social scientists , the new archaeologists or processualists wanted to utilize scientific methodology in their work the question of where to put archaeology as a discipline , and its concomitant issues of what archaeology ought to study and which methods it ought to use , likely played no small part in the emergence of post-processualism in europe in his 2010 book on archaeological theory , matthew johnson- then of the university of southampton , now at northwestern university- argued that despite the intervening 40 years since its development , the '' intellectual questions '' first posed by processualism remained '' absolutely central '' to archaeology clarke suggested that the new archaeology would face particular opposition from amateurs , historical archaeologists and practical excavators but argued that such individuals would still benefit from the theory 's adoption supposed objectivity of interpretation writing in 1987 , the archaeologist christopher chippindale of cambridge university spoke on the view of processualism at that time , putting it in the context of the 1960s , when he stated that : : the sharper students of the current generation reasonably regard the '' new archaeology '' in its pristine form as a period piece , as strange an artefact of that remote era as the paris évènements or woodstock
