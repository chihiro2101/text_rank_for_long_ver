boundaries between micro grains , if the oxide layer is crystalline , form an important pathway for oxygen to reach the unoxidized metal below some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the metals to which they are applied they showed that oxide layer prevented certain dopants into the silicon wafer , while allowing for others , thus discovering the passivating effect of oxidation on the semiconductor surface in the late 1950s , atalla further discovered that the formation of a thermally grown sio 2 layer greatly reduced the concentration of surface states , and discovered the important quality of sio 2 films to preserve the electrical characteristics of pâ€“n junctions and prevent these electrical characteristics from deteriorating by the gaseous ambient environment he found that silicon oxide layers could be used to electrically stabilize silicon surfaces atalla developed the surface passivation process , a new method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below in carbon quantum dot ( cqd ) technology , cqds are small carbon nanoparticles ( less than 10 & nbsp ; nm in size ) with some form of surface passivation aluminium naturally forms a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide on contact with oxygen in the atmosphere through a process called oxidation , which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in many environments some aluminium alloys , however , do not form the oxide layer well , and thus are not protected against corrosion there are methods to enhance the formation of the oxide layer for certain alloys however , the aluminium layer clad on is designed to spontaneously develop the oxide layer and thus protect the base alloy ferrous materials , including steel , may be somewhat protected by promoting oxidation ( '' rust '' ) and then converting the oxidation to a metalophosphate by using phosphoric acid and further protected by surface coating as the uncoated surface is water-soluble , a preferred method is to form manganese or zinc compounds by a process commonly known as parkerizing or phosphate conversion one common mode of corrosion in corrosion-resistant steels is when small spots on the surface begin to rust because grain boundaries or embedded bits of foreign matter ( such as grinding swarf ) allow water molecules to oxidize some of the iron in those spots despite the alloying chromium however , proprietary passivation processes exist for martensitic stainless steel , which is difficult to passivate , as microscopic discontinuities can form in the surface of a machined part during passivation in a typical nitric acid bath with citric acid , simply rinsing and drying the part and allowing the air to oxidise it , or in some cases the application of other chemicals , is used to perform the passivation of the surface various testing methods are available to determine the passivation ( or passive state ) of stainless steel
