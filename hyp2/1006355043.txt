coke was taught at norwich to value the '' forcefulness of freedom of speech '' , something he later applied as a judge after six years at the inner temple he was called to the bar on 20 april 1578 , a remarkably fast rate of progress given the process of legal education at the time , which normally required eight years of study the case was actually two actions , with the first judgement being given in denny 's favour after coke 's research found a flaw in the pleadings that invalidated cromwell 's case after the case was restarted , coke argued that denny had commented on cromwell 's support of people attacking the book of common prayer , and was not implying any deeper disloyalty coke was very proud of his actions in this case and later described it in his reports as '' an excellent point of learning in actions of slander '' the next year he was elected reader of lyon 's inn for three years , something surprising considering his young age and likely related to his conduct in lord cromwell 's case his lectures were on the statute of uses , and his reputation was such that when he retired to his house after an outbreak of the plague , '' nine benchers , forty barristers , and others of the inn accompanied him a considerable distance on his journey '' in order to talk to him coke became involved in the now classic shelley 's case in 1581 , which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today ; the case also established coke 's reputation as an attorney and case reporter his next famous case was chudleigh 's case , a dispute over the interpretation of the statute of uses , followed by slade 's case , a dispute between the common pleas and king 's bench over assumpsit now regarded as a classic example of the friction between the two courts and the forward movement of contract law ; coke 's argument in slade 's case formed the first definition of consideration the political '' old guard '' began to change around the time coke became a member of parliament this created a vacancy among the law officers of the crown , and thanks to the influence of the cecil family , coke became solicitor general on 16 june 1592 the parliament was intended to be a brief and simple one ; with the black death resurgent throughout england and the threat of spain on the horizon , the only matter was to impose certain taxes to fund the queen 's campaign against the spanish , with no bills to be introduced on 27 february james morice , a puritan member of parliament , proposed two new bills : one against the bishops of the church of england , and the other against the court of high commission cecil first pointed out that the queen had forbidden bills on religion ; parliament ignored him , and the bill went ahead immediately afterwards , coke was summoned by the queen , who made it clear that any action on the bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty the position of master of the rolls had become vacant in april 1593 , and coke was expected to be appointed according to convention ; bacon , therefore , would become attorney general coke was reconfirmed as attorney general under james , and immediately found himself dealing with '' a series of treasons , whether real or imaginary '' the first of these was the trial of sir walter raleigh ; according to cuthbert william johnson , one of coke 's biographers , '' there is , perhaps , no reported case in which the proofs against the prisoner were weaker than in this trial & nbsp ; coke conducted the prosecution for the government – an easy one , since the conspirators had no legal representation – and through his speeches , '' blackened them in the eyes of the world '' in 1606 coke reported the star chamber case de libellis famosis , which ruled that truth was not a defence against an accusation of seditious libel , and also held that ordinary common law courts could enforce this , a doctrine which thus outlived the star chamber after its abolition in 1642 his conduct was noted by johnson as '' from the first , excellent ; ever perfectly upright and fearlessly independent '' , although the convention of the day was that the judges held their positions only at the pleasure of the monarch some assert that coke became chief justice due to his prosecutions of raleigh and the gunpowder plot conspirators , but there is no evidence to support this ; instead , it was traditional at the time that a retiring chief justice would be replaced with the attorney general in 1607 parliament openly asked for coke 's opinion on the high commission 's practices ; he replied that '' no man ecclesiastical or temporal shall be examined upon secret thoughts of his heart or of his secret opinion '' the court of king 's bench argued that this was a lay matter , while the high commission claimed it fell under their jurisdiction this was a defeat for the common law , and in response coke spent the summer issuing writ of prohibition to again challenge bancroft and the high commission on 6 november 1608 , the common law judges and members of the high commission were summoned before the king and told that they would argue and allow him to decide at this point the king 's own position in relation to the law , and his authority to decide this matter , was brought up , in what became known as the case of prohibitions james stated that '' in cases where there is not express authority in law , the king may himself decide in his royal person ; the judges are but delegates of the king '' coke challenged this , saying '' the king in his own person can not adjudge any case , either criminal – as treason , felony etc , or betwixt party and party ; but this ought to be determined and adjudged in some court of justice , according to the law and custom of england '' they started with notes he made as a law student in the winter of 1572 , with full reporting of cases from october 1579 after being called to the bar in 1578 he began attending court cases at westminster hall , and soon drew the attention of court officials – many early reports have notes that he was told '' by old plowden '' or '' by wray cj '' john baker has described them as '' perhaps the single most influential series of named reports '' , and even francis bacon , coke 's rival , wrote in praise of them , saying '' had it not been for sir edward coke 's reports ( which though they may have errors , and some peremptory and extrajudicial resolutions more than are warranted , yet they contain infinite good decisions and rulings over of cases ) , for the law by this time had been almost like a ship without ballast ; for that the cases of modern experience are fled from those that are adjudged and ruled in former time '' although loaned to friends and family , and therefore in slight public circulation , coke 's reports were never formally used during his lifetime coke 's famous case of proclamations , and his speech there , was first brought into the public consciousness through its inclusion in volume & nbsp ; 12 of his reports , and roland g in july 1634 , officials acting on order of the king had seized coke 's papers , but a 1641 motion in the house of commons restored the extant papers to coke 's eldest son it is ostensibly a commentary on sir thomas littleton 's treatise on tenures , but actually covered many areas of the law of his time the third institutes has been described as '' the first really adequate discussion of treason , a work which went far towards offering the remedy of a humanized common law to the injustices of trial procedures '' there are also factual inaccuracies ; kenyon homfray in the ecclesiastical law journal notes that , despite being considered the supreme legal authority on the subject of consecration , which coke covered in the third volume of the institutes , he offered no legal support for his opinion and ignored those pieces of case law which rejected his interpretation coke argued that the judges of the common law were those most suited to making law , followed by parliament , and that the monarch was bound to follow any legal rules coke 's commentary on littleton has been interpreted as deliberately obtuse , with his aim being to write what cromartie called '' a sort of anti-textbook , a work whose very form denied that legal knowledge could be organised john selden similarly thought that the common law was the proper law of england the law was nothing more than a contract made by the english people ; this is known as the '' appeal to contract '' the case of john lilburne later confirmed that not only was such an oath invalid , but that there was a right to silence , drawing from coke 's decisions in reaching that conclusion his work in slade 's case led to the rise of modern contract law , and his actions in the case of proclamations and the other pleadings which led to his eventual dismissal went some way towards securing judicial independence the statute of monopolies , the foundation for which was laid by coke and which was drafted by him , is considered one of the first steps towards the eventual english civil war , and also '' one of the landmarks in the transition of england 's economy from the feudal to the capitalist '' the legal precept that no one may enter a home unless by invitation , was established as common law in coke ’ s institutes the castle doctrine originates from coke 's statement in the third institutes that '' a man 's home is his castle – for where shall he be safe if it not be in his house ? '' , which also profoundly influenced the fourth amendment to the united states constitution ; the third amendment , on the other hand , was influenced by the petition of right his most famous arguments can be read in complete state trials volume i and ii coke was pedantic and technical , something which saw him win many cases as a barrister , but when he became attorney general '' he showed the same qualities in a less pleasing form & nbsp ; francis watt , writing in the juridical review , portrays this as coke 's strongest characteristic as a lawyer : that he was a man who '' having once taken up a point or become engaged in a case , believes in it with all his heart and soul , whilst all the time conscious of its weakness , as well as ready to resort to every device to bolster it up '' james i claimed that coke '' had already as much land as it was proper a subject should possess
