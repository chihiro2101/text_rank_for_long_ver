the main difference between the effects of single and multiple scattering is that single scattering can usually be treated as a random phenomenon , whereas multiple scattering , somewhat counterintuitively , can be modeled as a more deterministic process because the combined results of a large number of scattering events tend to average out multiple scattering can thus often be modeled well with diffusion theory with multiple scattering , the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by a large number of scattering events , so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity optical elements designed to produce multiple scattering are thus known as diffusers speckle also occurs if multiple parts of a coherent wave scatter from different centers electromagnetic waves are one of the best known and most commonly encountered forms of radiation that undergo scattering several different aspects of electromagnetic scattering are distinct enough to have conventional names major forms of elastic light scattering ( involving negligible energy transfer ) are rayleigh scattering and mie theory light scattering is one of the two major physical processes that contribute to the visible appearance of most objects , the other being absorption in order for rayleigh 's model to apply , the sphere must be much smaller in diameter than the wavelength ( Î» ) of the scattered wave ; typically the upper limit is taken to be about 1/10 the wavelength in this size regime , the exact shape of the scattering center is usually not very significant and can often be treated as a sphere of equivalent volume the inherent scattering that radiation undergoes passing through a pure gas is due to microscopic density fluctuations as the gas molecules move around , which are normally small enough in scale for rayleigh 's model to apply for larger diameters , the problem of electromagnetic scattering by spheres was first solved by gustav mie , and scattering by spheres larger than the rayleigh range is therefore usually known as mie theory electrophoretic light scattering involves passing an electric field through a liquid which makes particles move
