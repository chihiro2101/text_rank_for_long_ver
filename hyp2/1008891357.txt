however , outside of the us and canada , sprinklers are rarely mandated by building codes for normal hazard occupancies which do not have large numbers of occupants ( e.g building regulations in scotland and england require fire sprinkler systems to be installed in certain types of properties to ensure safety of occupants sprinklers have been in use in the united states since 1874 , and were used in factory applications where fires at the turn of the century were often catastrophic in terms of both human and property losses in the us , sprinklers are today required in all new high rise and underground buildings generally above or below fire department access , where the ability of firefighters to provide adequate hose streams to fires is limited most us building codes allow for less expensive construction materials , larger floor area limitations , longer egress paths , and fewer requirements for fire rated construction in structures protected by fire sprinklers consequently , the total building cost is often decreased by installing a sprinkler system and saving money in the other aspects of the project , as compared to building a non-sprinklered structure for example , the presence of a sprinkler system will usually permit doubling of compartment sizes and increases in travel distances ( to fire exits ) as well as allowing a reduction in the fire rating of internal compartment walls a sprinkler activation will do less water damage than a fire department hose stream , which provide approximately 900 litres/min ( 250 us gallons/min ) in addition , a sprinkler will usually activate within one to four minutes of the fire 's start , whereas it typically takes at least five minutes for a fire department to register an alarm and drive to the fire site , and an additional ten minutes to set up equipment and apply hose streams to the fire this additional time can result in a much larger fire , requiring much more water to extinguish while such systems were once common in cold areas , after several fires caused by systems running too high a percentage of antifreeze , the regulatory authority in the united states effectively banned new antifreeze installations sections 7-2 and a7-2 water is not present in the piping until the system operates ; instead , the piping is filled with air at a pressure below the water supply pressure to prevent the larger water supply pressure from prematurely forcing water into the piping , the design of the dry pipe valve ( a specialized type of check valve ) results in a greater force on top of the check valve clapper by the use of a larger valve clapper area exposed to the piping air pressure , as compared to the higher water pressure but smaller clapper surface area in regions using nfpa 13 regulations , the time it takes water to reach the hydraulically remote sprinkler from the time that sprinkler is activated is limited to a maximum of 60 seconds the maximum time of water delivery may be required to be reduced , depending on the hazard classification of the area protected by the sprinkler system this perceived benefit is due to a fear that wet system piping may slowly leak water without attracting notice , while dry pipe systems may not fail in this manner disadvantages of using dry pipe fire sprinkler systems include : if the sprinklers share the same standpipe system as the standpipe system which supplies fire hoses , then the water supply to the fire hoses would be severely reduced or even curtailed altogether increased complexity : dry pipe systems require additional control equipment and air pressure supply components which increases system complexity 750 gallons ) of individual dry-pipe systems , unless additional components and design efforts are provided to limit the time from sprinkler activation to water discharge to under one minute increased fire response time : because the piping is empty at the time the sprinkler operates , there is an inherent time delay in delivering water to the sprinklers which have operated while the water travels from the riser to the sprinkler , partially filling the piping in the process '' deluge '' systems are systems in which all sprinklers connected to the water piping system are open , in that the heat sensing operating element is removed , or specifically designed as such these systems are used for special hazards where rapid fire spread is a concern , as they provide a simultaneous application of water over the entire hazard because the heat sensing elements present in the automatic sprinklers have been removed ( resulting in open sprinklers ) , the deluge valve must be opened as signaled by a fire alarm system the operation of single interlock systems are similar to dry systems except that these systems require that a '' preceding '' fire detection event , typically the activation of a heat or smoke detector , takes place prior to the '' action '' of water introduction into the system 's piping by opening the pre-action valve , which is a mechanically latched valve ( i.e in this way , the system is essentially converted from a dry system into a wet system these systems require that both a '' preceding '' fire detection event , typically the activation of a heat or smoke detector , and an automatic sprinkler operation take place prior to the '' action '' of water introduction into the system 's piping activation of either the fire detectors alone , or sprinklers alone , without the concurrent operation of the other , will not allow water to enter the piping because water does not enter the piping until a sprinkler operates , double interlock systems are considered as dry systems in terms of water delivery times , and similarly require a larger design area this type of system is typically used where water damage may be a concern , or where water supplies are limited systems can be applied using local application method or total flooding method , similar to clean agent fire protection systems control mode sprinklers are intended to control the heat release rate of the fire to prevent building structure collapse , and pre-wet the surrounding combustibles to prevent fire spread most sprinkler systems installed today are designed using an area and density approach first the building use and building contents are analyzed to determine the level of fire hazard for example , in an office building classified as light hazard , a typical design area would be and the design density would be per or a minimum of applied over the design area another example would be a manufacturing facility classified as ordinary hazard group 2 where a typical design area would be and the design density would be per or a minimum of applied over the design area after the design area and density have been determined , calculations are performed to prove that the system can deliver the required amount of water over the required design area these calculations account for all of the pressure that is lost or gained between the water supply source and the sprinklers that would operate in the design area most residential sprinkler systems are primarily designed to suppress a fire in such a way to allow for the safe escape of the building occupants while these systems will often also protect the structure from major fire damage , this is a secondary consideration some tests have shown that the volume of water needed to extinguish a fire with such a system installed can be dramatically less than with a conventional sprinkler system some communities have laws requiring residential sprinkler systems , especially where large municipal hydrant water supplies ( '' fire flows '' ) are not available nationwide in the united states , one and two-family homes generally do not require fire sprinkler systems , although the overwhelming loss of life due to fires occurs in these spaces
