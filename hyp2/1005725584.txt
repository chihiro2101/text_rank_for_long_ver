the orange river then runs westward through south africa , forming the south-western boundary of the free state province at the western point of the free state , southwest of kimberley , the orange meets with its main tributary , the vaal river , which itself forms much of the northern border of the province in this section , the namib desert terminates on the north bank of the river , so under normal circumstances , the volume of water added by these tributaries is negligible as the collection point for the majority of south africa 's water , the orange river plays a major role in supporting agriculture , industry , and mining to assist in this , two large water schemes have been created , the orange river project and the lesotho highlands water project historically , the river played an important role in the south african diamond rush , with the first diamonds in the country being discovered in alluvium deposits on the orange today , several commercial diamond mines operate along the final stretch of the orange river and around its mouth the orp was built to use the unused water of the orange river – which , without the vaal river , represents some 14.1 % of the total runoff in south africa – and in the process , to satisfy an increasing demand for water the main objectives of the project were : to stabilise river flow , the generation and transmission of hydroelectric power , to provide a reliable water supply for users in the orange river basin , and to give a new lease on life to water-deficient areas in the eastern cape , such as the great fish and sundays river valleys from here , the water is supplied in two directions , westward along the orange river ( via hydroelectric power generators ) to the vanderkloof dam which was previously named the pk le roux dam , and southward through the orange-fish tunnel to the eastern cape image : gariepdam.jpg left thumb the gariep dam on the orange river is the largest dam in south africa , and was a key part of the orange river project image : orange river wine farm.jpg thumb a vineyard on the orange river left irrigation in the vast area downstream of the vanderkloof dam , which has turned thousands of hectares of arid veld into highly productive agricultural land , was made possible by the construction of the gariepand vanderkloof dams in recent years , the northern cape wine along the orange river have grown in importance water is delivered to south africa by means of the delivery tunnel which passes under the lesotho south africa border at the caledon river , and then under the little caledon river south of clarens in the free state , and discharges into the ash river about 30 & nbsp ; km further to the north today , several commercial diamond mines operate on the last stretch of the river , as well as the beaches around its mouth diamond mines also operate on the middle stretch of the river
