broadly speaking , there are two possible approaches to linguistic transcription systems for phonetic transcription thus furnish rules for mapping individual sounds or phones to written symbols systems for orthographic transcription , by contrast , consist of rules for mapping spoken words onto written forms as prescribed by the orthography of a given language which type of transcription is chosen depends mostly on the research interests pursued phonetic transcription is doubtlessly more systematic in a scientific sense , but it is also harder to learn , more time-consuming to carry out and less widely applicable than orthographic transcription mapping spoken language onto written symbols is not as straightforward a process as may seem at first glance written language is an idealization , made up of a limited set of clearly distinct and discrete symbols spoken language , on the other hand , is a continuous ( as opposed to discrete ) phenomenon , made up of a potentially unlimited number of components literature is relatively consistent in pointing out the nonneutrality of transcription practices knowledge of social culture enters directly into the making of a transcript transcription systems are sets of rules which define how spoken language is to be represented in written symbols examples for orthographic transcription systems ( all from the field of conversation analysis or related fields ) are : the field of conversation analysis itself includes a number of distinct approaches to transcription and sets of transcription conventions the first , called narrow transcription , captures the details of conversational interaction such as which particular words are stressed , which words are spoken with increased loudness , points at which the turns-at-talk overlap , how particular words are articulated , and so on if such detail is less important , perhaps because the analyst is more concerned with the overall gross structure of the conversation or the relative distribution of turns-at-talk amongst the participants , then a second type of transcription known as broad transcription may be sufficient ( williamson , 2009 ) this system is employed universally by those working from the ca perspective and is regarded as having become a near-globalized set of instructions for transcription ) : talking data â€“ transcription and coding in discourse research for the former , the work is still very much done by a human transcriber who listens to a recording and types up what is heard in a computer , and this type of software is often a multimedia player with functionality such as playback or changing speed some of the software would also include the function of annotation
