the process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells this gives them the ability to create patient specific pluripotent cells , which could then be used in therapies or disease research these cells are deemed to have a pluripotent potential because they have the ability to give rise to all of the tissues found in an adult organism leading scientists to seek an alternative method of obtaining stem cells , scnt is one such method a potential use of stem cells genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient 's particular disease the disease specific stem cell lines could then be studied in order to better understand the condition another application of scnt stem cell research is using the patient specific stem cell lines to generate tissues or even organs for transplant into the specific patient the resulting cells would be genetically identical to the somatic cell donor , thus avoiding any complications from transplant rejection despite many attempts , success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited there lies a problem in the human cell 's ability to form a blastocyst ; the cells fail to progress past the eight cell stage of development this is thought to be a result from the somatic cell nucleus being unable to turn on embryonic genes crucial for proper development taking this into account the research group applied their new technique in an attempt to produce human scnt stem cells in may 2013 , the oregon group reported the successful derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines derived through scnt , using fetal and infant donor cells there remained the question of whether the same success could be accomplished using adult somatic cells implementing the procedure pioneered by the oregon research group they indeed were able to grow stem cells generated by scnt using adult cells from two donors aged 35 and 75 , indicating that age does not impede a cell 's ability to be reprogrammed retrieved 18 april 2014 late april 2014 , the new york stem cell foundation was successful in creating scnt stem cells derived from adult somatic cells the group was then able to successfully culture these stem cells and induce differentiation the following year , this method achieved a key goal of scnt-based stem cell research : the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines that have all genes linked to various diseases some scientists working on scnt-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced pluripotent stem cells though recent studies have put in question how similar ips cells are to embryonic stem cells this raises the question of how well ips cells can mimic the gold standard esc in experiments , as stem cells are defined as having the ability to differentiate into any cell type scnt stem cells do not pose such a problem and continue to remain relevant in stem cell studies most researchers believe that in the foreseeable future it will not be possible to use the current cloning technique to produce a human clone that will develop to term somatic cell nuclear transfer ( scnt ) can be inefficient due to stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus in early research were enormous proposals to use nucleus transfer techniques in human stem cell research raise a set of concerns beyond the moral status of any created embryo , open letter to us senate on human cloning , ( march 19 , 2002 ) one concern is that blastula creation in scnt-based human stem cell research will lead to the reproductive cloning of humans one vision for successful stem cell therapies is to create custom stem cell lines for patients each custom stem cell line would consist of a collection of identical stem cells each carrying the patient 's own dna , thus reducing or eliminating any problems with rejection when the stem cells were transplanted for treatment for example , to treat a man with parkinson 's disease , a cell nucleus from one of his cells would be transplanted by scnt into an egg cell from an egg donor , creating a unique lineage of stem cells almost identical to the patient 's own cells ) potentially millions of patients could benefit from stem cell therapy , and each patient would require a large number of donated eggs in order to successfully create a single custom therapeutic stem cell line stem cell experts consider it unlikely that such large numbers of human egg donations would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long-term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyper-ovulation ( ovulating several eggs at once ) to address the problem of creating a human egg market , some stem cell researchers are investigating the possibility of creating artificial eggs if successful , human egg donations would not be needed to create custom stem cell lines
