calmodulin ’ s ability to recognize a tremendous range of target proteins is due in large part to its structural flexibility the flexible central domain of calmodulin allows the protein to wrap around its target , although alternate modes of binding are known binding of calmodulin induces conformational rearrangements in the target protein via “ mutually induced fit ” , leading to changes in the target protein ’ s function calcium participates in an cell signaling system by acting as a diffusible second messenger to the initial stimuli this is a very important function of calmodulin because it indirectly plays a role in every physiological process that is affected by smooth muscle contraction such as digestion and contraction of arteries ( which helps distribute blood and regulate blood pressure ) however , high calcium levels can be toxic to a plant 's cellular energy metabolism and , hence , the ca 2+ concentration in the cytosol is maintained at a submicromolar level by removing the cytosolic ca 2+ to either the apoplast or the lumen of the intracellular organelles ca 2+ pulses created due to increased influx and efflux act as cellular signals in response to external stimuli such as hormones , light , gravity , abiotic stress factors and also interactions with pathogens plants contain cam-related proteins ( cmls ) apart from the typical cam proteins arabidopsis thaliana contains about 50 different cml genes which leads to the question of what purpose these diverse ranges of proteins serve in the cellular function hence , cam is essential for the dwf1 function in plant growth cam binding proteins are also known to regulate reproductive development in plants however , these cam-binding protein kinase are also present in the shoot apical meristem of tobacco and a high concentration of these kinases in the meristem causes a delayed transition to flowering in the plant similarly , cam is also essential at the pollen tube apex , where its primarily role involves the guidance of the pollen tube growth the cml43 from the apr134 also binds to ca 2+ ions in vitro which shows that cml43 and apr134 are , hence , involved in the ca 2+ -dependent signaling during the plant immune response to bacterial pathogens the atbag6 protein is a cam-binding protein that binds to cam only in the absence of ca 2+ and not in the presence of it mutations in the cam binding proteins can lead to severe effects on the defense response of the plants towards pathogen infections different root cell types show a different ca 2+ response to osmotic and salt stresses and this implies the cellular specificities of ca 2+ patterns a tight control on the gaba synthesis is important for plant development and , hence , increased gaba levels can essentially affect plant development therefore , external stress can affect plant growth and development and cam are involved in that pathway controlling this effect its unique location in the cell nucleus and cytosol demonstrates interaction with calmodulin that requires the use of ca 2+ by exposing the plant to versatile stress conditions , it can cause different proteins that enable the plant cells to tolerate environmental changes to become repressed many other proteins bind calcium , although binding calcium may not be considered their principal function in the cell .
