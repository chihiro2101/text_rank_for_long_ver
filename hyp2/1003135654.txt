in most kelp , the thallus ( or body ) consists of flat or leaf-like structures known as blades the holdfast , a root-like structure , anchors the kelp to the substrate of the ocean gas-filled bladders ( pneumatocysts ) form at the base of blades of american species , such as nereocystis lueteana , ( mert sea urchins , for example , can reduce entire areas to urchin barrens kelp may develop dense forests with high production , abdullah , m.i production , respiration and exudation of dissolved organic matter by the kelp laminaria hyperborea along the west coast of norway species distribution and habitat exploitation of fauna associated with kelp ( laminaria hyperborea ) along the norwegian coast follow me radd.michyy and lowk3y.nadine l diurnal , horizontal and vertical dispersal of kelp associated fauna numerous sessile animals ( sponges , bryozoans and ascidians ) are found on kelp stipes and mobile invertebrate fauna are found in high densities on epiphytic algae on the kelp stipes and on kelp holdfasts while larger invertebrates and in particular sea urchins strongylocentrotus droebachiensis ( o.f m√ºller ) are important secondary consumers controlling large barren ground areas on the norwegian coast , they are scarce inside dense kelp forests giant kelp can be harvested fairly easily because of its surface canopy and growth habit of staying in deeper water 270 kelp polysaccharides are used in skin care as gelling ingredients and because of the benefits provided by fucoidan kelp in its natural form has not yet been demonstrated to have such effects commercial production of kelp harvested from its natural habitat has taken place in japan for over a century some of the earliest evidence for human use of marine resources , coming from middle stone age sites in south africa , includes the harvesting of foods such as abalone , limpets , and mussels associated with kelp forest habitats suggested that kelp forests around the pacific rim may have facilitated the dispersal of anatomically modern humans following a coastal route from northeast asia to the americas this '' kelp highway hypothesis '' suggested that highly productive kelp forests supported rich and diverse marine food webs in nearshore waters , including many types of fish , shellfish , birds , marine mammals , and seaweeds that were similar from japan to california , erlandson and his colleagues also argued that coastal kelp forests reduced wave energy and provided a linear dispersal corridor entirely at sea level , with few obstacles to maritime peoples archaeological evidence from california 's channel islands confirms that islanders were harvesting kelp forest shellfish and fish , beginning as much as 12,000 years ago this expression is contrasted with the employed returnee , having a dynamic ability to travel across the ocean : the '' sea turtle '' and is also homophonic with another word , literally '' sea return '' ) herbivores are released from their usual population regulation , leading to over-grazing of kelp and other algae this can quickly result in barren landscapes where only a small number of species can thrive fishing , trophic cascades , and the structure of algal assemblages : evaluation of an old but untested paradigm other major factors which threaten kelp include marine pollution and the quality of water , climate changes and certain invasive species bull kelp , nereocystis luetkeana , a northwestern american species kombu , saccharina japonica ( formerly laminaria japonica ) and others , several edible species of kelp found in japan america ) other species in the laminariales that may be considered as kelp : alaria esculenta ( north atlantic ) alaria marginata post some animals are named after the kelp , either because they inhabit the same habitat as kelp or because they feed on kelp these include : northern kelp crab ( pugettia producta ) and graceful kelp crab ( pugettia gracilis ) , pacific coast of north america
