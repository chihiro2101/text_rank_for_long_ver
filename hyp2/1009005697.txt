chameleons have very good eyesight for reptiles , letting them see small insects from a 5–10 meter distance chameleons exposed to ultraviolet light show increased social behavior and activity levels , are more inclined to bask and feed , and are also more likely to reproduce , as it has a positive effect on the pineal gland while the chameleons ' tongues are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies ( their length excluding the tail ) , smaller chameleons ( both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species ) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts thus , smaller chameleons are able to project their tongues greater distances than the larger chameleons that are the subject of most studies and tongue length estimates , and can project their tongues more than twice their body length the thermal sensitivity of tongue retraction in chameleons , however , is not a problem , as chameleons have a very effective mechanism of holding onto their prey once the tongue has come into contact with it , including surface phenomena , such as wet adhesion and interlocking , and suction the thermal insensitivity of tongue projection thus enables chameleons to feed effectively on cold mornings prior to being able to behaviorally elevate their body temperatures through thermoregulation , when other sympatric lizards species are still inactive , likely temporarily expanding their thermal niche as a result the face was found to have a different glow , appearing as dots otherwise known as tubercles on facial bones the glow results from proteins , pigments , chitin , and other materials that make up a chameleon 's skeleton , possibly giving chameleons a secondary signaling system that does not interfere with their color-changing ability , and may have evolved from sexual selection the female will dig a hole — from , deep depending on the species — and deposit her eggs small brookesia species may only lay two to four eggs , while large veiled chameleons ( chamaeleo calyptratus ) have been known to lay clutches of 20–200 ( veiled chameleons ) and 10–40 ( panther chameleons ) eggs clutch sizes can also vary greatly among the same species eggs generally hatch after four to 12 months , again depending on species to understand the dynamics of water potential in chameleon eggs , the consideration of exerted pressure on eggshells will be essential because the pressure of eggshells play an important role in the water relation of eggs during entire incubation period the ovoviviparous species , such as the jackson 's chameleon ( trioceros jacksonii ) have a five- to seven-month gestation period chameleons generally eat insects , but larger species , such as the common chameleon , may also take other lizards and young birds the range of diets can be seen from the following examples : the veiled chameleon , chamaeleo calyptratus from arabia , is insectivorous , but eats leaves when other sources of water are not available the common chameleon of europe , north africa , and the near east , chamaeleo chamaeleon , mainly eats wasps and mantises ; such arthropods form over three quarters of its diet some experts advise that the common chameleon should not be fed exclusively on crickets ; these should make up no more than half the diet , with the rest a mixture of waxworms , earthworms , grasshoppers , fly , and plant materials such as green leaves , oats , and fruit some chameleons like the panther chameleon of madagascar regulate their vitamin d3 levels , of which their insect diet is a poor source , by exposing themselves to sunlight since its uv component increases internal production birds and snakes represent the most important predation of adult chameleons and invertebrates , especially ants , put a high predatory pressure on chameleon eggs and juveniles
