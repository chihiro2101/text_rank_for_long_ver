dispersal is the separation of pieces of an organism caused by natural events ( i.e for example , chemical changes occur at every stage of the process , because of bacteria covered within this field is the dominance of biological versus physical agents in the destruction of remains from all major taxonomic groups ( plants , invertebrates , vertebrates ) processes that concentrate biological remains ; especially the degree to which different types of assemblages reflect the species composition and abundance of source faunas and floras fossils are ubiquitous in sedimentary rocks , yet paleontologys can not draw the most accurate conclusions about the lives and ecology of the fossilized organisms without knowing about the processes involved in their fossilization for example , if a fossil assemblage contains more of one type of fossil than another , one can infer either that the organism was present in greater numbers , or that its remains were more resistant to decomposition by coming to understand the oceanographic and ethology implications of observed taphonomic patterns , paleontologists have been able to provide new and meaningful interpretations and correlations that would have otherwise remained obscure in the fossil record archaeologists study taphonomic processes in order to determine how plant and animal ( including human ) remains accumulate and differentially preserve within archaeological sites the processes most commonly identified within zooarchaeology include thermal alteration ( burns ) , cut marks , worked bone , and gnaw marks when there is little to no written record , taphonomy allows environmental archaeologists to better comprehend the ways in which a group interacted with their surrounding environments and inhabitants because of the very select processes that cause preservation , not all organisms have the same chance of being preserved first and foremost , organisms that biomineralization have a far greater chance of being represented in the fossil record than organisms consisting of soft tissue only especially shallow sea coasts produce large amounts of fossils , so organisms living in such conditions have a much higher chance of being preserved as fossils than organisms living in non-depositing conditions a sedimentary deposit may have experienced a mixing of noncontemporaneous remains within single sedimentary units via physical or biological processes ; i.e because population turnover rates of individual taxa are much less than net rates of sediment accumulation , the biological remains of successive , noncontemporaneous populations of organisms may be admixed within a single bed , known as time-averaging the degree varies on many factors , such as tissue type , the habitat , the frequency of burial events and exhumation events , and the depth of bioturbation within the sedimentary column relative to net sediment accumulation rates a related problem is the slow changes that occur in the depositional environment of an area ; a deposit may experience periods of poor preservation due to , for example , a lack of biomineralizing elements much of the incompleteness of the fossil record is due to the fact that only a small amount of rock is ever exposed at the surface of the earth , and not even most of that has been explored the taphonomic pathways involved in relatively inert substances such as calcite ( and to a lesser extent bone ) are relatively obvious , as such body parts are stable and change little through time however , the preservation of '' soft tissue '' is more interesting , as it requires more peculiar conditions it was thought that only tough , cuticle type soft tissue could be preserved by burgess shale type preservation , but an increasing number of organisms are being discovered that lack such cuticle , such as the probable chordate pikaia and the shellless odontogriphus plants and algae produce the most preservable compounds , which are listed according to their preservation potential by tegellaar ( see reference ) however , erosion also tends to destroy smaller fossils more easily taphonomic processes allow researchers of multiple fields to identify the past of natural and cultural objects often these findings can be used to better understand cultural or environmental shifts within the present day
