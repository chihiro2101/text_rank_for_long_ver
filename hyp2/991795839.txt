in the study of economics and market competition , collusion takes place within an industry when rival companies cooperate for their mutual benefit collusion often takes place within an oligopoly market structure , where there are few firms and agreements have significant impacts on the entire market or industry firms face a kinked demand curve if , when one firm decreases its price , other firms are expected to follow suit in order to maintain sales kinked demand potentially fosters supra-competitive prices because any one firm would receive a reduced benefit from cutting price , as opposed to the benefits accruing under neoclassical theory and certain game-theoretic models such as bertrand competition practices that suggest possible collusion may include one or more actions such as : price fixing and setting of an unjustified high or an unjustified low price kickbacks and blanket referral agreements between competing businesses dividing territories and market allocation tying ( commerce ) and anticompetitive product bundling ( although , not all product bundling is anticompetitive ) refusal to deal and exclusive dealing dumping ( pricing policy ) vertical restraints horizontal territorial allocation bid rigging there are many ways that implicit collusion tends to develop : the practice of stock analyst conference calls and meetings of industry participants almost necessarily results in tremendous amounts of strategic and price transparency if the practice of the industry causes more complicated pricing , which is hard for the consumer to understand ( such as risk-based pricing , hidden taxes and fees in the wireless industry , negotiable pricing ) , this can cause competition based on price to be meaningless ( because it would be too complicated to explain to the customer in a short advertisement ) cheating : there is considerable incentive to cheat on collusion agreements ; although lowering prices might trigger price wars , in the short term the defecting firm may gain considerably potential entry : new firms may enter the industry , establishing a new baseline price and eliminating collusion ( though anti-dumping laws and tariffs can prevent foreign companies entering the market )
