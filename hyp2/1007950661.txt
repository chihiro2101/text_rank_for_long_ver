one modern author suggests that richard amerike was born in 1445 at meryk court , weston under penyard , near ross-on-wye , herefordshire he may have been born earlier than this , since one of amerike 's daughters , joan , was married to a future lawyer , john broke , by april 1479 75 little is known of the first thirty years of ap meryk 's life 165–67 the greater part of amerike 's adult life was spent in , or near , bristol carus-wilson , the overseas trade of bristol in the later middle ages ( bristol record society 1937 ) , pp carus-wilson , the overseas trade of bristol in the later middle ages ( bristol record society 1937 ) , pp unfortunately when amerike shipped on the trinity of bristol for a voyage to andalucia in 1480 the purser , whose private accounts survive , failed to record the mark of amerike , or indeed of any other merchant shipping 1–28 the mark associated with amerike in modern times belongs to a different man , living a century later in september 1486 amerike became one of the customs officials in bristol , holding the post of king 's customs officer , known as a 'customer ' , from 1486 until december 1502 under the authority of king henry vii of england john cabot led three voyages of discovery from bristol in search of new lands and a route to the supposed riches of the east the second , in 1497 , was the famous expedition in the matthew of bristol , which found 'new land ' that cabot thought was part of asia but was probably the modern newfoundland this made sense , since under the terms of cabot 's letters patent from henry vii , which gave him his authority , all trade from any new lands discovered was to pass through bristol however , no list of sponsors has ever been found , and the only proven funding , in amounts insufficient for a voyage , came from the london branch of the florentine banking house of the bardi and , in 1498 , from henry vii the idea that richard amerike was an important supporter of cabot gained currency in the late 20th century among popular historians , as did the notion that amerike was owner and main funder of the matthew , cabot 's ship of 1497 indeed , they suggest that ap meryk may have been hostile to cabot because the terms of the explorer 's royal patent would have made it difficult for the port 's customs officers to profit from any trade established to new lands richard amerike did have one important responsibility towards john cabot in the mid-1890s edward scott , a 'keeper ' or senior archivist at the british museum , and from 1891 keeper of the muniments in westminster abbey , discovered a stray exchequer document that showed this process and two years-worth of pension payments to cabot by amerike and his colleague in 1497–1499 kemys and 'richard ap meryke ' or ' a meryk ' are named at the head of every section of the account in 1908 , the local bristol antiquarian alfred hudd first proposed the theory that the word america had evolved from amerike or ap meryk hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at 21 may 1908 meeting of the clifton antiquarian club , and which appeared in volume 7 of the club 's proceedings '' the man who inspired america ?
