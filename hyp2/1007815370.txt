engineers were faced with many challenges as airlines demanded more passenger seats per aircraft , longer ranges and lower operating costs after the success of the early wide-body aircraft , several subsequent designs came to market over the next two decades , including the boeing 767 and 777 , the airbus a330 and a340 , and the mcdonnell douglas md-11 although wide-body aircraft have larger frontal areas ( and thus greater form drag ) than narrow-body aircraft of similar capacity , they have several advantages over their narrow-body counterparts , such as : a larger cabin space for passengers , giving a more open feeling a lower ratio of surface area to volume , and thus lower drag per passenger or cargo volume greater under-floor freight capacity better structural efficiency for larger aircraft than would be possible with a narrow-body design british and russian designers had proposed wide-body aircraft similar in configuration to the vickers vc10 and douglas dc-9 , but with a wide-body fuselage as jet engine power and reliability have increased over the last decades , most of the wide-body aircraft built today have only two engines the maximum takeoff weight of the airbus a380 would not have been possible without the engine technology developed for the boeing 777 such as contra-rotating spools the trent 900 is designed to fit into a boeing 747-400f freighter for easier transport by air cargo the interiors of aircraft , known as the aircraft cabin , have been undergoing evolution since the first passenger aircraft today , between one and four travel class are available on wide-body aircraft bar and lounge areas which were once installed on wide-body aircraft have mostly disappeared , but a few have returned in first class or business class on the airbus a340-600 , 777-300er , and on the airbus a380 for example , aircraft scheduled for shorter flights are often configured at a higher seat density than long-haul aircraft in some of the largest single-deck wide-body aircraft , such as the boeing 777 , the extra space above the cabin is used for crew rest areas and galley storage due to their weight , all current wide-body aircraft are categorized as '' heavy '' , or in the case of the a380 in u.s other wide-body aircraft are used as flying research stations , such as the joint germanâ€“u.s two shuttle carrier aircraft were used to transport the u.s aircraft seat map competition between airbus and boeing large aircraft list of large aircraft narrow-body aircraft
