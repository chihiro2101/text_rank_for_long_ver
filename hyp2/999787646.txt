based on studies that looked only at molecular shape , for many years thujone was thought to act similarly to thc on the cannabinoid receptors ; barnaby conrad iii ; ( 1988 ) modulation of ionotropic gaba receptors by natural products of plant origin the median lethal dose , or ld 50 , of alpha-thujone , the more active of the two isomers , in mice , is around 45 & nbsp ; mg/kg , with 0 % mortality rate at 30 & nbsp ; mg/kg and 100 % at 60 & nbsp ; mg/kg side effects from the essential oil of this plant include anxiety , sleeplessness , and convulsions , which confirms the central nervous system effects of thujone in the past , absinthe was thought to contain up to 260–350 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone , absinthism : a fictitious 19th-century syndrome with present impact , padosch et al a 2008 study of 13 pre-ban ( 1895–1910 ) bottles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( gc-ms ) found that the bottles had between 0.5 and 48.3 & nbsp ; mg/l and averaged 25.4 & nbsp ; mg/l absinthe myths finally laid to rest chemical composition of vintage preban absinthe with special reference to thujone , fenchone , pinocamphone , methanol , copper , and antimony concentrations a 2005 study recreated three 1899 high-wormwood recipes and tested with gc-ms , and found that the highest contained 4.3 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone gc-ms testing is important in this capacity , because gas chromatography alone may record an inaccurately high reading of thujone as other compounds may interfere with and add to the apparent measured amount valentin_magnan , who studied alcoholism , tested pure wormwood oil on animals and discovered it caused seizures independent from the effects of alcohol based on this , absinthe , which contains a small amount of wormwood oil , was assumed to be more dangerous than ordinary alcohol 101-105 after absinthe was banned , research dropped off until the 1970s , when the british scientific journal nature published an article comparing the molecular shape of thujone to tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) , the primary psychoactive substance found in cannabis , and hypothesized it would act the same way on the brain , sparking the myth that thujone was a cannabinoid in the united states , the addition of pure thujone to foods is not permitted foods or beverages that contain artemisia species , white cedar , oak moss , tansy , or yarrow , must be thujone-free , fda regulation 21 cfr 172.510 – food additives permitted for direct addition to food for human consumption which in practice means that they contain less than 10 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone for example , sage and sage oil ( which can be up to 50 % thujone ) are on the food and drug administration 's list of generally recognized as safe ( gras ) substances absinthe offered for sale in the united states must be thujone-free by the same standard that applies to other beverages containing artemisia , so absinthe with small amounts of thujone may be legally imported piołunówka – polish alcoholic preparation with thujone content higher than in absinthe
