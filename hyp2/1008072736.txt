the form of the crucibles has varied through time , with designs reflecting the process for which they are used , as well as regional variation crucibles used for copper smelting were generally wide shallow vessels made from clay that lacks refractory properties which is similar to the types of clay used in other ceramics of the time lang , eds , mining and metal production through the ages , british museum press , london , pp93–100 ceramic crucibles from this time had slight modifications to their designs such as handles , knobs or pouring spouts ( bayley & rehren 2007 : p47 ) allowing them to be more easily handled and poured the main purpose of the crucible during this period was to keep the ore in the area where the heat was concentrated to separate it from impurities before shaping the use of crucibles in the iron age remains very similar to that of the bronze age with copper and tin smelting being used to produce bronze the roman period shows technical innovations , with crucibles for new methods used to produce new alloys the smelting and melting process also changed with both the heating technique and the crucible design 26 , pp 1083–1087 there are examples of larger vessels such as cooking pots and amphorae being used for cementation to process larger amounts of brass ; since the reaction takes place at low temperatures lower fired ceramics could be used the technology for this type of smelting started to change at the end of the medieval period with the introduction of new tempering material for the ceramic crucibles brass production increased during the medieval period due to a better understanding of the technology behind it , 1995 , early metal mining and production , edinburgh university press ltd , edinburgh however , during this period a vast and highly important technological innovation happened using the cementation process , the production of crucible steel the first examples of cementation steel are wootz steel from india ( craddock 1995 : p276 ) , where the crucibles were filled with good quality low-carbon wrought iron and carbon in the form of organics such as leaves , wood , etc however , no charcoal was used within the crucible these early crucibles would only produce a small amount of steel as they would have to be broken once the process has finished by the late medieval period , steel production had moved from india to modern-day uzbekistan where new materials were being used in the production of steel crucibles , for example , mullite crucibles were introduced smelting and melting crucibles types started to become more limited in designs which are produced by a few specialists these are triangular vessels made on a wheel or within a mold using high alumina clay and tempered with pure quartz sand , 2009 , post-medieval crucible production and distribution : a study of materials and materialities , archaeometry vol.51 no.1 pp49–74 furthermore , another specialized crucible which was made at the same time was that of a graphite crucible from southern germany the refining of methods during the medieval and post-medieval periods led to the invention of the cupel which resembles a small egg cup , made of ceramic or bone ash which was used to separate base metals from noble metals another vessel used for the same process is a scorifier which is similar to a cupel but slightly larger and removes the lead and leaves the noble metals behind these vessels were also used in the process of metallurgical assay where the noble metals are removed from a coin or a weight of metal to determine the amount of the noble metals within the object file : czochralski method crucibles.jpg thumb crucibles used in czochralski method 300x300px file : melting crucible.jpg thumb melting gold in a graphite crucible 300x300px file : menlo lab cruicibles.jpg thumb three crucibles used by thomas edison 300x300px crucible is used in the laboratory to contain chemical compounds when heated to extremely high temperatures crucibles and their lids can come in high form and low form shapes and in various sizes , but rather small 10 to 15 ml size porcelain crucibles are commonly used for gravimetric chemical analysis
