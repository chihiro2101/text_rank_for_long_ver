the k cat /k m of urease in the processing of urea is 10 14 times greater than the rate of the uncatalyzed elimination reaction of urea x-ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) studies of canavalia ensiformis ( jack bean ) , klebsiella aerogenes and sporosarcina pasteurii ( formerly known as bacillus pasteurii ) confirm 5â€“6 coordinate nickel ions with exclusively o/n ligation , including two imidazole ligands per nickel some amino acid residues are proposed to form mobile flap of the site , which gate for the substrate cysteine residues are common in the flap region of the enzymes , which have been determined not to be essential in catalysis , although involved in positioning other key residues in the active site appropriately the binding of urea to the active site of urease has not been observed this leaves a carbamate ion coordinated to the 5-coordinate ni , which is then displaced by a water molecule , regenerating the enzyme the carbamate produced then spontaneously degrades to produce another ammonia and carbonic acid in addition , the general acidic ligand required to protonate the urea nitrogen was not identified the mechanism follows the same path , with the general base omitted ( as there is no more need for it ) and his 320 donating its proton to form the ammonia molecule , which is then released from the enzyme as this histidine ligand is part of the mobile flap , binding of the urea substrate for catalysis closes this flap over the active site and with the addition of the hydrogen bonding pattern to urea from other ligands in the pocket , speaks to the selectivity of the urease enzyme for urea therefore , in this proposed mechanism , the positioning of urea in the active site is induced by the structural features of the active site residues which are positioned to act as hydrogen-bond donors in the vicinity of ni1 and as acceptors in the vicinity of ni2 these polyvalent ions are soluble but become insoluble when ammonia is produced from microbial urease during urea hydrolysis , as this increases the surrounding environments ph from roughly 6.5 to 9 in humans the microbial urease , proteus mirabilis , is the most common in infection induced urinary stones as the bacteria are localized to the stomach ammonia produced is readily taken up by the circulatory system from the gastric lumen in the absence of plants , urease activity in soil is generally attributed to heterotrophic microorganisms , although it has been demonstrated that some chemoautotrophic ammonium oxidizing bacteria are capable of growth on urea as a sole source of carbon , nitrogen , and energy by promoting the formation of calcium carbonate , ureases are potentially useful for biomineralization-inspired processes notably , micro-biologically induced formation of calcium carbonate can be used in making bioconcrete
