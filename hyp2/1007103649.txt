according to the belize institute of archaeology , the site 's name means '' rockstone water , '' and is a yucatec mayan approximation of the name of the nearby village of rockstone pond bullard conducted excavations led by the royal ontario museum , at baking pot and san estevan , and although no excavations took place , the site was initially called “ rockstone pond currently , the only recognizable natural water source is a creek beyond the northern limit of the mapped area the site may have contained two chultuns , but provenience is lost since they are used in modern times the zone c causeway does not connect to any structures , but is probably related to structure c13 , and was perhaps used for ceremonial purposes the earliest structures found at altun ha , found in zone c , are two round platforms that date to about bc 900−800 , structures c13 and c17 structure c13 was an early religious building , with zone c inhabitants being of relatively high status although this structure was constructed at the end of the preclassic , the majority of the archaeological evidence dates to the early classic one of the most important finds in the early classic comes from structure f8 , specifically tomb f8/1 the tomb was placed here about fifty years after the construction of the structure above the burial , however , the roof showed association to the large mexican site teotihuacan there is also evidence of contact and trading with the other side of mesoamerica in the intermediate area this is in part because many believed that gold was not naturally occurring in the maya area , but recent investigations have shown that placer gold can be found in the streams of the upland zone of western belize the maya most likely did not use metallurgy because of a lack of techniques , which may have been due to the fact that yellow in maya ideology represent dying plant life and crop failure this artifact is also identical with other artifacts of the cocle in central panama this discovery also shows that important trade networks were set up much earlier than previously thought 1970 tumbaga object from the early classic period , found at altun ha , british honduras ( belize ) in general , the elite burials at altun ha during the late classic can be characterized by large amounts of jade structure b-4 has tombs with many jade artifacts , including a large jade plaque with a series of twenty glyphs in the phase six construction level in the 1968 field season , after excavating many tombs in structure b-4 , also called the temple of the masonry altars , the seventh phase of construction revealed the most elaborate tomb at the site nicknamed “ the sun god ’ s tomb ” the sun god 's tomb marks the starting point for tomb construction in structure b-4 during the late classic period the unusual form of this tomb shows the distinctive cultural aspects of altun ha and the caribbean zone compared to the inland classic maya sites pendergast suggests that with so much jade found at the site , the jade head may have been carved at the site with imported jade the giant jade head also suggests that this small site had a strong status as a trade or ceremonial center pendergast suggests that this tomb contained a priest that was associated with the sun god and that structure b-4 was dedicated to this deity , based on this one artifact with so many artifacts associated with this tomb , it is clear that the male buried in here was of great importance the jester god argument is a better fit for what this person represented , which would also correlate with this being the first tomb constructed in structure b-4 two possible explanations for the context of this artifact are that the blade could have been produced long after the decline of teotihuacan , or was reused from an earlier time period the largest class is in communally built structures that were dedicated to public ritual , the second occurs in residential structures with usually a single-family focus the caches during this time period had a high scale of ceremonial value and made a forceful statement of the site 's prominence
