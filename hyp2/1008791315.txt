although print runs were often small it was common for a newspaper to be passed around a whole whereas the government and missionaries often used their newspapers as an educational tool – to inform māori of british laws and customs – the countered this with arguments for self-determination māori newspapers eagerly reported on events from overseas that showed groups such as the irish challenging british sovereignty to obtain home rule , 1983 , loosely based on events from te kooti 's war , 1987 , set in 1948 , looking at the threat of unemployment for a local māori community sidney moko mead

especially for a person of great in the classic period a higher proportion of were located inside than was the case after contact with europeans during the construction of important buildings , slaves were sometimes used as a sacrifice this practice was done in order to express the buildings ' significance and to secure the gods ' protection the traditional māori continued to be used in rural areas in particular well into the post-contact period even as late as 1849 george cooper , the assistant private secretary to george grey , described a village in the relatively affluent lower eastern waihou river area as '' a wretched place , containing about a dozen miserable raupo huts all tumbling to pieces '' as māori became familiar with european building construction and design they incorporated features such as chimneys and fireplaces and made use of bigger doorways and windows as well as sawn timber but even by the turn of the 19th century toilet facilities were often primitive , despite the urgings of the māori mps pomare and ngata who worked hard to improve the standard of māori dwellings over their many years in office the early european explorer and painter earle noted in 1827 that these diseases were common even in isolated inland districts such as taupo much later european doctors advocated investigation of the medicinal properties of plants commonly used in māori medicine they reasoned that they could influence māori more effectively after baptism and were subsequently successful in attracting many converts in the western hokianga district , away from the dominant cms influence early european reports suggest that māori children were indulged and led a carefree and playful life the concept of ( adopting or fostering children ) has been , and still is , important within māori historian paul moon writes of reports by missionaries of families forcing some of their young girls into the sex trade with the object of obtaining valuable and scarce english goods in the 1820s census figures in the 19th century showed a marked male/female imbalance throughout the north island amongst māori children in modern times , child abuse among māori has received a great deal of media attention when missionaries back in arrived in the bay of islands they realised that if they were going to introduce christianity and change what they considered to be barbaric practices like cannibalism , slavery , lewd dancing and having multiple wives , they would need to establish schools māori closely observed the natural world to take advantage of seasonal opportunities early european explorers reported that māori often ringed a garden with burning vegetation in an attempt to control caterpillars māori continued to use traditional fern roots — — as a normal part of their diet into the mid-19th century some of these tracks were used by many and were considered neutral territory between 1840 and 1850 numbers of explorers , artists , government officials including governor grey travelled inland with the aid of māori guides henry williams , who followed several war parties , reported as many as 50 waka taua travelling together at one time , although he reported they only went out to sea in relatively calm weather in the 1850s as māori with the active encouragement of grey embraced trade were gradually able to develop a large fleet of small trading schooners and similar craft māori paid customs duties to the government and invested heavily in vessels , so suffered considerably when a dramatic market slump hit new zealand especially effecting the auckland–waikato–hauraki area during the musket war period and for a time afterwards , maori , isolated from their tribal support by these devastating conflicts , hid in isolated places , living off patches of vegetables they grew in tiny gardens with the arrival of europeans māori gradually started to trust the value of british money and use it as a medium of exchange instead of goods this was rare before 1834 but became increasingly common as more māori worked as sailors on european ships , where they gained a good reputation as being strong capable workers northern māori learnt that they could more easily hide cash from their relatives avoiding the traditional obligatory sharing of goods with their the period 1835 to 1840 completed the revolution in the north māori economy with māori abandoning many of their former trading habits and adopting those of the europeans to the point where māori became dependent on the flow of european goods to maintain their new way of life this gave chiefs much more influence , especially after 1835 , because trade was so regular in pre-contact times the power of chiefs was never very great , largely being restricted to directing warfare he found that although they had some passing awareness of europeans—they seemed to know about firearms—the extent of their understanding was far less than that of the northern māori traditionally the resources the land held were controlled based on systems of ( power ) and ( ancestral right ) in many cases multiple groups would express a connection with the same important river or mountain oral tradition would record the migrations of groups from one area to another and their connection with an ancestral location in the early 19th century many europeans entered into dealings with māori to obtain land for their use in some cases settlers thought they were buying land to obtain equivalent to freehold title under british law ; māori claimed that the various deeds signed by māori were more limited and conditional , stopping short of outright alienation this and other interpretations of early 19th century new zealand land deals have been the source of much disagreement both within the waitangi tribunal process and outside it 394 māori , especially after 1830 , were eager to have europeans living on their land under their protection so they could benefit from european knowledge and trade settlers allowed māori to stay on the land they had '' bought '' and often continued to give presents to tribal chiefs , often prompted by the chiefs themselves , in order to maintain friendly relationships another reason for māori to '' sell '' land to missionaries was to protect the title of the land from other tribal competitors the settlers and the government also had very limited access to trained surveyors and even freehold land boundaries were ill-defined surveying was a relatively new skill and involved much hard physical work especially in hill country the native lands act was a policy enforced by the government in 1865 , which allowed the māori people to obtain individual titles for their land to sell this act abolished the traditional shared landholdings and made it easier for european settlers to directly purchase land for themselves each generation of leaders were judged based on their ability to progress a land claim from the time of their arrival in new zealand , māori lived in tribes that functioned independently under the leadership of their own chiefs from about 1853 māori began reviving the ancient tribal or chiefly war councils where land issues were raised and in may 1854 a large meeting – attracting as many as 2000 māori leaders – was held at manawapou in south taranaki where speakers urged concerted opposition to selling land it was believed that by having a monarch who could claim status similar to that of queen victoria , māori would be able to deal with pākehā ( europeans ) on equal footing it was also intended to establish a system of law and order in māori communities to which the auckland government had so far shown little interest though there was widespread respect for the movement 's efforts in establishing a '' land league '' to slow land sales , pōtatau 's role was strongly embraced only by waikato māori , with of north auckland and south of waikato showing him scant recognition today , the māori monarch is a non-constitutional role with no legal power from the perspective of the new zealand government this continued through the contact period and was expressed during the 20th century by large groups of volunteers in the first and second world wars
