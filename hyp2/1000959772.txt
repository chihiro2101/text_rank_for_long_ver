a detailed study of the quantum geometry of a black hole horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity however , the results obtained are subject to the usual restriction that a truncated classical theory , then quantized , might not display the true behaviour of the full theory due to artificial suppression of degrees of freedom that might have large quantum fluctuations in the full theory no spacetime is assumed a priori , but rather it is built up by the states of theory themselves – however scattering amplitudes are derived from n -point functions ( correlation function ) and these , formulated in conventional quantum field theory , are functions of points of a background space-time the relation between the background-independent formalism and the conventional formalism of quantum field theory on a given spacetime is far from obvious , and it is far from obvious how to recover low-energy quantities from the full background-independent theory one would like to derive the n -point functions of the theory from the background-independent formalism , in order to compare them with the standard perturbative expansion of quantum general relativity and therefore check that loop quantum gravity yields the correct low-energy limit in conventional quantum field theory , this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory ; it does so in quantum gravity as well , but in a fully background–independent manner in contrast , loop quantum gravity , like general relativity , is manifestly background independent , eliminating the background required in string theory loop quantum gravity , like string theory , also aims to overcome the nonrenormalizable divergences of quantum field theories lqg differs from string theory in that it is formulated in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or kaluza-klein extra dimensions , while the latter requires both to be true in a 2003 paper '' a dialog on quantum gravity '' , carlo rovelli regards the fact lqg is formulated in 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry as a strength of the theory as it represents the most parsimonious explanation , consistent with current experimental results , over its rival string/m-theory proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that , among other things , it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits , which loop quantum gravity has struggled to do it is possible to extend mainstream lqg formalism to higher-dimensional supergravity , general relativity with supersymmetry and kaluza–klein extra dimensions should experimental evidence establish their existence many of these problems apply to lqg , including : can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory ( perhaps as a quantum field theory ) ? is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete ? would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton , or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself ( as in loop quantum gravity ) ? are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity theory ? the theory of lqg is one possible solution to the problem of quantum gravity , as is string theory on the other hand , the consequences of lqg are radical , because they fundamentally change the nature of space and time and provide a tentative but detailed physical and mathematical picture of quantum spacetime this means it remains unproven that lqgs description of spacetime at the planck scale has the right continuum limit ( described by general relativity with possible quantum corrections ) other technical problems include finding off-shell closure of the constraint algebra and physical inner product vector space , coupling to matter fields of quantum field theory , fate of the renormalization of the graviton in perturbation theory that lead to ultraviolet divergence beyond 2-loops ( see one-loop feynman diagram in feynman diagram ) while there has been a proposal relating to observation of naked singularity , and doubly special relativity as a part of a program called loop quantum cosmology , there is no experimental observation for which loop quantum gravity makes a prediction not made by the standard model or general relativity ( a problem that plagues all current theories of quantum gravity )
