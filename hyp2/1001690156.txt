in the problems of this category , some input is given and the corresponding output needs to be constructed or found polygon triangulation : given a polygon , partition its interior into triangles mesh generation boolean operations on polygons the computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by the time and space ( computer memory ) required to solve a given problem instance in geometric query problems , commonly known as geometric search problems , the input consists of two parts : the search space part and the query part , which varies over the problem instances some fundamental geometric query problems are : range searching : preprocess a set of points , in order to efficiently count the number of points inside a query region ray tracing : given a set of objects in space , produce a data structure that efficiently tells which object a query ray intersects first if the search space is fixed , the computational complexity for this class of problems is usually estimated by : the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in the time ( and sometimes an extra space ) to answer queries for the case when the search space is allowed to vary , see '' dynamic problems '' yet another major class is the dynamic problems , in which the goal is to find an efficient algorithm for finding a solution repeatedly after each incremental modification of the input data ( addition or deletion input geometric elements ) any of the computational geometric problems may be converted into a dynamic one , at the cost of increased processing time for example , the range searching problem may be converted into the dynamic range searching problem by providing for addition and/or deletion of the points the computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by : the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in the time and space to modify the searched data structure after an incremental change in the search space the time ( and sometimes an extra space ) to answer a query
