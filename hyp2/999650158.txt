the government-funded abc could not hope to match a commercial network 's bid , but they were awarded another three-year contract worth only 210,000 , commencing with the 1976–77 season determined to get some cricket on channel nine , packer put an offer to the test and county cricket board ( tccb ) to telecast the australian cricket team in england in 1977 packer took this idea , then fleshed it out into a full series between the best australian players and a team from the rest of the world in early 1977 , he began contracting a list of australian players provided by recently retired australian test captain ian chappell a bigger coup was achieved when packer convinced the england captain tony greig to not only sign on , but to act as an agent in signing many players around the world by the time the season climaxed with the centenary test match between australia and england at the melbourne cricket ground in march 1977 , about two dozen players had committed to packer 's enterprise , which as yet had no grounds to play on , no administration and was secret to all in the cricket world by the time the australian team arrived to tour england in may 1977 , thirteen of the seventeen members of the squad had committed to packer it seemed certain that all packer players would be banned from test and first class cricket the australian players were a divided group and the management made their displeasure clear to the packer signees in light of the controversies the sydney gazette article clearly showed west indian captain clive lloyd interviewed after leaving the caribbean team to join packer , lloyd stated it was nothing personal it was clearly earning a more comfortable source of income after ninety minutes of compromise from both sides had almost created common ground , packer demanded that the icc award him the exclusive australian television rights after the 1978–79 season ended the icc decided to treat packer 's scheme with contempt when a month later they decided packer 's matches would not be given first-class status and the players involved would be banned from test match and first class cricket the cricket authority 's counsel said that if the top players deserted traditional cricket then gate receipts would decline english county cricket teams were pleased as their players who had signed to play for packer were still eligible to play for them left official cricket won a series of minor victories – packer was unable to use the terms '' test match '' or call their team of australians '' australia '' , or use the official rules of cricket , which are the copyright of the marylebone cricket club however , wsc used the west indian players in the world team as well the official test match played in brisbane at the same time , featuring the weakened australian team and india , attracted far more spectators wsc decided to place a greater emphasis on one-day cricket than it had previously been given in australia the first day/night match , played at melbourne 's vfl park , attracted some curiosity value , but generally the paying public were indifferent to the series many took a lead from the hostile press , and official cricket benefited from a dramatic test series played between australia and a touring indian team he led a team of relatively unknown youngsters ( with the exception of fast bowler jeff thomson , who did not sign up for the wsc ) to a 3–2 series victory which was not decided until the final test in adelaide the best attended matches had been the day-night fixtures , and this format would become the backbone of the programming for the second season the west indies cricket officials had no wish to buy into the acb-packer fight and decided to select all of their wsc players for the first two tests , until the wicb made a decision to leave out three of their wsc contracted players for the 3rd test , ostensibly to allow others a chance to play in test matches prior to the west indies ' tour to india and sri lanka later in the year , which would be at a time that world series cricket could not guarantee the availability of their west indian players the non-selection of these three players led to the resignation of clive lloyd as captain , and all of the wsc contracted west indian players to declare themselves unavailable for the rest of the series the highest ill-feeling toward packer existed in england , but many officials of the county clubs were prepared to keep packer players on their books initially , pakistan took a hard line and refused to select their packer players , but when wsc signed additional pakistanis during the off season , and when an under-strength official pakistan team were easily beaten by england in the three test series in the english summer of 1978 , they took a more pragmatic approach , so when it came time in october 1978 for the first test series between pakistan and india for seventeen years , all the packer players were included now he had no objection to wsc making a brief tour of his country in november , nor was he going to stop the kiwis ' best player , his son richard , from appearing with wsc some were prepared to acclaim south africa as the best side of the world on the basis of the performances of some of their players in wsc after organising the tours of new zealand and the west indies , wsc began making noises about a tour to england and signing enough players for stand-alone england and pakistan teams thumb a second tier tour was created for the 1978–79 season , taking the game to provincial centres around australia and giving back-up players an opportunity to play regularly these matches brought cricket to venues that rarely saw big games packer demonstrated his political clout by getting new south wales premier neville wran to overturn the ban on wsc and allow matches to be played at the traditional home of the game , the sydney cricket ground ( scg ) the war swung dramatically in packer 's favour on 28 november 1978 when the first day-night match on a traditional cricket ground was played at the scg between the wsc australian and west indian teams the sixth australia-england test at the same venue a week later was attended by just 22,000 people for four days of play later in the season , the acb scheduled two tests against pakistan , which brought the number of tests played by australia to eight wsc then headed to the caribbean for a tense , hard fought series that players from both australia and west indies declared the best they ever played in the feeling in many quarters was that when the australian board first found packer at their throats , the rest of the cricket world supported them to the hilt ; even to the extent of highly expensive court cases which cricket could ill afford the wsc australian players ( on tour in west indies at the time ) had no input into the negotiations the acb opted to not select wsc-contracted players for the tours of england ( for the 1979 world cup ) and india ( for six tests ) later in the year australia 's results were mixed : in the test matches , they defeated england 3–0 ( having lost 5–1 to the same opponents the previous summer ) but lost 0–2 to west indies , and they failed to make the final of the one-day tournament world series cricket changed the game in many ways night matches have become very common in most nations , and one-day cricket has become the most widely followed form of the game ( though this is being threatened by twenty20 cricket ) the popular '' c'mon aussie c'mon '' single , which reached the top of the charts , and a world series cricket autograph book however , the traditional form of the game , test cricket , is still played around the world , and in recent seasons has challenged one-day cricket for the interest of the public indeed , membership of a test cricket side is often seen as being more prestigious for players , due both to the more challenging nature of the format and to the higher turnover rate of one day players many of wsc 's players fitted back into the official australian side , though a handful of players from outside wsc remained at the highest level , most notably allan border the acb continued to use the name '' world series cup '' to describe the one day international tournament it held during each summer , usually involving australia and two other international teams austin robertson when he was promoting his book cricket outlaws stated how much the directors were paid for world series cricket golden press ( 1978 ) : '' cricket alive ! world series cricket , the first exciting year '' , macarthur press
