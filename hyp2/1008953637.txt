lusatia comprises two both scenically and historically different parts : a hilly southern '' upper '' section and a '' lower '' region , which belongs to the north european plain upper lusatia ( oberlausitz or hornja łužica ) is today part of the german state of saxony , except for a small part east of the neisse river around lubań , which now belongs to the polish lower silesian voivodeship it consists of hilly countryside rising in the south to the lusatian highlands near the czech border , and then even higher to form the zittau hills , the small northern part of the lusatian mountains ( lužické hory/lausitzer gebirge ) in the czech republic many villages in the very south of upper lusatia contain a typical attraction of the region , the so-called umgebindehäuser , half-timbered-houses representing a combination of franconian and slavic style most of the area belonging to the german state of brandenburg today is called lower lusatia ( niederlausitz or dolna łužyca ) and is characterised by forests and meadows between upper and lower lusatia is a region called the grenzwall , literally meaning '' border dyke '' , although it is in fact a morainic ridge the city of cottbus is the largest in the region , and though it is recognized as the cultural capital of lower lusatia , it was a brandenburg exclave since 1445 since 1945 , when a small part of lusatia east of the oder–neisse line was incorporated into poland , żary has been touted as the capital of polish lusatia from around 600 onwards , west slavic tribes known as the milceni and lusici settled permanently in the region until 963 the lusatian tribes were subdued by the saxon margrave gero and upon his death two years later , the march of lusatia was established on the territory of today 's lower lusatia and remained with the holy roman empire , while the adjacent northern march again got lost in the slavic uprising of 983 around 1200 , large numbers of german settlers came to lusatia in the course of the ostsiedlung , settling in the forested areas yet not inhabited by the slavs in 1346 six upper lusatian cities formed the lusatian league to resist the constant attacks conducted by robber barons according to the 1635 peace of prague , most of lusatia became a province of the electorate of saxony , except for the region around cottbus possessed by brandenburg the lusatians in prussia demanded that their land become a distinct administrative unit , but lower lusatia was incorporated into the province of brandenburg , while the upper lusatian territories were attached to the province of silesia instead poland 's communist government expelled all remaining germans and sorbs from the area east of the neisse river during 1945 and 1946 in 1945 , the northeastern part of upper lusatia west of the neisse rejoined saxony and in 1952 , when the state was divided into three administrative areas ( bezirke ) , the upper lusatian region became part of the dresden administrative region after the east german revolution of 1989 , the state of saxony was reestablished in 1990 at the same time , the large german-speaking majority of the upper lusatian population kept up a considerable degree of local , 'upper lusatian ' patriotism of its own however , the number of all the inhabitants of this part of eastern saxony is declining rapidly - by 20 % in the last 10 to 15 years the number of sorbs in lusatia has decreased since the 1900 census due to intermarriage , germanization , cultural assimilation related to industrialisation and urbanisation , nazi suppression and discrimination , ethnocide and the settlement of expelled germans after world war ii , mainly from lower silesia and northern bohemia
