5-limit tuning yields a much larger number of wolf intervals with respect to pythagorean tuning , which can be considered a 3-limit just intonation tuning it is also important to note that the two fifths , three minor thirds , and three major sixths marked in orange in the tables ( ratio 40/27 , 32/27 , and 27/16 ( or g− , e♭− , and a+ ) , even though they do not completely meet the conditions to be wolf intervals , deviate from the corresponding pure ratio by an amount ( 1 syntonic comma , i.e five-limit tuning also creates two impure perfect fifths of size 40:27 ( about 680 cents ; less pure than the 3:2 pythagorean perfect fifth ) these are not diminished sixths , but relative to the pythagorean perfect fifth they are less consonant ( about 20 cents flatter ) and hence , they might be considered to be wolf fifths this is also true for any perfect fourth or perfect fifth which slightly deviates from the perfectly consonant 4:3 or 3:2 ratios ( for instance , those tuned using 12-tone equal or quarter-comma meantone temperament ) the very intrepid may simply want to treat it as a xenharmonic music interval ; depending on the size of the meantone fifth it can be made to be exactly 20:13 or 17:11 , or less commonly to 32:21 or 49:32 with a more extreme meantone temperament , like 19 equal temperament , the wolf is large enough that it is closer in size to a sixth than a fifth , and sounds like a different interval altogether rather than a mistuned fifth top image : rank-2 temperaments with the generator close to a fifth and period an octave.jpg right 250px thumb figure 2 : the syntonic temperament ’ s tuning continuum on an isomorphic keyboard , any given musical interval has the same shape wherever it appears — in any octave , key , and tuning — except at the edges for example , on wicki 's keyboard , from any given note , the note that is a tempered perfect fifth higher is always up-and-rightwardly adjacent to the given note the note that is a tempered perfect fifth higher than e is b , which is not included on the keyboard shown ( although it could be included in a larger keyboard , placed just to the right of a , hence maintaining the keyboard 's consistent note-pattern ) however , such edge conditions produce wolf intervals only if the isomorphic keyboard has fewer buttons per octave than the tuning has enharmonically distinct notes in these latter tunings , using electronic transposition could keep the current key 's notes centered on the isomorphic keyboard , in which case these wolf intervals would very rarely be encountered in tonal music , despite modulation to exotic keys
