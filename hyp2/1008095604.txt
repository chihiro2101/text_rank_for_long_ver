when writing about controversies in the lead section of a biography , relevant material should neither be suppressed nor allowed to overwhelm : always pay scrupulous attention to reliable sources , and make sure the lead correctly reflects the entirety of the article they are not usually used in running text , though some may be appropriate in the lead sentence of a biographical article , as detailed below , or in a section about the person 's titles and styles in general , honorific prefixes—styles and honorifics in front of a name—in wikipedia 's own voice should not be included , but may be discussed in the article in burmese names , honorifics may be preserved if they are part of the normal form of address , even for ordinary people except for the initial reference and infobox , do not add honorific titles to existing instances of a person 's name where they are absent , because doing so implies that the existing version is incorrect ( similar in spirit to the wikipedia : manual of style ( spelling ) ) similarly , honorific titles should not be deleted when they are used throughout an article unless there is consensus honorific titles used with forenames only ( such as '' sir elton '' , '' sir david '' , '' dame judi '' ) should be avoided unless this form is so heavily preferred in popular usage that the use of the surname alone would render the entire name unrecognizable not all non-honorary inductees into an order of chivalry are entitled to use the pre-nominal titles , either , and may receive distinct post-nominals when making the change upon the death of a subject , the entire article should be reviewed for consistency correct – correct – incorrect – historical events should be written in the past tense in all biographies : the present tense may be used when discussing the work of a writer or philosopher , even if they are dead : when making any statements about current events , use the '' as of '' template ; for example , '' as of april 2011 '' or '' in april 2011 '' if you 're giving a precise date range from the past to the present , as with a living person 's age or career , you may use the '' age '' template in general , present a biography in chronological order , from birth to death , except where there is good reason to do otherwise
