pepsin is expressed as a zymogen called pepsinogen , whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids compared to the active enzyme hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment , which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion , thereby generating pepsin ( the active form ) accordingly , its primary site of synthesis and activity is in the stomach ( ph 1.5 to 2 ) at the mean ph of the laryngopharynx ( ph 6.8 ) pepsin would be inactive but could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting in damage to local tissues exposure of laryngeal mucosa to enzymatically active pepsin , but not irreversibly inactivated pepsin or acid , results in reduced expression of protective proteins and thereby increases laryngeal susceptibility to damage upon cellular uptake , pepsin is stored in intracellular vesicles of low ph at which its enzymatic activity would be restored such exposure to pepsin at neutral ph and endocyctosis of pepsin causes changes in gene expression associated with inflammation , which underlies signs and symptoms of reflux , and tumor progression pepsin in airway specimens is considered to be a sensitive and specific marker for laryngopharyngeal reflux a rapid non-invasive pepsin diagnostic called peptest is now available which determines the presence of pepsin in saliva samples pepsin may be inhibited by high ph ( see activity and stability ) or by inhibitor compounds pepstatin is a low molecular weight compound and potent inhibitor specific for acid proteases with a ki of about 10 âˆ’10 m for pepsin the statyl residue of pepstatin is thought to be responsible for pepstatin inhibition of pepsin ; statine is a potential analog of the transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases pi-3 occupies the active site of pepsin using its n-terminal residues and thereby blocks substrate binding pepsin is commonly used in the preparation of f ( ab ' ) 2 fragments from antibodies for these applications , antibodies may be enzymatically digested to produce either an fab or an f ( ab ' ) 2 fragment of the antibody in tissues such as lymph nodes or spleen , or in peripheral blood preparations , cells with fc receptors ( macrophages , monocytes , b lymphocytes , and natural killer cells ) are present which can bind the fc region of intact antibodies , causing background staining in areas that do not contain the target antigen
