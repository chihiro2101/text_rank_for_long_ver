thumb countercurrent exchange along with cocurrent exchange and contra-current exchange comprise the mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them thumb in the cocurrent flow exchange mechanism , the two fluids flow in the same direction with equal flows in the two tubes , this method of exchange is only capable of moving half of the property from one flow to the other , no matter how long the exchanger is thumb a cocurrent heat exchanger is an example of a cocurrent flow exchange mechanism a thermoconductive membrane or an open section allows heat transfer between the two flows at the input end , there is a large temperature difference of 40 & nbsp ; °c and much heat transfer ; at the output end , there is a very small temperature difference ( both are at the same temperature of 40 & nbsp ; °c or close to it ) , and very little heat transfer if any at all the system consists of two tubes , one with brine ( concentrated saltwater ) , the other with freshwater ( which has a low concentration of salt in it ) , and a semi permeable membrane which allows only water to pass between the two , in an osmosis many of the water molecules pass from the freshwater flow in order to dilute the brine , while the concentration of salt in the freshwater constantly grows ( since the salt is not leaving this flow , while water is ) once that happens , there will be no more flow between the two tubes , since both are at a similar dilution and there is no more osmotic pressure for example , this could be transferring heat from a hot flow of liquid to a cold one , or transferring the concentration of a dissolved solute from a high concentration flow of liquid to a low concentration flow so , for example , in the case of heat exchange , the exiting liquid will be almost as hot as the original incoming liquid 's heat a minute but existing heat difference still exists , and a small amount of heat is transferred , so that the water leaving the bottom pipe is at close to 60 & nbsp ; °c at the cold end—the water exit from the top pipe , because the cold water entering the bottom pipe is still cold at 20 & nbsp ; °c , it can extract the last of the heat from the now-cooled hot water in the top pipe , bringing its temperature down nearly to the level of the cold input fluid ( 21 & nbsp ; °c ) if the two flows are not equal , for example if heat is being transferred from water to air or vice versa , then , similar to cocurrent exchange systems , a variation in the gradient is expected because of a buildup of the property not being transferred properly for example , fish use it in their gills to transfer oxygen from the surrounding water into their blood , and birds use a countercurrent heat exchanger between blood vessels in their legs to keep heat concentrated within their bodies a countercurrent multiplication loop is a system where fluid flows in a loop so that the entrance and exit are at similar low concentration of a dissolved substance but at the far end of the loop there is a high concentration of that substance the system allows the buildup of a high concentration gradually , by allowing a natural buildup of concentration towards the tip inside the in-going tube , ( for example using osmosis of water out of the input pipe and into the buffer fluid ) , and the use of many active transport pumps each pumping only against a very small gradient , during the exit from the loop , returning the concentration inside the output pipe to its original concentration the incoming flow starting at a low concentration has a semipermeable membrane with water passing to the buffer liquid via osmosis at a small gradient the buffer liquid between the two tubes is at a gradually rising concentration , always a bit over the incoming fluid , in this example reaching 1200 & nbsp ; mg/l the returning tube has active transport pumps , pumping salt out to the buffer liquid at a low difference of concentrations of up to 200 & nbsp ; mg/l more than in the tube there is no need for a buffer liquid , if the desired effect is receiving a high concentration at the output pipe a circuit of fluid in the loop of henle—an important part of the kidneys allows for gradual buildup of the concentration of urine in the kidneys , by using active transport on the exiting nephrons ( tubules carrying liquid in the process of gradually concentrating the urea ) the semipermeable membrane of the thin descending limb does not permit passage of ions or large dissolved molecules gradually there is a buildup of osmotic concentration , until 1200 mosm is reached at the loop tip , but the difference across the membrane is kept small and constant the thin ascending limb 's membrane does not permit free passage of any substance including water pumps further up the thin ascending limb , pump out from 400 mosm into liquid at 600 mosm , so again the difference is retained at 200 mosm from the inside to the outside , while the concentration both inside and outside are gradually decreasing as the liquid flow advances : the liquid finally reaches a low concentration of 100 mosm when leaving the thin ascending limb and passing through the thick one water or liquid with very low osmotic concentration leaving the nephrons is reabsorbed in the peritubular capillaries and returned to the blood as these fluids flow past each other , they create a heat gradient in which heat is transferred and retained inside the body although the fluid in the tubules is with a higher concentration of salt than the blood , the flow is arranged in a countercurrent exchange , so that the blood with a high concentration of salt enters the system close to where the gland tubules exit and connect to the main canal thus , all along the gland , there is only a small gradient to climb , in order to push the salt from the blood to the salty fluid with active transport powered by atp the blood supply system to the gland is set in countercurrent exchange loop mechanism for keeping the high concentration of salt in the gland 's blood , so that it does n't leave back to the blood system heat is supplied at the bottom , known as a '' reboiler '' and cooling is done with a condenser at the top image : coflore acx.png thumb left 120px counter flow in liquid-liquid extraction liquid-liquid extraction ( also called 'solvent extraction ' or 'partitioning ' ) is a common method for extracting a substance from one liquid into another liquid at a different 'phase ' ( such as '' slurry '' ) thumb cement may be created using a countercurrent kiln where the heat is passed in the cement and the exhaust combined , while the incoming air draft is passed along the two , absorbing the heat and retaining it inside the furnace , finally reaching high temperatures
