in late august 1777 , after a distressing 34-day journey from sandy hook on the coast of new jersey , a royal navy fleet of more than 260 & nbsp ; ships carrying some 17,000 british troops under the command of british general sir william howe landed at the head of the elk river , on the northern end of the chesapeake bay near present-day elkton , maryland ( then known as head of elk ) , approximately 40–50 & nbsp ; miles ( 60–80 & nbsp ; km ) southwest of philadelphia general george washington had placed the american forces , about 20,300-strong , between head of elk and philadelphia washington employed general john armstrong , commanding about 1,000 pennsylvania militia , to cover pyle 's ford , 5.8 miles south of chadds ford , which was covered by major generals anthony wayne 's and nathanael greene 's divisions major general john sullivan 's division extended northward along the brandywine 's east banks , covering the high ground north of chadds ford along with major general adam stephen 's division and major general lord stirling 's divisions the remainder of howe 's troops , about 9,000 men , under the command of charles , lord cornwallis , marched north to trimble 's ford across the west branch of the brandywine creek , then east to jefferies ford across the east branch ( two fords that washington had overlooked ) , and then south to flank the american forces washington received contradictory reports about the british troop movements and continued to believe that the main force was moving to attack at chadds ford the british continued to advance and encountered a greater force of continentals behind the stone walls on the old kennett meetinghouse grounds and took a much-needed rest on osbourne 's hill , a commanding position north of the continental army having received intelligence from colonel bland 's scouts , washington ordered sullivan to take overall command of stirling and stephen 's divisions ( in addition to his own ) and quickly march north to meet the british flank attack having taken overall command of the right wing of the army , sullivan left his division to confer with the other generals his own division he left under the command of preudhomme de borre , with orders to shift to the right in order to link up with stirling and stephen 's divisions ( from left to right the divisions were arranged as sullivan , stirling , stephen ) howe was slow to attack , which bought time for the americans to position some of their men on high ground near birmingham meetinghouse , about a mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) north of chadds ford the british brigade of guards caught de borre by surprise on the american left , before de borre had time to fully form , and immediately sent them in to disarray , causing the entire division to rout however , the british light infantry battalions , aided by the jaegers , eventually caused stephen 's division to fall back greene 's reinforcements , combined with the remnants of sullivan 's , stephen 's , and stirling 's divisions , formed south of dilworth and stopped the pursuing british for nearly an hour , letting the rest of the army retreat when darkness fell , greene 's division finally began the march to chester along with the rest of the army the americans were also forced to leave behind many of their cannons on meeting house hill because almost all of their artillery horses were killed upon hearing the attack of cornwallis 's column , knyphausen launched an attack against the weakened american center across chadds ford , breaking through the divisions commanded by wayne and william maxwell and forcing them to retreat and leave behind most of their cannons further north , greene sent brigadier general george weedon 's troops to cover the road just outside the town of dilworth to hold off the british long enough for the rest of the continental army to retreat the american retreat was well organized , largely because of the efforts of lafayette , who , although wounded , created a rally point that allowed for a more orderly retreat before being treated for his wound the nearest thing to a hard figure from the american side was by major general nathanael greene , who estimated that washington 's army had lost between 1,200 and 1,300 & nbsp ; men 109 on september 14 , about 350 wounded americans were taken from the british camp at dilworth to a newly established hospital at wilmington , delaware in addition to losses in battle , 315 men were posted as deserters from washington 's camp during this stage of the campaign although howe had defeated the american army , his lack of cavalry prevented its total destruction washington had committed a serious error in leaving his right flank wide open and could have brought about his army 's annihilation had it not been for sullivan , stirling and stephen 's divisions , which bought them time '' british and american forces maneuvered around each other for the next several days with only a few encounters such as the battle of paoli on the night of september 20–21 ) and one active regular army field artillery battalion ( 1–5th fa ) are derived from american units that participated in the battle of brandywine stephen 's division deployed on the far right flank of the continental army
