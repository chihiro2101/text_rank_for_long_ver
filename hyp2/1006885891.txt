standard german originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region but as a written language developed over a process of several hundred years in which writers tried to write in a way that was understood in the largest area until about 1800 , standard german was almost entirely a written language people in northern germany who spoke mainly low saxon languages very different from standard german then learned it more or less as a foreign language however , later the northern pronunciation ( of standard german ) was considered standard and spread southward ; in some regions ( such as around hanover ) , the local dialect has completely died out with the exception of small communities of low german speakers it is thus the spread of standard german as a language taught at school that defines the german sprachraum , which was thus a political decision rather than a direct consequence of dialect geography on the other hand , the '' standard '' written languages of switzerland and austria have each been codified as standards distinct from that used in germany for this reason , '' hochdeutsch '' or '' high german '' , originally a mere geographic designation , applies unproblematically to swiss standard german and austrian german as well as to german standard german and may be preferred for that reason all varieties of standard german are based on the common tradition of the written german language , whereas the local dialects have their own historical roots that go further back than the unification of the written language , and in the case of low german , belong to a different language entirely however , there are two ( or three ) exceptions : in northern germany , there is no continuum in the strict sense between the local indigenous languages and dialects of low german ( '' plattdeutsch '' ) on the one hand , and standard german on the other high german and low german are best seen as separate languages , but because high , middle , and low german form a dialect continuum and standard german serves as dachsprache for all forms of german , they are often described as dialects of german however , low german did influence the standard-based vernaculars spoken today in northern germany by language transfer ( in pronunciation , vocabulary , grammar , and syntax ) , and it continues to do so to a limited degree in german-speaking switzerland , there is no such continuum between the swiss german varieties and swiss standard german , and the use of standard german is almost entirely restricted to the written language standard german is seldom spoken among native swiss , and even then the accent and vocabulary is very much swiss , except for instance when speaking with people who do not understand the swiss german dialects at all , and it is expected to be used in school standard german has , however , left a clear imprint on the contemporary variants of swiss german , regional expressions and vocabulary having been replaced with material assimilated from the standard language
