'' ( the portuguese reached beyond the 55th degree of the other pole , where one may observe certain nebulae revolving around the point i.e that is , nebulae appear in or beside the milky way throughout its entire length in the southern sky '' ( '' here we saw a marvelous arrangement of stars , so that in the part of heaven that is opposite our north celestial pole , in order to know in what place and degree of latitude the south celestial pole was , we measured our position during the day using the sun , and observed our position during the night using an astrolabe , and saw clearly two clouds of reasonable bigness revolving around the location of the southern celestial pole , continually now rising and now falling , thus maintaining their continual course of circular motion , with a star always in the middle between them , which revolves with them about 11 degrees from the south celestial pole 66 : '' the antarctic pole is not so covered with stars as the arctic , for there are to be seen there many small stars congregated together , which are like to two clouds a little separated from one another , and a little dimmed , linda hall library ; retrieved on 2009-09-05 herschel in 1847 from cape observatory south africa spent 4 years writing a 400-page report detailing over a thousand of the many stars , nebulae and clusters which constitute the cloud which appeared to be a separate more distant group to the usual stars in the milky way , an early indication of separate galaxy one recent estimate of the total mass of the lmc is about 1/10 that of the milky way that would make the lmc rather a large galaxy in the current observable universe in terms of rank , the lmc appears to be the fourth most massive member of over 50 galaxies in the local group suggesting that the magellanic cloud system is historically not a part of the milky way is evidence that the smc has been in orbit about the lmc for a very long time the magellanic system seems most similar to the distinct ngc 3109 system , which is on the edge of the local group astronomers have long assumed that the magellanic clouds have orbited the milky way at approximately their current distances , but evidence suggests that it is rare for them to come as close to the milky way as they are now aside from their different structure and lower mass , they differ from our galaxy in two major ways aa.springer.de retrieved on 2007-05-31 both are noted for their nebulae and young stellar populations , but as in our own galaxy their stars range from the very young to the very old , indicating a long star formation history measurements with the hubble space telescope , announced in 2006 , suggest the magellanic clouds may be moving too fast to be long term companions of the milky way the existence of this star cluster suggests that the leading arm of the magellanic clouds is 90,000 light-years away from the milky wayâ€”closer than previously thought visvanathan proposed that the smc may in fact be split in two , with a smaller section of this galaxy behind the main part of the smc ( as seen from earth 's perspective ) , and separated by about 30,000 light years
