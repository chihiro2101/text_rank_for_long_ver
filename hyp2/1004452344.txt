the general electric laboratories in schenectady , new york experimented with making still and motion picture records of television images in 1931 some of the surviving live transmissions of the nazi german television station fernsehsender paul nipkow , dating as far back as the 1930s , were recorded by pointing a 35mm camera to a receiver 's screen , although most surviving nazi live television programs such as the 1936 summer olympics ( not to confuse with the cinematic footage made during the same event by leni riefenstahl for her film olympia ) , a number of nuremberg rally , or official state visits ( such as benito mussolini 's ) were shot directly on 35mm instead and transmitted over the air as a television signal , with only a two minutes ' delay from the original event , by means of the so-called zwischenfilmverfahren ( see intermediate film system ) from an early production truck on the site the films were produced by aiming a camera at television monitors – at a speed of eight frames per second , resulting in somewhat jerky reproductions of the images even after the introduction of videotape , the bbc and the itv companies made black and white kinescopes of selected programs for international sales , and continued to do so until the early 1970s by which time programs were being videotaped in colour most , if not all , videotapes from the 405-line era have long since been wiped as have many from the introduction of 625-line video to the early days of colour cbs and nbc instituted a '' hot kinescope '' process in 1952 , where shows being performed in new york were transmitted west , filmed on two kinescope machines in 35 & nbsp ; mm negative and 16 & nbsp ; mm reversal film ( the latter for backup protection ) in los angeles , rushed to film processing , and then transmitted from los angeles three hours later for broadcast in the pacific time zone to save the time to make a print , the 35 mm negative was broadcast , and electronically converted to a positive image in september 1956 , nbc began making color '' hot kines '' of some of its color programs using a lenticular film process which , unlike color negative film , could be processed rapidly using standard black-and-white methods programs originally shot with film cameras ( as opposed to kinescopes ) were also used in television 's early years , although they were generally considered inferior to the big-production '' live '' programs because of their lower budgets and loss of immediacy but as an article in american cinematographer explained , : in the beginning there was a very definite reason for the decision of desilu productions to put i love lucy on film instead of doing it live and having kinescope recordings carry it to affiliate outlets of the network it saw that film , produced especially for television , was the only means of ensuring top quality pictures on the home receiver as well as ensuring a flawless show the corresponding film segments from the various cameras then were combined by a film editor to duplicate the live program the '' classic 39 '' syndicated episodes of the honeymooners were filmed using electronicam ( as well as the daily five-minute syndicated series les paul & mary ford in 1954–55 ) , but with the introduction of a practical videotape recorder only one year away , the electronicam system never saw widespread use in 1951 , singer bing crosby ’ s company bing crosby enterprises made the first experimental magnetic video recordings ; however , the poor picture quality and very high tape speed meant it would be impractical to use offering high quality and instant playback at a much lower cost , quadruplex tape quickly replaced kinescope as the primary means of recording television broadcasts a recording of a 1975 episode of australian series this day tonight is listed on the national archives of australia website as a kinescope , while surviving episodes of the 1978 drama series the truckies also exist as kinescopes , indicating that the technology was still being used by abc at that point up until the early 1960s , much of the bbc 's output , and british television in general , was broadcast live , and telerecordings would be used to preserve a programme for repeat showings , which had previously required the entire production being performed live for a second time secondly , they could be used in any country regardless of the television broadcasting standard , which was not true of videotape thirdly , the system could be used to make black and white copies of color programs for sale to television stations who were not yet broadcasting in color the telerecording system could be of a very high quality , easily reproducing the full detail of the television picture one side effect of the system was that it removed the 'fluid ' look of interlaced video and 'filmized ' the picture although some color telerecordings were made , they were generally in the minority as by the time color programs were widely needed for sale , video standards conversion was easier and higher quality and the price of videotape had become much reduced before videotape became the exclusive transmission format during the early to mid-1980s , any ( color ) video recordings used in documentaries or filmed program inserts were usually transferred onto film in the 1950s a home telerecording kit was introduced in britain , allowing enthusiasts to make 16 mm film recordings of television programs the major drawback , apart from the short duration of a 16 & nbsp ; mm film magazine , was that a large opaque frame had to be placed in front of the tv set in order to block out any stray reflections , making it impossible to watch the set normally while filming although domestic use of telerecording in the uk for repeat broadcasts dropped off sharply after the move to color in the late 1960s , 16 & nbsp ; mm black and white film telerecordings were still being offered for sale by british broadcasters well into the 1970s another occasional use of telerecording into the late 1980s was by documentary makers working in 16 & nbsp ; mm film who wished to include a videotape-sourced excerpt in their work , although such use was again rare kinescopes were also used for some live television programs , like captain kangaroo , when back-to-back episodes were made in a day for different time zones a 35 & nbsp ; mm or 16 & nbsp ; mm camera exposes one frame of film for every one frame of television ( 525 lines ) , and moving a new frame of film into place during the time equivalent of one field of television ( 131.25 lines ) in the british 405-line television system , the french 819-line television system and the greater european 576i , television ran at 25 frames—or more correctly , 50 fields—per second , so the film camera would also be run at 25 frames per second rather than the cinematic film standard of 24 frames therefore , in order to maintain successful kinescope photography , a camera must expose one frame of film for exactly 1/30th or 1/25th of a second , the time in which one frame of video is transmitted , and move to another frame of film within the small interval of 1/120 of a second in some instances , this was accomplished through means of an electronic shutter which cuts off the tv image at the end of every set of visible lines using this shutter , in 1 second of video ( 60 fields equaling 30 frames ) , 48 television fields ( totaling to 24 frames of video ) would be captured on 24 frames of film , and 12 additional fields would be omitted as the shutter closed and the film advanced because television is a field- rather than frame-based system , however , not all the information in the picture can be retained on film in the same way as it can on videotape the time taken physically to move the film on by one frame and stop it so that the gate can be opened to expose a new frame of film to the two fields of television picture is much longer than the vertical blanking interval between these fields—so the film is still moving when the start of the next field is being displayed on the television screen a simpler system , less prone to breakdown , was to suppress one of the two fields in displaying the television picture this left the time during which the second field would have been displayed for the film camera to advance the film by one frame , which proved sufficient the resulting film thus consisted of fewer than 200 lines of picture information , so as a result the line structure was very apparent ; the missing field information also made movement look very 'jerky ' a development on the suppressed field system was to display the image from one of the fields at a much higher intensity on the television screen during the time when the film gate was closed , and then capture the image as the second field was being displayed it also prevented moiré patterns appearing when the resulting film was re-broadcast on television , which occurred if the line structure on the film recording did not precisely match the scanning lines of the electronic film scanner an additional problem was that the whole procedure took place in an open room and it was known for insects to settle on the screen which were then permanently present on the film recording for kinescopes , 16 & nbsp ; mm film was the common choice by most studios because of the lower cost of stock and film processing , but in the larger network markets , it was not uncommon to see 35 & nbsp ; mm kinescopes , particularly for national rebroadcast fine grain release positive film , type 7302 ( high-contrast ) for direct positive recordings and single system sound recordings using variable area sound the standard was later changed for color tv to 59.94 fields/s in recent years , the bbc has introduced a video process called vidfire , which can restore kinescope recordings to their original frame rate by interpolating video fields between the film frames certain performers or production companies would require that a kinescope be made of every television program kinescopes continued to be made after video-tape was introduced to australia ; most existing episodes of the 1965–1967 children 's series magic circle club are kinescopes ( per listings for episodes on national film and sound archive website )
