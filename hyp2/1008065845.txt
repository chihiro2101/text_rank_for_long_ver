the term performance poetry originates from an early press release describing the 1980s performance poet hedwig gorski , whose audio recordings achieved success on spoken word radio programs around the world voicing american poetry : sound and performance from the 1920s to the present gorski , an art school graduate , tried to come up with a term that would distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art , especially the work of performance artists , such as laurie anderson , who worked with music at that time she began using the term , however , to describe a 1978 '' neo-verse drama '' and '' conceptual spoken poetry for five voices '' titled booby , mama ! that employs the cut-up method made popular by william burroughs and conceptual art methods some of the best original austin performance poets and performing poets who went on to national and international notoriety include ra√∫lrsalinas , konstantyn k by the 1990s the general poetry public was less interested in the beat poets of the 1950s and 1960s venues like nuyorican poets cafe in new york city and mass media formats , like gorski 's and john giorno 's , form the two lines of influence leading to def poetry on hbo as gorski often states , broadcast and technology surpass books in reaching mass audiences for poetry , and just as writing poetry for print made poetry a completely different artform since the invention of the book , audio '' mediums influence the way poets write just as they do painters and sculptors '' the public performance of poetry became generally restricted , at least in a european context , to the staging of plays in verse and occasionally , for example in the cases of the elizabethan madrigalists or robert burns , as texts for singing cobbing 's groups bird yak and konkrete canticle involved collaborative performance with other poets and musicians and were partly responsible for drawing a number of the poets of the british poetry revival into the performance arena however , most people would not consider the poetry readings of this type as part of the performance poetry phenomena this leaves three types of poetry performance : poems written specifically for performance on the jerome rothenberg model and poems like those of david antin that are composed during performance another type based on the beat method of reading their print poems is poetry with music while ginsberg sang his blake songs with a harmonium , the original practitioner of this third and most popular type of performance poetry is hedwig gorski , who coined the term performance poetry to describe her work with music that is the key to gorski 's performance poetry : the marriage of poetry to music written specifically to fit poems written for vocal performance the other type of performance poetry gorski practiced is without music and tied to conceptual art , but that was at appearances in smaller venues that could not accommodate her band however , the increasing popularity of open mics , which allow '' unknown '' poets to take the stage and share their own work in 3- to 5-minute increments and of poetry slams has meant that performance poetry is now one of the most widespread forms of popular poetry even though the beats did not use the term '' performance poetry '' to categorize their work with music and audio recordings , the beats provided an immediate model for the work of hedwig gorski it is worth noting that gorski , who coined the term '' performance poetry '' to describe her poems written only for performance , recordings , and broadcast usually with her musical band east of eden band , is the only woman , besides patti smith , in this group of late twentieth-century innovators reviving oral poetry the poetry slam is a competitive live performance format founded by poet marc smith in chicago , which has become a hotbed for performance poetry this adds to the vitality of american performance poetry and connects to the social protest of beat poets like allen ginsberg however , the emergence of performed poetry as a popular art form can probably be linked to allen ginsberg 's stunning performance at the albert hall in 1965 at the international poetry incarnation these developments were also connected to the emergence of the liverpool poets , which referred mainly to the poets roger mcgough , adrian henri and brian patten who fired up audiences across the uk in the 70s and then the likes of john hegley emerged in the 80s , influenced as much by stand-up comedy as a love for wordplay , creating the template for what became recognised as contemporary british performance poetry - a format still exemplified by the work of acts such as murray lachlan young , francesca beard and gerard mckeown in the 90s , however , in big cities like manchester and london , a different style emerged that was influenced more by hip hop with much less emphasis on comedy in the manner of def poets in the united states developments such as shadowork represent a 'counter-cultural ' mode of performance poetry which shuns bald entertainment value , and others such as the tell tales initiative and jonzi d 's lyrikal fearta ( which he calls choreo-poetry '' a specialist in a form of theatre that he dubs choreo-poetry , jonzi d has no qualms about shaping what was a street-based art form for the stage '' go even further , extending spoken word to short prose productions and fusing performance poetry with dance media works influenced by radio performance poet hedwig gorski have gained ground ; lesley wheeler , voicing american poetry : sound and performance from the 1920s to the present
