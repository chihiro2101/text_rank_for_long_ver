virtual economies also exist in life simulation games which may have taken the most radical steps toward linking a virtual economy with the real world this can be seen , for example , in second life 's recognition of intellectual property rights for assets created '' in-world '' by subscribers , and its laissez-faire policy on the buying and selling of linden dollars ( the world 's official currency ) for real money on third party websites virtual economies can also exist in browser-based internet games where '' real '' money can be spent and user-created shops opened , or as a kind of emergent gameplay in some cases , the resource exists for public view even when its owner is not logged into the virtual world it also took advantage of the global reach of synthetic worlds by setting up a shop in hong kong where a small army of technically savvy but low wage workers could field orders , load up avatars , retrieve store goods and deliver them wherever necessary this lucrative market has opened a whole new type of economy where the border between the real and the virtual is obscure such trading of real money for virtual goods simply represents the development of virtual economies where people come together where the real and the synthetic worlds are meeting within an economic sphere although virtual markets may represent a growth area , it is unclear to what extent they can scale to supporting large numbers of businesses , due to the inherent substitutability of goods on these markets plus the lack of factors such as location to dispense demand however , the application of these economic measures to a virtual world may be inappropriate where poverty is merely virtual and there is a direct relationship between in-game wealth and time spent playing however , the secondary market is unlikely to have followed the growth of the primary market since 2007 seeing as game companies have become better at monetizing on their games with microtransactions and many popular games such as world of warcraft are sporting increased measures against player to player real money trading as for an actual economic model , secondary market turnover in popular player vs player oriented mmorpgs without trade restrictions such as runescape , eve online and ultima online has been estimated at around 1.1 dollar per concurrent player and day many online games , particularly those that use the freemium model , offer at least one additional form of currency beyond its standard one , called premium currency this created a virtual economy around the game , as certain customization items carried status and recognition , giving them a perceived social value status this created a virtual economy around items in the game , as some rare items , known as '' unusuals '' by the game community due to various special effects applied , and are seen as having high social value , had traded for as high as , and because of the active trading that incorporated real-world money , valve hired economist yanis varoufakis to help manage this however , as counter-strike gained favor as an esport , these skins became part of a larger skin gambling scheme , where grey market websites , integrated with steam 's features , could allow players to use skins to gamble on the results of counter-strike esport events , and later just using skins to play game of chance such games offer the means for players to acquire in-game resources which players may then sell or trade with other players , craft into gear which can be sell or traded , and otherwise create an virtual marketplace within the game above and beyond in-game stores established by the developer this economy may also mix with real-world currency , with players trading in-game items through external websites to the game eve online is a prime example of online game with a vast player-driven economy that , in 2014 , was estimated to have a total virtual value of based on the trading of the in-game currency player-driven economies have led to immaterial labor activities , such as gold farming in world of warcraft , where some players are paid in real-world funds to spend the time to acquire in-game wealth for other players being able to exchange real money for virtual currency provides the player purchasing power for virtual commodities in addition to taxing income from transactions involving real currency or assets , there has been considerable discussion involving the taxation of transactions that take place entirely within a virtual economy as with the above skin gambling concerns , conversion between in-game and real-world currency has led to direct comparisons with other online games of chance as 'virtual winnings ' when queried about games where real-world transactions for in-game assets are not permitted , but there is an 'unofficial secondary market ' , chapman responded : '' ultimately the point is whether the thing that you win has value in money or money â€™ s worth monetary issues can give a virtual world problems similar to those in the real world a 2007 virtual heist has led to calls from some community members in second life to bring in external regulation of these markets : '' in late july , a perpetrator with privileged information cracked a stock exchange 's computers , made false deposits , then ran off with what appears to be the equivalent of us 10,000 , disappearing into thin air '' in eve online however , theft and scamming other players is perfectly allowed within the game 's framework as long as no real world trading is committed to control real money trading , eve online created an official and sanctioned method to convert real world cash to in-game currency ; players can use real world money to buy a specific in-game item which can be redeemed for account subscription time or traded on the in-game market for in-game currency a game 's synthetic economy often results in interaction with a '' real '' economy ; characters , currency , and items may be sold and bought on online auction websites or purchased from standalone webshops since january 2007 users are no longer allowed to sell virtual goods of online games on ebay due to the ambiguous legal status of real world trading while many game developers , such as blizzard ( creator of world of warcraft ) , prohibit the practice , it is common that goods and services within virtual economies will be sold on online auction sites and traded for real currencies since players of these games are willing to substitute real economic resources of time and money ( monthly fees ) in exchange for these resources , by definition they have demonstrated utility to the user robert bridenbecker , vice president of online technologies at blizzard , explained that the intent behind the effort is largely to reduce account thefts resulting from player interaction with third-party sites firstly , the developers of the games often consider themselves as trying to present a fantasy experience , so the involvement of real world transactions takes away from it , in a game of monopoly between friends , offering another player a real dollar in exchange for a property on the board ) ; and for this to be necessary or valuable may indicate a kingmaker scenario within the game another issue is the impact of taxation that may apply if in-game items are seen as having real value since a developer may change the virtual world any time , ban a player , delete items , or even simply take the world down never to return , the issue of their responsibility in the case where real money investments are lost through items being lost or becoming inaccessible is significant however , second life has shown a legal example which may indicate that the developer can be in part held responsible for such losses second life at one stage , offered and advertised the ability to '' own virtual land '' , which was purchased for real money
