john strype ( 1710 ) , life and acts of edmund grindal , archbishop of canterbury however modern scholarship has shown that his birthplace was in fact cross hill house , st bees , cumberland grindal himself described his birthplace in a letter to sir william cecil , elizabeth i 's secretary of state : '' the house wherein i was born , and the lands pertaining thereto , being a small matter , under twenty shillings rent , but well builded at the charges of my father and brother '' : which corresponds to cross hill house edwin sandys kept one step behind grindal in their subsequent careers , succeeding him as bishop of london , and then as archbishop of york whatever the place of early education , it is known that the marian martyr john bland was the schoolmaster of sandys , so it is likely he would also have taught grindal probably through the influence of nicholas ridley , who had been master of pembroke hall , grindal was selected as one of the protestant disputants during the visitation of 1549 grindal was soon promoted to be one of king edward vi 's chaplains and prebendary of westminster , and in october 1552 was one of six to whom the forty-two articles were submitted for examination before being sanctioned by the privy council however , only a month later edward vi was dead , and very soon catholicism would return under mary i although grindal was not politically compromised by the events surrounding the accession of mary i in october 1553 , he had resigned his westminster prebend by 10 may 1554 , and made his way to strasbourg as one of the marian exiles in july 1559 he was elected master of pembroke hall in succession to the recusant thomas young ( 1514 ? â€“1580 ) and finally created bishop of london in succession to edmund bonner , six years after his first nomination in edward 's reign 269 and in october 1562 he wrote to william cecil , begging to know '' if that second julian , the king of navarre , is killed ; as he intended to preach at st paul 's cross , and might take occasion to mention god 's judgements on him '' london , which was always a difficult see , involved bishop sandys in similar troubles when grindal had gone to york in 1570 grindal became archbishop of york , where puritans were few and coercion would be required mainly for roman catholics his first letter from his residence at cawood to cecil told that he had not been well received , that the gentry were not '' well-affected to godly religion and among the common people many superstitious practices remained he must have given general satisfaction , for even before parker 's death two persons so different as cecil ( now lord burghley ) , and dean nowell independently recommended grindal 's appointment as his successor , and edmund spenser spoke warmly of him in the shepheardes calender as the '' gentle shepherd algrind '' grindal was appointed archbishop of canterbury on 26 july 1575 , though there is no actual proof that the new archbishop ever visited the seat of his see , canterbury , not even for his enthronement john milton , who rejected episcopal church government , thought the elizabethan bishops had been laodiceans , neither hot nor cold , but thought grindal had been '' the best of them '' in his tract of reformation of 1641 henry sacheverell , in his famous sermon of 5 november 1709 , '' the perils of false brethren , both in church and state '' , attacked him as '' that false son of the church , bishop grindall however , in 1979 was published the first critical biography of grindal , by patrick collinson , who said that grindal was neither weak nor ineffectual but had the support of his fellow bishops and led the way for how the english church would develop in the early 17th century nicholas copland was nominated by grindal as the first headmaster and a tradition of learning had begun which continued without a break for over four centuries
