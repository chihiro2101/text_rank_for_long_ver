he observed halley 's comet in 1835 from landulph and the following year started to make his own astronomical calculations , predictions and observations , engaging in private tutoring to finance his activities on 3 july 1841 , he noted his intention to work on the problem but it is also notable ( and not included in some of the foregoing discussion references ) that adams himself publicly acknowledged le verrier 's priority and credit ( not forgetting to mention the role of galle ) in the paper that he gave 'on the perturbations of uranus ' to the royal astronomical society in november 1846 : adams held no bitterness towards challis or airy and acknowledged his own failure to convince the astronomical world : however , pembroke college , which possessed greater freedom , elected him in the following year to a lay fellowship which he held for the rest of his life despite the fame of his work on neptune , adams also did much important work on gravitational astronomy and terrestrial magnetism would please to observe , with due care , the phases of the moon 's eclipses at bagdat , aleppo and alexandria , thereby to determine their longitudes , they could not do the science of astronomy a greater service : for in and near these places were made all the observations by which the mean motions of the sun and moon are limited : and i could then pronounce in what proportion the moon 's motion does accelerate ; which that it does , i think i can demonstrate later , during the eighteenth century , richard dunthorne estimated the rate as +10 '' ( arcseconds/century 2 ) in terms of the resulting difference in lunar longitude , -- also given in philosophical transactions ( abridgements ) ( 1809 ) , vol.9 ( for 1744–49 ) , pp small terms integral in time come to have large effects and adams concluded that plana had overestimated the secular acceleration by approximately 1.66 '' per century however , he soon recanted , publishing a third result different both from adams 's and plana 's own earlier work delaunay in 1859 calculated the fourth-order term and duplicated adams 's result leading adams to publish his own calculations for the fifth , sixth and seventh-order terms later that year , philippe gustave doulcet , comte de pontécoulant published a claim that the tangential force could have no effect though peter andreas hansen , who seems to have cast himself in the role of arbitrator , declared that the burden of proof rested on pontécoulant , while lamenting the need to discover a further effect to account for the balance much of the controversy centred around the convergence of the power series expansion used and , in 1860 , adams duplicated his results without using a power series adams 's view was ultimately accepted and further developed , winning him the gold medal of the royal astronomical society in 1866 two years later he succeeded challis as director of the cambridge observatory , a post adams held until his death left the great meteor shower of november 1866 turned his attention to the leonids , whose probable path and period had already been discussed and predicted by hubert anson newton in 1864 ten years later , george william hill described a novel and elegant method for attacking the problem of lunar motion adams briefly announced his own unpublished work in the same field , which , following a parallel course had confirmed and supplemented hill's again , the calculations involved great labour , and were not published during his lifetime they were edited by his brother , william grylls adams , and appear in the second volume of the collected scientific papers a catalogue of the portsmouth collection of books and papers written by or belonging to sir isaac newton , the scientific part of which has been presented by the earl of portsmouth to the university of cambridge , drawn up by the syndicate appointed 6 november 1982 , cambridge : cambridge university press , 1888 the post of astronomer royal was offered him in 1881 , but he preferred to pursue his teaching and research in cambridge 1847 he is reputed to have been offered a knighthood on queen victoria 's 1847 cambridge visit but to have declined , either out of modesty , or fear of the financial consequences of such social distinction ; 1847 foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences ; 1848 copley medal of the royal society ; 1848 adams prize , founded by the members of st john 's college , to be given biennially for the best treatise on a mathematical subject ; 1849 elected fellow of the royal society of london and honorary fellow of the royal society of edinburgh ; 1851 and 1874 president of the royal astronomical society ( 1851–1853 and 1874–1876 ) sampson ( 1900 ) lectures on the lunar theory , london : cambridge university press a collection , virtually complete , of adams 's papers regarding the discovery of neptune was presented by mrs adams to the library of st john 's college , see : sampson ( 1904 ) , and also : '' the collected papers of prof
