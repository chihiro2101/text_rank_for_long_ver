whether such downloads have substantially affected the retail sales of music , videos , and other works protected by copyright and the intellectual property laws is a matter of debate the key issue in the copyright infringement case was the so-called '' sony safe-harbor '' principle that was set by the supreme court over 21 years previously in sony v the riaa and mpaa argued that sony safe-harbor requires proof that the non-infringing use is the primary one ; an incidental non-infringing use is not enough thus , since downloading the bible through peer-to-peer file sharing software is an addition to the list of well-established legitimate methods for obtaining a free bible , the benefits of this addition are not substantial and the overall use of p2p software should not be considered a non-infringing use '' the creative commons organization presented a strong argument for non-infringing use in the form of the creative commons licence , despite the fact that the architecture of the software did not allow for the licence information to be transferred this ex post , or after-the-fact , test for contributory infringement would greatly increase the legal uncertainty surrounding the decision to pursue commercialization of a new technology emerging technology companies can not necessarily predict the '' primary uses '' to which their new technology will be put , much less whether those uses would be held by the courts to be infringing uses in april 2003 , los angeles federal judge stephen wilson ruled in favor of grokster and streamcast ( providers of morpheus p2p software ) against the recording industry association of america and the motion picture association of america and held that their file sharing software was not illegal on 17 august 2004 , the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit issued a partial ruling supporting grokster , holding this appeal presents the question of whether distributors of peer-to-peer file-sharing networking software may be held contributorily or vicariously liable for copyright infringements by users but the future impact of the case may only be to require software companies to more carefully advertise their packages to discourage illegal downloading ( see also inducement rule ) a note on its home page cited a united states supreme court ruling that copying copyrighted material using '' unauthorized peer-to-peer services is illegal '' and while legal download services exist , '' this service is not one of them prosecution of such individuals relies upon what has commonly been referred to as a process of doe subpoena in which prosecutors are required to gain a series of subpoenas in order to find out the identity of the user behind the ip address in question research into the effects of warnings such as the one left on grokster â€™ s website has shown that while these warnings can result in a substantial reduction in online file sharing of individuals , the overall availability of downloadable content did not diminish furthermore , researchers can not account for how much of this reduction in individual file sharing is simply shifted to other file sharing programs
