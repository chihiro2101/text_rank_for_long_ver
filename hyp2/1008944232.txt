the movement of the armature is used to provide a mechanical force to some mechanism , such as controlling a pneumatic valve these solenoids , whether axial or rotary , employ a flux carrying geometry that both produces a high starting force ( torque ) , and has a section that quickly begins to saturate magnetically the solenoid can be useful for positioning , stopping mid-stroke , or for low velocity actuation ; especially in a closed loop control system focusing of the magnetic field and its attendant flux metering , as illustrated in the sae paper , is required to produce a high starting force at the start of the solenoid stroke and to maintain a level or declining force as the solenoid moves through its displacement range further incrementing of the plunger causes a continuing decrease of the solenoid force thus creating an ideal condition for motion control as controlled by the current to the solenoid coil the rotary solenoid has a similar appearance to a linear solenoid , except that the armature core is mounted in the center of a large flat disk , with three inclined raceways coined into the underside of the disk this device allowed proportional , quiet positioning as well as a rapid rotation for uses such as mail sorters and conveyor gating typically the fixed magnet is on the outside , and the coil part moves in an arc controlled by the current flow through the coils the working part of a galvanometer is also a type of rotary voice coil that pivots around the pointer axis , a hairspring is usually used to provide a weak nearly linear restoring force a pneumatic solenoid valve is a switch for routing air to any pneumatic device , usually an actuator , allowing a relatively small signal to control a large device solenoid-controlled valves are often used in irrigation systems , where a relatively weak solenoid opens and closes a small pilot valve , which in turn activates the main valve by applying fluid pressure to a piston or diaphragm that is mechanically coupled to the main valve transmission solenoid control fluid flow through an automatic transmission and are typically installed in the transmission valve body if a starter solenoid receives insufficient power from the battery , it will fail to start the motor and may produce a rapid , distinctive '' clicking '' or '' clacking '' sound
