on may 31 , 1997 , an issue of the popular science magazine new scientist said that the international raëlian movement was starting a company to fund the research and development of human cloning ( highlight ) on december 19 , 1998 , a new scientist article said the cost of clonaid cloning services would be 200,000 , much lower than the 2.3 million that researchers at texas a & m university planned to use for cloning a dog named missy mainstream scientists said it was unlikely that clonaid would be able to clone anything in the near future although the project 's ultimate objective was human cloning , boisselier said that pet cloning would help finance the operations the first pending clone , according to vorilhon at the time , was the couple 's 10-month-old girl , who had died due to a medical mistake brigitte boisselier anticipated that the work could begin on the preserved cells as soon as october , but there was no evidence that clonaid had medical knowledge necessary for its success if fact , all claims of cloning are not legitimate as there has not been any verification or evidence that show that a successful clone has been made as of late 2018 due to clonaid 's association with raëlians and the lack of evidence for cloning , authorities remained skeptical as to whether clonaid could clone anything at all boisselier did not present the mother or child , or dna samples that would allow for confirmation of her claim at the press conference it has subsequently become apparent that she announced the birth before genetic testing to evaluate whether the child in question is actually a clone : dr an official company statement revealed that three korean women applied to become surrogate mothers officials of biofusion tech told the prosecutors that 10 korean women wanted to clone themselves and have filled out applications the food and drug administration stated its intention to investigate clonaid to see if it had done anything illegal panos zavos , a former professor of the university of kentucky , at the time had plans to create human clone embryos , but he stated to the effect that clonaid 's claims were without merit and that eve did not exist '' robert lanza of advanced cell technologies said that clonaid has no record of accomplishment for cloning anything , but he said that if clonaid actually succeeded , there would be public unrest that may lead to the banning of therapeutic cloning , which has the capacity to cure millions of patients the christian coalition of america urged a human cloning ban and saw the alleged clone baby as an '' aberration '' arthur caplan , the director of the center for bioethics at the university of pennsylvania , expressed concerns that many dead and sick children could result from the cloning of human beings boisselier said that eve would travel to the united states that day for dna tests she said that a pediatrician saw eve and her mother in good condition , but she refused to mention the location of the surrogate birth , the testing lab , or the biological mother 's home , which she wanted to reveal at a later time he believed the child , if she existed , needed an appointed guardian and would need extensive medical treatment which he doubts clonaid could offer however , clonaid prevented scientists from meeting the purported child and mother clonaid refused to identify the independent experts , because if revealed too soon , others could track the baby from the testing place into the mother 's house clonaid said the parents had the final say on whether they want to test the baby and that a dutch lesbian couple would be the parents of the next cloned baby boisselier said she would hand over the evidence to show that a clone had in fact been born but was concerned that the details of clonaid 's cloning procedure might leak out he said those who are against cloning for ethical reasons would be dismayed if the clone baby was in good condition the company said that before the tests were done , the parents wanted to be sure that their baby would not be sent away , but florida attorney bernard siegel asked that a guardian for eve be appointed and threatened the company with a lawsuit the day after boisselier made her announcement , she added that four more human clones were to be born within a few weeks , clonaid claims of human clone scoffed at by most scientist , cnn international an official from the dutch health ministry told reuters that the netherlands forbade human cloning but not the birth of baby clones on 5 january 2003 , brigitte boisselier said to the bbc that her medical team produced hundreds of human clone embryos before proceeding to ten implantations , two of which led to births the head of the uk roslin institute was critical of the assertion , '' clonaid has no track record but claims to have cloned hundreds of embryos – it just does n't ring true according to boisselier , mark and tracy hunt , who were seeking to clone their dead son , invested 500,000 in the former clonaid lab in west virginia and its equipment , which the food and drug administration shut down in late july 2002 , clonaid 's branch in south korea , biofusion tech , said a woman became pregnant with a human clone to help clarify the matter , clonaid lends one to a british science museum—under strict orders not to open it to find out what 's inside regardless , people continue to be surprised that clonaid appears to have overcome those problems ; either clonaid has been extremely lucky in discovering a superior method of cloning , or the company is making false claims clonaid has not shown verifiable evidence of any human cloning , despite claims that they would do this within days of their initial announcement they claim that the parents of the first cloned child had second thoughts about submitting their child to scientific tests after attorney bernard siegel filed suit boisselier revealed that in a strict sense , clonaid was just the product name , even though clonaid 's website the first human cloning company , clonaid.com
