these inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage increasingly large farms npk fertilizers stimulated the first concerns about industrial agriculture , due to concerns that they came with side effects such as soil compaction , soil erosion , and declines in overall soil fertility , along with health concerns about toxic chemicals food chain ( ebook } the discovery of vitamins and their role in nutrition , in the first two decades of the 20th century , led to vitamin supplements , which in the 1920s allowed some livestock to be raised indoors , reducing their exposure to adverse natural elements there are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture , and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides , which has given rise to the organic movement and has built a market for sustainable intensive farming , as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology it is commonly used to reverse pasture degradation , a process characterized by loss of forage and decreased animal carrying capacity which results from overgrazing , poor nutrient management , and lack of soil conservation depending on the productivity goals of the target agricultural system , more involved restoration projects can be undertaken to replace invasive and under-productive grasses with grass species that are better suited to the soil and climate conditions of the region these intensified grass systems allow higher stocking rates with faster animal weight gain and reduced time to slaughter , resulting in more productive , carbon-efficient livestock systems these synergies between these systems provide benefits to pastures through optimal plant usage , improved feed and fattening rates , increased soil fertility and quality , intensified nutrient cycle , integrated pest control , and improved biodiversity pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements , but rotational grazing is especially effective because grazers thrive on the more tender younger plant stems with the increased productivity of rotational systems , the animals may need less supplemental feed than in continuous grazing systems animal welfare and the intensification of animal production : an alternative interpretation , food and agriculture organization of the united nations , 2005 '' history of factory farming '' , united nations : '' fifty years ago in europe , intensification of animal production was seen as the road to national food security and a better diet why the organic revolution had to happen , the observer , april 21 , 2001 : '' nor is a return to 'primitive ' farming practices the only alternative to factory farming and highly intensive agriculture in a year which has been as uneventful on the husbandry side as it has been significant in economic and political developments touching the future of food procurement , the more far-seeing would name the growth of intensive farming as the major development permitted substances for the production of organic foods '' , food and agriculture organization of the united nations : '' 'factory ' farming refers to industrial management systems that are heavily reliant on veterinary and feed inputs not permitted in organic agriculture cafos have dramatically increased the production of food from animal husbandry worldwide , both in terms of total food produced and efficiency the united states environmental protection agency identified certain animal feeding operations , along with many other types of industry , as '' point source '' groundwater polluters the green revolution transformed farming in many developing countries photosynthate investment in the stem is reduced dramatically in shorter plants and nutrients become redirected to grain production , amplifying in particular the yield effect of chemical fertilizers crop rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants a related technique is to plant multi-species cover crops between commercial crops crop irrigation accounts for 70 % of the world 's fresh water use , '' water resources : agricultural and environmental issues '' , bioscience 54.10 ( oct 2004 ) , p909 flood irrigation , the oldest and most common type , is typically unevenly distributed , as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often based on plant hormones intensive farming practices which are thought to be sustainable have been developed to slow the deterioration of agricultural land and even regenerate soil health and ecosystem services these developments may fall in the category of organic farming , or the integration of organic and conventional agriculture this intensive system yields equivalent farmer profits ( partly from increased livestock forage ) while building new topsoil and sequestering up to 33 tons of co2/ha/year there are also challenges to farmers relying on farming equipment optimized for monoculture , often resulting in increased labor inputs an integrated farming system is a progressive , sustainable agriculture system such as zero waste agriculture or integrated multi-trophic aquaculture , which involves the interactions of multiple species elements of this integration can include : intentionally introducing flowering plants into agricultural ecosystems to increase pollen-and nectar-resources required by natural enemies of insect pests oregon state university – integrated farming systems – insectary plantings – enhancing biological control with beneficial insectary plants using crop rotation and cover crops to suppress nematodes in potatoes oregon state university – integrated farming systems – nematode suppression by cover crops integrated multi-trophic aquaculture is a practice in which the by-products ( wastes ) from one species are recycled to become inputs ( fertilizers , food ) for another the challenges and issues of industrial agriculture for society , for the sector , and for animal rights , include the costs and benefits of both current practices and proposed changes to those practices industrial agriculture uses huge amounts of water , energy , and chemical industry , increasing pollution in the arable land , usable water , and atmosphere industrial agricultural practices are one of the main drivers of global warming , accounting for 14–28 % of net greenhouse-gas emissions many of the negative effects of industrial agriculture may emerge at some distance from fields and farms but other adverse effects show up within agricultural production systems—for example , the rapidly developing resistance among pests renders herbicides and insecticides increasingly ineffective '' many of the negative effects of industrial agriculture are remote from fields and farms but other adverse effects are showing up within agricultural production systems—for example , the rapidly developing resistance among pests rendering our arsenal of herbicides and insecticides increasingly ineffective office of technology assessment concluded that regarding industrial agriculture , there is a '' negative relationship between the trend toward increasing farm size and the
