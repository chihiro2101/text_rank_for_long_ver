they say 'you either believe it or not , this is the way it is ' and that 's not the way the world works when it first came out , we all liked it , you know ? we were little kids and we thought 'yeah , this is a great idea , it 'll piss people off ' you know , when you 're fifteen years-old , the first thing you think about is 'how can i piss people off ? ' , you know ? and it 's very good to but as you get a little older , or as i 've gotten older , i 've looked back on the symbol of bad religion as still having some meaning , but i wish it was n't so offensive to other people , because other people could benefit from the ideas , i think , that we 've laid down so that was , at the time , that was very popular , when we were starting , so that was one of the , one of the things that we still hate the most , is having to pay to be saved in some , like , ridiculous it was just , it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something , you know ? and then , when the records came out it just came everywhere , and so then everyone said 'what does that mean ? what does that mean ? ' whatever you want it to mean , you know '' brian baker , who joined the band later in their career , sums it up as follows : '' the name bad religion and the crossbuster logo came to pass in the minds of two fifteen-year-olds who were trying to find the most offensive name and image they could possibly find for the punk band they were starting in their garage ; studio albums how could hell be any worse ?
