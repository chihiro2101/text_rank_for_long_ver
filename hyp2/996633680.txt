although the original sideswiper is now rarely seen or used , nearly all advanced keys use some form of side-to-side action when the paddle is pressed to the right , it kicks a horizontal pendulum which then rocks against the contact points , sending a series of short pulses ( dits ) at a speed which is controlled by the position of the pendulum â€™ s weight '' keyers work with two different types of keys : single paddle and double paddle keys single paddle keys are also called single lever keys or sideswipers , the same name as the older side-to-side key design they greatly resemble single paddle keys are essentially the same as sideswiper keys with separate contacts on the left and right thumb using a keyer in what 's called '' iambic '' mode requires a key with two paddles : one paddle produces dits and the other produces dahs an additional advantage of electronic keyers over semiautomatic keys is that code speed is easily changed with electronic keyers , just by turning a knob with a dual paddle both contacts may be closed simultaneously , enabling the '' iambic '' functions of an electronic keyer that is designed to support them . for that reason , dual paddles are sometimes called squeeze keys when a single-paddle key is used with an electronic keyer , continuous dits are created by holding the dit side with a single-paddle or non-iambic keyer , the hand motion would require alternating four times for c ( dah-dit-dah-dit ) over the years iambic mode & nbsp ; b has become something of a standard and is the default setting in most keyers a third electronic keyer mode useful with a dual paddle is the '' ultimatic '' mode , named for the electronic keyer that introduced it typically , single and dual-paddle keys use horizontal movements , while a straight-key utilizes an up-and-down movement often , these were simple '' strap '' keys , in which a bend in the key lever provided the key 's spring action modern pigeon response keys are specially made switches but are still called '' keys '' due to their origins as telegraph keys with straight keys , side-swipers , and , to an extent , bugs , each and every telegraphist has their own unique style and pattern when transmitting a message however , electronic keyers ( single-paddle or iambic ) will produce '' perfect '' code at a set speed , thus only inter-character and inter-word spacing can produce a semblance of a fist .
