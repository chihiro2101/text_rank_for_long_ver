for sri aurobindo intuition comes under the realms of knowledge by identity ; he describes the psychological plane in humans ( often referred to as mana in sanskrit ) having two arbitrary natures , the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information ( mind seeking to become aware of external world ) he terms this second nature as knowledge by identity however , knowledge by identity , which we currently only give the awareness of human beings ' existence , can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge he finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans ( vedic ) and later was taken over by reason which currently organises our perception , thoughts and actions resulting from vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science he finds when self-awareness in the mind is applied to one 's self and the outer ( other ) -self , results in luminous self-manifesting identity ; the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge buddhism finds intuition to be a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge and puts the term intuition beyond the mental process of conscious thinking , as the conscious thought can not necessarily access subconscious information , or render such information into a communicable form in parts of zen buddhism intuition is deemed a mental state between the universal mind and one 's individual , discriminating mind in his book republic he tries to define intuition as a fundamental capacity of human reason to comprehend the true nature of reality he provides an example of mathematical truths , and posits that they are not arrived at by reason siháb al din-al suhrawadi , in his book philosophy of illumination ( ishraq ) , from following influences of plato he finds that intuition is knowledge acquired through illumination , is mystical in nature , and also suggests mystical contemplation ( mushahada ) to bring about correct judgment hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships ( relation of time , place , and causation ) while he states that '' the resemblance '' ( recognition of relations ) '' will strike the eye '' ( which would not require further examination ) but goes on to state , '' or rather in mind '' —attributing intuition to power of mind , contradicting the theory of empiricism immanuel kant ’ s notion of “ intuition ” differs considerably from the cartesian notion , and consists of the basic sensory information provided by the cognitive faculty of sensibility ( equivalent to what might loosely be called perception ) kant held that our mind casts all of our external intuitions in the form of space , and all of our internal intuitions ( memory , thought ) in the form of time a different challenge to appeals to intuition has recently come from experimental philosophy , who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science one of the main problems adduced by experimental philosophers is that intuitions differ , for instance , from one culture to another , and so it seems problematic to cite them as evidence for a philosophical claim according to sigmund freud , knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations and rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition , and his findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject in carl jung 's theory of the ego , described in 1916 in psychological types , intuition is an '' irrational function '' , opposed most directly by sensation , and opposed less strongly by the '' rational functions '' of thinking and feeling jung defined intuition as '' perception via the unconscious '' : using sense-perception only as a starting point , to bring forth ideas , images , possibilities , ways out of a blocked situation , by a process that is mostly unconscious in more-recent psychology , intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and decision making according to the works of daniel kahneman , intuition is the ability to automatically generate solutions without long logical arguments or evidence intuition , as a gut feeling based on experience , has been found to be useful for business leaders for making judgement about people , culture and strategy
