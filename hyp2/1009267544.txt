at the advent of laser cooling techniques , maxwell 's theory of electromagnetism had already led to the quantification of electromagnetic radiation exerting a force ( radiation pressure ) , however it was n't until the turn of the twentieth century when studies by lebedev ( 1901 ) , nichols ( 1901 ) , and hull ( 1903 ) experimentally demonstrated that force these early proposals for laser cooling only relied on '' scattering force '' , the name for the radiation pressure in later proposals , laser trapping , a variant of cooling which requires both scattering and a dipole force , would be introduced he emphasized how this process could allow for long spectroscopy measurements without the atoms escaping the trap and proposed the overlapping of optics traps in order to study interactions between different atoms the group wrote about experimentally demonstrating the cooling of atoms through a process using radiation pressure the process he used is now known as the zeeman slower and became one of the standard techniques for slowing an atomic beam the cooling processes were utilized to make atomic clocks more accurate and to improve spectroscopic measurements , and led to the observation of a new state of matter at ultracold temperatures doppler cooling , which is usually accompanied by a magnetic trapping force to give a magneto-optical trap , is by far the most common method of laser cooling , & nbsp ; at lower frequency ) of the transition , the atoms will absorb more photons if they move towards the light source , due to the doppler effect laser cooling has primarily been used on atoms , but recent progress has been made toward laser cooling more complex systems
