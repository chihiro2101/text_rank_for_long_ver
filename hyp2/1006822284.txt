russia soon became a maritime power and a force to be reckoned with in the baltic sea the main swedish naval base at karlskrona was too far to the south to meet sweden 's new needs for its navy in the 18th century , which often resulted in swedish ships reaching the coast of finland only after russian ships and troops had either started or completed their spring campaigns a russian naval campaign against the swedish coast towards the end of the great northern war further outlined the need to develop finnish coastal defenses immediately after the war ended the first plans were set in motion in sweden to construct an archipelago fleet and a base of operations for it in finland however , nothing with regard to sveaborg took place until the end of russo-swedish war ( 1741–1743 ) the following russo-swedish war ( 1741–1743 ) , which quickly turned from a swedish attack into a russian occupation of finland , again underlined the importance of developing fortifications in finland lack of base of operations for naval forces made it difficult for the swedish navy to operate in the area sweden started building the fortresses in january 1748 there were two main aspects to ehrensvärd 's design for sveaborg : a series of independent fortifications across several linked islands and , at the very heart of the complex , a navy dockyard in addition to the island fortress itself , seafacing fortifications on the mainland would ensure that an enemy could not acquire a beach-head from which to stage attacks on the sea fort construction started in early 1748 kept expanding , and by september there were around 2,500 men building the fortresses due to repeated russian threats in 1749 and 1750 , more effort was placed on the island fortifications at the expense of those on the mainland , so that a safe base of operations could be secured for the swedish naval units along the finnish coast using the military garrisoned in finland as the workforce , construction continued with over 6,000 workers in 1750 the substantial fortification work on the islands south of the town brought it a new and unexpected importance swedish participation to the seven years ' war halted the construction efforts in 1757 , which also marked the end of the rapid construction phase of sveaborg once again efforts slowed down as garrisons were reduced , and in 1776 sveaborg 's commander reported that he could n't even man one-tenth of the artillery placed in the fort even at the start of the russo-swedish war in 1788 sveaborg remained in an incomplete state the swedish fleet finally managed to set sail for its base at karlskrona on 20 november when the baltic sea had already frozen severely enough that ice had to be sawed open before some ships could move while the route to sweden was open again in late 1788 and in early 1789 , russian ships cut the connection from sveaborg to sweden by forming a blockade at porkkala cape sveaborg was the most important location for archipelago fleet 's ship construction and fitting during the war even so , and despite efforts , several ships remained unfinished at sveaborg until the end of the war the importance of sveaborg did not escape the russians whose broad operational plan for 1790 included a siege of sveaborg both from sea and land after taking over the fortress , the russians started an extensive building program , mostly extra barracks , and extended the dockyard and reinforced the fortification lines following the russian revolution in 1917 , the fortress became a possession of an independent finland finnish civil war prison camps the fortress was officially renamed suomenlinna ( castle of finland ) as part of the wave of nationalism
