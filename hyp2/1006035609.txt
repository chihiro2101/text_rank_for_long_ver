the ways in which the cells divide is specific to certain types of animals and may have many forms during gastrulation the blastula develops in one of two ways that divide the whole animal kingdom into two-halves ( see : embryological origins of the mouth and anus ) the studies that have been conducted have discovered many useful aspects of development that not only apply to fruit flies but other species as well pair-rule genes define 7 segments of the embryo within the confines of the second broad segment that was defined by the gap genes in regard to humans , the term embryo refers to the ball of dividing cells from the moment the zygote implants itself in the uterus wall until the end of the eighth week after conception similarly to karl ernst von baer 's principles that explained why many species often appear similar to one another in early developmental stages , darwin argued that the relationship between groups can be determined based upon common embryonic and larval structures the embryo of a given species never resembles the adult form of a lower one the embryo of a given species does resemble the embryonic form of a lower one using darwin 's theory evolutionary embryologists have since been able to distinguish between homologous and analogous structures between varying species only in the late 1950s when ultrasound was first used for uterine scanning , was the true developmental chronology of human fetus available part of this explanation explored why embryos in many species often appear similar to one another in early developmental stages using his four principles morphogens ) , its link to cell signalling , its roles in certain diseases and mutations , and its links to stem cell research for example , numerous invertebrate species release a larva before development is complete ; at the end of the larval period , an animal for the first time comes to resemble an adult similar to its parent or parents as variation in developmental progress makes comparison among species difficult , a character-based standard event system was developed , which documents these differences and allows for phylogenetic comparisons among species after the 1950s , with the dna helical structure being unraveled and the increasing knowledge in the field of molecular biology , developmental biology emerged as a field of study which attempts to correlate the genes with morphological change , and so tries to determine which genes are responsible for each morphological change that takes place in an embryo , and how these genes are regulated
