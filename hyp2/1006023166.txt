the latter is termed client-side authentication - sometimes used when authenticating using a smart card ( hosting a digital certificate and private key ) public key cryptography is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to secure communication on an insecure public network , and reliably verify the identity of an entity via digital signatures a public key infrastructure ( pki ) is a system for the creation , storage , and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity a pki consists of : a certificate authority ( ca ) that stores , issues and signs the digital certificates ; a registration authority ( ra ) which verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the ca ; a central directory—i.e , a secure location in which keys are stored and indexed ; a certificate management system managing things like the access to stored certificates or the delivery of the certificates to be issued ; a certificate policy stating the pki 's requirements concerning its procedures broadly speaking , there have traditionally been three approaches to getting this trust : certificate authority ( cas ) , web of trust ( wot ) , and simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) this is done using the ca 's own private key , so that trust in the user key relies on one 's trust in the validity of the ca 's key according to netcraft report from 2015 , the industry standard for monitoring active transport layer security ( tls ) certificates , states that '' although the global tls ecosystem is competitive , it is dominated by a handful of major cas — three certificate authorities ( symantec , sectigo , godaddy ) account for three-quarters of all issued tls certificates on public-facing web servers this approach involves a server that acts as an offline certificate authority within a single sign-on system a single sign-on server will issue digital certificates into the client system , but never stores them an alternative approach to the problem of public authentication of public key information is the web-of-trust scheme , which uses self-signed certificates and third-party attestations of those certificates because pgp and implementations allow the use of e-mail digital signatures for self-publication of public key information , it is relatively easy to implement one 's own web of trust a pki is only as valuable as the standards and practices that control the issuance of certificates and including pgp or a personally instituted web of trust could significantly degrade the trustworthiness of that enterprise 's or domain 's implementation of pki another alternative , which does not deal with public authentication of public key information , is the simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) that grew out of three independent efforts to overcome the complexities of x.509 and pgp 's web of trust this type of pki is specially useful for making integrations of pki that do not rely on third parties for certificate authorization , certificate information , etc since blockchain technology aims to provide a distributed and unalterable ledger of information , it has qualities considered highly suitable for the storage and management of public keys a certificate authority paradigm has these issues regardless of the underlying cryptographic methods and algorithms employed , and pki that seeks to endow certificates with trustworthy properties must also address these issues a pki structure was thus created for web users/sites wishing secure communications pki has had the most success in government implementations ; the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency ( disa ) pki infrastructure for the common access cards program , secret key—methods ; mobile signatures are electronic signatures that are created using a mobile device and rely on signature or certification services in a location independent telecommunication environment ; mark gasson , martin meints , kevin warwick ( 2005 ) , d3.2 : a study on pki and biometrics , fidis deliverable ( 3 ) 2 , july 2005 internet of things requires secure communication between mutually trusted devices a public key infrastructure enables devices to obtain and renew x509 certificates which are used to establish trust between devices and encrypt communications using tls http/2 , the latest version of http protocol , allows unsecured connections in theory ; in practice , major browser companies have made it clear that they would support this protocol only over a pki secured tls connection this means browsers need to carry a large number of different certificate providers , increasing the risk of a key compromise
