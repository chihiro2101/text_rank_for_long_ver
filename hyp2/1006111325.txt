boston 's business leaders , many of them harvard alumni , were pressing for change — though with no clear idea of the kinds of changes they wanted on his return to the united states in 1865 , eliot

founder of eastman kodak company in 1916 , mit succeeded in moving across the charles river from crowded back bay , boston to larger facilities on the southern riverfront of cambridge , but still faced the prospect of merger with harvard , maclaurin quoted : '' in future harvard agrees to carry out all its work in engineering and mining in the buildings of technology under the executive control of the president of technology , and , what is of the first importance , to commit all instruction and the laying down of all courses to the faculty of technology , after that faculty has been enlarged and strengthened by the addition to its existing members of men of eminence from harvard 's graduate school of applied science they had four sons , one of whom , charles eliot ( november 1 , 1859 – march 25 , 1897 ) became an important landscape architect , responsible for boston 's public park system eliot was a cousin and attended harvard from 1906 through 1909 , completing his elective

entrance examinations and hiring well-known scholars from home and abroad eliot 's leadership made harvard not only the pace-setter for other american schools , but a major figure in the reform of secondary school education both the elite boarding schools , most of them founded during his presidency , and the public high schools shaped their curricula to meet harvard 's demanding standards as leader of the nation 's wealthiest and best-known university , eliot was necessarily a celebrated figure whose opinions were sought on a wide variety of matters , from tax policy ( he offered the first coherent rationale for the charitable tax exemption ) to the intellectual welfare of the general public president eliot edited the harvard classics , which together are colloquially known as his five foot shelf five foot shelf and which were intended at the time to suggest a foundation for informed discourse , '' a good substitute for a liberal education in youth to anyone who would read them
