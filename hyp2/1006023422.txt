during the first half of the 20th century , photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of agn emission , although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the agn phenomenon schmidt noted that if this object was extragalactic ( outside the milky way , at a cosmological distance ) then its large redshift of 0.158 implied that it was the nuclear region of a galaxy about 100 times more powerful than other radio galaxies that had been identified shortly afterward , optical spectra were used to measure the redshifts of a growing number of quasars including 3c 48 , even more distant at redshift 0.37 the enormous luminosities of these quasars as well as their unusual spectral properties indicated that their power source could not be ordinary stars thus agn-like characteristics are expected whenever a supply of material for accretion comes within the sphere of influence of the central black hole the jet production mechanism and indeed the jet composition on very small scales are not understood at present due to the resolution of astronomical instruments being too low radiatively inefficient accretion has been used to explain the lack of strong agn-type radiation from massive black holes at the centres of elliptical galaxies in clusters , where otherwise we might expect high accretion rates and correspondingly high luminosities as the name suggests , these systems show only weak nuclear emission-line regions , and no other signatures of agn emission originally they were divided into two types known as seyfert 1 and 2 : seyfert 1s show strong broad emission lines while seyfert 2s do not , and seyfert 1s are more likely to show strong low-energy x-ray emission thus they show strong optical continuum emission , broad and narrow emission lines , and strong x-ray emission , together with nuclear and often extended radio emission in the latter case , emission lines may become visible when the variable component is at a low level ovv quasars behave more like standard radio-loud quasars with the addition of a rapidly variable component in both classes of source , the variable emission is believed to originate in a relativistic jet oriented close to the line of sight low-excitation objects show no strong narrow or broad emission lines , and the emission lines they do have may be excited by a different mechanism the small class of broad-line radio galaxies , which show relatively strong nuclear optical continuum emission probably includes some objects that are simply low-luminosity radio-loud quasars unified models propose that different observational classes of agn are a single type of physical object observed under different conditions in seyfert 2s the nucleus is observed through an obscuring structure which prevents a direct view of the optical continuum , broad-line region or ( soft ) x-ray emission the key insight of orientation-dependent accretion models is that the two types of object can be the same if only certain angles to the line of sight are observed outside the torus there is material that can scatter some of the nuclear emission into our line of sight , allowing us to see some optical and x-ray continuum and , in some cases , broad emission lines—which are strongly polarized , showing that they have been scattered and proving that some seyfert 2s really do contain hidden seyfert 1s if they do not have the scattering component of seyfert 2s they would be hard to detect except through their luminous narrow-line and hard x-ray emission these can be unified with narrow-line radio galaxies in a manner directly analogous to the seyfert 1/2 unification ( but without the complication of much in the way of a reflection component : narrow-line radio galaxies show no nuclear optical continuum or reflected x-ray component , although they do occasionally show polarized broad-line emission ) x-ray evidence , where available , supports the unified picture : radio galaxies show evidence of obscuration from a torus , while quasars do not , although care must be taken since radio-loud objects also have a soft unabsorbed jet-related component , and high resolution is necessary to separate out thermal emission from the sources ' large-scale hot-gas environment these do not show strong nuclear emission lines—broad or narrow—they have optical continua which appear to be entirely jet-related , and their x-ray emission is also consistent with coming purely from a jet , with no heavily absorbed nuclear component in general these objects can not be unified with quasars , even though they include some high-luminosity objects when looking at radio emission , since the torus can never hide the narrow-line region to the required extent , and since infrared studies show that they have no hidden nuclear component : in fact there is no evidence for a torus in these objects at all therefore , one can not know whether the gas in all seyfert 2 galaxies is ionized due to photoionization from a single , non-stellar continuum source in the center or due to shock-ionization from e.g the two classes of populations appear to differ by their luminosity , where the seyfert 2s without a hidden broad-line region are generally less luminous the models also suggest an accretion-rate dependence of the broad-line region and provide a natural evolution from more active engines in seyfert 1s to more “ dead ” seyfert 2s and can explain the observed break-down of the unified model at low luminosities and the evolution of the broad-line region today , having overcome the previous limitations of small sample sizes and anisotropic selection , studies of neighbours of hundreds to thousands of agn have shown that the neighbours of seyfert 2s are intrinsically dustier and more star-forming than seyfert 1s and a connection between agn type , host galaxy morphology and collision history understanding whether it is the same engine driving all seyfert 2s , the connection to radio-loud agn , the mechanisms of the variability of some agn that vary between the two types at very short time scales , and the connection of the agn type to small- and large-scale environment remain important issues to incorporate into any unified model of active galactic nuclei for a long time , active galaxies held all the records for the highest-redshift objects known either in the optical or the radio spectrum , because of their high luminosity this suggests that massive black holes formed early on and that the conditions for the formation of luminous agn were more common in the early universe , such as a much higher availability of cold gas near the centre of galaxies than at present the evolution of the low-luminosity agn population is much less well understood due to the difficulty of observing these objects at high redshifts
