that year , while driving from utah to wisconsin to start a job with tsr , hickman and his wife created the dragonlance universe concept during the trip , hickman and his wife discussed two ideas they had had for several years : an entire world used to support a storyline , and a world dominated by dragons their ideas were well received by tsr , whose marketing department felt they had enough dungeons , but not enough dragons the dragonlance group decided that novels should accompany the game modules ; tsr reluctantly agreed and hired a writer hickman became the design coordinator for project overlord , the cover name for what would later be known as the dragonlance saga tsr decided to create a franchise , including modules , board games , lead figures , and & mdash ; for the first time & mdash ; novels they collaborated over a weekend , writing the prologue for the first five chapters of the first novel , dragons of autumn twilight , based on the module dragons of despair they returned to write dragons of summer flame for tsr in 1995 , thinking it would be their final dragonlance novel at the time , dragonlance gaming had been converted to the saga system , with limited success , and that , combined with tsr 's general financial troubles , put the setting 's future in doubt all three novels made the new york times bestseller list , and the setting was commercially revitalized the central books of the dragonlance series were written by the authoring team of weis and hickman ; however , many other writers have made contributions , including richard a boing boing reported that '' according to the lawsuit , weis and hickman agreed with wizards of the coast to produce the new novels in 2017 , capping off the series and giving fans a final sendoff weis and hickman 's publishing agent affirmed a few weeks following this that a new trilogy of dragonlance novels is in the works with plans for publication in 2021 the main storyline of the original dragonlance series has been written by margaret weis and tracy hickman , with multiple books written by other authors , covering years between and sometimes during the main events the books feature time travel , and focus on events in istar before the cataclysm , as well as the ensuing dwarfgate wars the second generation is a single compilation book which picks the most important tales from the tales series and details the children of the companions , all of whom become players in the later story this book is considered to be part of the main storyline , as it must be read to understand the events that happened between the war of the lance and the chaos war this novel develops characters that would later be seen in the war of souls trilogy dragons of a new age describes the rise of the dragon overlords and introduces the fifth age of dragonlance however , in 1996 , dragonlance was converted to use the new saga system , which uses cards to determine the effects of actions , with the publication of the dragonlance : fifth age roleplaying game more recently , devil 's due publishing and wizards of the coast have also produced a number of comic book series : the legend of huma ( 2003 ) , chronicles ( 2005 ) and legends ( 2008 ) the age of dreams , the second age , is marked by the rapid growth of the world 's first great civilizations and the appearance of myriad new races this era is also marked by three great wars between dragons and their minions when dragonlance was first introduced to dungeons & dragons , events such as the lost wars happened during the age of despair '' in a '' traveling road show '' put on to publicize the novels , the heroes of the lance were played by various people according to hickman , lord soth is the most unpredictable character to write about , saying '' every time that character made an appearance in one of our books he would try to run off with the story like in many dungeons & dragons campaign settings , the fictional world of the dragonlance campaign is shaped by the division by race , with white humans as central focus , but also including elves , goblins and many others dragonlance is one of the most popular shared worlds , worlds in which writers other than those that created them place adventures according to the 1990s by marc oxoby , what is most notable about the series is that '' what may at one time been considered disposable , escapist literature '' found '' unprecedented popularity '' in the 1990s hunt feels that it is unusual for authors to receive such loathing among '' fantasy 's literary mafia '' , saying , '' behind every critic 's scorn laden insult , there that unsaid thought at the end : 'but i could have written that !
