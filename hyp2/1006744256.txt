on cars and trucks , several senses of the word axle occur in casual usage , referring to the shaft itself , its housing , or simply any transverse pair of wheels in a live-axle suspension system , the axles serve to transmit driving torque to the wheel , as well as to maintain the position of the wheels relative to each other and to the vehicle body the axles in this system must also bear the weight of the vehicle plus any cargo conversely , many front-wheel drive cars have a solid rear beam axle like a full floating axle system , the drive shafts in a front-wheel drive independent suspension system do not support any vehicle weight even when the suspension is not independent , split axles permit the use of a differential , allowing the left and right drive wheels to be driven at different speeds as the automobile turns , improving traction and extending tire life truck designs use such a configuration to provide a greater weight capacity than a single axle modern front-wheel drive cars typically combine the transmission ( gearbox and differential ) and front axle into a single unit called a transaxle the drive axle may be a live axle , but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential some simple vehicle designs , such as leisure go-karts , may have a single driven wheel where the drive axle is a split axle with only one of the two shafts driven by the engine , or else have both wheels connected to one shaft without a differential ( kart racing ) however , other go-karts have two rear drive wheels too a dead axle , also called a lazy axle , is not part of the drivetrain , but is instead free-rotating several manufacturers offer computer-controlled airlift , so that the dead axles are automatically lowered when the main axle reaches its weight limit this setup allows the axle shaft to be the means of propulsion , and also support the weight of the vehicle the main difference between the full- and semi-floating axle setups is the number of bearings to remove the semi-floating axle , one has to remove a wheel first ; if such axle breaks , the wheel is most likely to come off the vehicle
