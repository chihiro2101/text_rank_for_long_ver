at the end of the 11th & nbsp ; century , the modern township of pontefract consisted of two distinct and separate localities known as tanshelf and kirkby eric houlder , ancient roots north : when pontefract stood on the great north road , ( pontefract : pontefract groups together , 2012 ) p.7 the 11th-century historian , orderic vitalis , recorded that , in 1069 , william the conqueror travelled across yorkshire to put down an uprising which had sacked york , but that , upon his journey to the city , he discovered that the crossing of the river aire at what is modern-day pontefract had been blockaded by a group of local anglo-scandinavian insurgents , who had broken the bridge and held the opposite bank in force such a crossing point would have been important in the town 's early days , providing access between pontefract and other settlements to the north and east , such as york the modern town is situated on an old roman road ( now the a639 ) , described as the '' roman ridge '' , which passes south towards doncaster the roman ridge is believed to form part of an alternative route from doncaster to york via castleford and tadcaster , as a diversion of the major roman road ermine street , which may have been used to avoid having to cross the humber near north ferriby during rough weather conditions over the humber and even today , the major streets in pontefract are designated by the danish word 'gate ' e.g the area which is now the town market place was the original meeting place of the osgoldcross wapentake hey in the anglo-saxon period a part of the modern township of pontefract was known by the anglo-scandinavian name of kirkby after the norman conquest in 1066 almost all of yorkshire came under the ownership of followers of william the conqueror , fletcher 16–17 one of whom was de lacy who became the owner of tateshale ( tanshelf ) where he began to build a castle the town of pontefract and the village of wentbridge are of central importance to the legend of robin hood , as it was told in the middle ages 15-16 ) the late , great historians richard barrie dobson and john taylor indicated that this location provides a very specific clue to robin hood 's pontefract heritage , noting that such evidence of continuity makes it virtually certain that the saylis or sayles , which was so well known to the robin hood of the '' gest '' survived into modern times as the 'sayles plantation ' near wentbridge and john taylor , rymes of robyn hode : an introduction to the english outlaw , 3rd edition ( stroud : sutton publishing , 1997 ) p.22 to commemorate this , english heritage has sited a blue plaque on the bridge that stands in the heart of the village , above the river went , lending weight to pontefract 's claims to be the true home of robin hood english heritage blue plaque , awarded to wentbridge , pontefract ( photo to follow soon ) wentbridge is a small village in the city of wakefield district of west yorkshire , england close by to the southwest is the roman ridge , a roman road , known in the middle ages as watling street , closely follows the course of the modern-day a639 it was at one time , prior to modern construction works being completed , possible to look down from the saylis upon watling street as it snaked through the village of wentbridge and it is upon this stretch of highway that robin hood and his merry men are believed to have committed their famous heists eric houlder , ancient roots north : when pontefract stood on the great north road , ( pontefract : pontefract groups together , 2012 ) p.7 the earliest-known robin hood place-name reference - in yorkshire or anywhere else - occurs in a deed of 1322 from the two cartularies of monk bretton priory , near the town of barnsley cheney and michael jones : a handbook of dates for students of british history ( london : royal historical society 1945/new edition : cambridge university press 2000 , reprinted 2004 ) pp196-199 walker this was on the eastern side of the great north road , a mile south of barnsdale bar on the opposite side of the road once stood robin hood 's well , which has since been relocated six miles north-west of doncaster , on the south-bound side of the great north road 22 further evidence of robin hood 's wakefield connections comes by way of michael drayton 's poly-olbion song 28 ( 67–70 ) , composed in 1622 la ' chance published a thesis that detailed how a notorious medieval outlaw named swein-son-of-sicga , and styled by contemporaries as 'the prince of thieves ' inhabited the forested areas of barnsdale , on the outskirts of pontefract , and made a living by robbing , amongst others abbot benedict of selby green indicates that hugh fitz baldric , the late eleventh century sheriff of nottingham and yorkshire , held responsibility for bringing swein-son-of-sicga to justice 24 ( london : hmso , 1990 ) , pp.67 & 89 acknowledging this , la ' chance suggested that the robin hood legend is loosely based upon the deeds of swein-son-of-sicga la ' chance closed his thesis by suggesting that , in all likelihood , the outlaw drew his final breath at saint nicholas 's hospital ,
