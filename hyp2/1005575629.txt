the setting of a fantasy work is often of great importance to the plot and characters of the story for example , oz , though a fantasy world in every way , is described as part of this world this is a process that continues , and finally culminates in the fantasy world having little connection , if any , to actual times and places dream frames were also once common for encasing the fantasy world with an explanation of its marvels colin manlove , christian fantasy : from 1200 to the present p 210 this has also altered the nature of the plots ; earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance , and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures , and later works more often feature characters in a social web , where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril the most common fantasy world is one based on medieval europe , and has been since william morris used it in his early fantasy works , such as the well at the world 's end such a world is often called '' pseudo-medieval '' —particularly when the writer has snatched up random elements from the era , which covered a thousand years and a continent , and thrown them together without consideration for their compatibility , or even introduced ideas not so much based on the medieval era as on medievalism of it alec austin , '' quality in epic fantasy '' fantasy worlds also tend to be medieval in economy , and disproportionately pastoral 113 , heavy and faithful use of real-world setting for inspiration , as in barry hughart 's bridge of birds , clearly derived from china , or lloyd alexander 's use of real world cultures such as welsh for the chronicles of prydain or indian for the iron ring , make the line between fantasy worlds and alternate histories fuzzy conversely , the creation by an author of an imaginary country—such as ruritania or graustark—does not automatically transform that imaginary country into a fantasy world , even if the location would be impossible in reality owing to a lack of land to contain it ; but such ruritanian romances may be pushed toward the category of fantasy worlds by the introduction of figures such as witches and wise women , where it is not clear if their magic is effectual 6 according to lin carter in imaginary worlds : the art of fantasy , fantasy worlds , by their nature , contain some element of magic ( paranormal ) lewis was a colleague of tolkien , and their fictional worlds share several key elements fairytale fantasy may ignore the normal world-building in order to present a world operating by the same logic as the fairytales from which they are derived , though other works in this subgenre develop their worlds fully rather than creating their own fantasy world , many authors choose to set their novels in earth 's past in order to explain the absence of miraculous elements , authors may introduce '' a retreat of magic '' ( sometimes called '' thinning '' ) that explains why the magic and other fantastic elements no longer appear : john grant and john clute , the encyclopedia of fantasy , '' thinning '' , p a contemporary fantasy necessarily takes place in what purports to be the real world , and not a fantasy world many established fantasy writers have also derided dungeons and dragons and the fantasy fiction it has inspired due to its influencing new writers toward reading the dungeons & dragons monster manual instead of studying the original literature and mythology from which modern fantasy literature has sprung due to the fuzzy boundary between fantasy and science fiction , it is similarly difficult to make a hard-and-fast distinction between '' fantasy worlds '' and planets in science fiction
