a rebellion occurred in china in the last years of the 9th century , making the political situation unstable therefore , the heian period is considered a high point in japanese culture that later generations have always admired the period is also noted for the rise of the samurai class , which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of japan the warrior class made steady political gains throughout the heian period still , a true military takeover of the japanese government was centuries away , when much of the strength of the government would lie within the private armies of the shogunate known as the ritsuryō code , this system attempted to recreate the tang legal system in japan , despite the '' tremendous differences in the levels of development between the two countries '' kanmu 's avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles , and he became recognized as one of japan 's most forceful emperors imperial control over the provinces was tenuous at best , however in the ninth and tenth centuries , much authority was lost to the great families , who disregarded the chinese-style land and tax systems imposed by the government in kyoto stability came to japan , but , even though succession was ensured for the imperial family through heredity , power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family , the fujiwara which also helped japan develop more following kanmu 's death in 806 and a succession struggle among his sons , two new offices were established in an effort to adjust the taika–taihō administrative structure through the new emperor 's private office , the emperor could issue administrative edicts more directly and with more self-assurance than before while these two offices strengthened the emperor 's position temporarily , soon they and other chinese-style structures were bypassed in the developing state in 838 the end of the imperial-sanctioned missions to tang china , which had begun in 630 , marked the effective end of chinese influence as the soga clan had taken control of the throne in the sixth century , the fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family , and one of their members was the first head of the emperor 's private office toward the end of the 9th century , several emperors tried but failed , to check the fujiwara central control of japan had continued to decline , and the fujiwara , along with other great families and religious foundations , acquired ever larger shōen and greater wealth during the early tenth century little authority was left for traditional institutions , and government affairs were handled through the fujiwara clan 's private administration hiragana gave written expression to the spoken word and , with it , to the rise in japan 's famous vernacular literature , much of it written by court women who had not been trained in chinese as had their male counterparts whereas the first phase of shōen development in the early heian period had seen the opening of new lands and the granting of the use of lands to aristocrats and religious institutions , the second phase saw the growth of patrimonial '' house governments '' , as in the old clan system in fact , the form of the old clan system had remained largely intact within the great old centralized government as the most powerful family , the fujiwara governed japan and determined the general affairs of state , such as succession to the throne family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed , a pattern followed among other families , monasteries , and even the imperial family land management became the primary occupation of the aristocracy , not so much because direct control by the imperial family or central government had declined but more from strong family solidarity and a lack of a sense of japan as a single nation at that time the imperial court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional warriors composed mainly of oryoshi , which were appointed to an individual province and tsuibushi , which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks shōen holders had access to manpower and , as they obtained improved military technology ( such as new training methods , more powerful bows , armor , horses , and superior swords ) and faced worsening local conditions in the ninth century , military service became part of shōen life members of the fujiwara , taira , and minamoto families—all of whom had descended from the imperial family—attacked one another , claimed control over vast tracts of conquered land , set up rival regimes , and generally upset the peace rather than being banished , the fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making in time , many of the fujiwara were replaced , mostly by members of the rising minamoto clan while the fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions , the insei system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne a struggle for succession in the mid-twelfth century gave the fujiwara an opportunity to regain their former power in the end , the fujiwara were destroyed , the old system of government supplanted , and the insei system left powerless as bushi took control of court affairs , marking a turning point in japanese history taira no kiyomori emerged as the real power in japan following the fujiwara 's destruction , and he would remain in command for the next 20 years with yoritomo firmly established , the bakufu system that governed japan for the next seven centuries was in place although written chinese ( kanbun ) remained the official language of the heian period imperial court , the introduction and widespread use of kana saw a boom in japanese literature a well-written poem could easily make or break one 's reputation , and often was a key part of social interaction during the heian period , beauty was widely considered an important part of what made one a '' good '' person while on one hand , the heian period was an unusually long period of peace , it can also be argued that the period weakened japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants one reason the samurai were able to take power was that the ruling nobility proved incompetent at managing japan and its provinces
