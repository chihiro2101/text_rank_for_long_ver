the common apple rot fungus p & nbsp ; expansum was later selected as the type species the genus name is derived from the latin root penicillum , meaning '' painter 's brush '' , and refers to the chains of conidia that resemble a broom species of penicillium are ubiquitous soil fungi preferring cool and moderate climates , commonly present wherever organic material is available commonly known in america as molds , they are among the main causes of food spoilage , especially species of subgenus penicillium some species have a blue color , commonly growing on old bread and giving it a blue fuzzy texture some penicillium species affect the fruits and bulbs of plants , including p some species are known to be pathogenic to animals ; p some penicillium species cause damage to machinery and the combustible materials and lubricants used to run and maintain them several species of the genus penicillium play a central role in the production of cheese and of various meat products some penicillium species have shown potential for use in bioremediation , more specifically mycoremediation , because of their ability to break down a variety of xenobiotic compounds the genus includes a wide variety of species molds that are the source molds of major antibiotics additional species that produce compounds capable of inhibiting the growth of tumor cells in vitro include : p however recent studies have revealed that sex occurs even in some of the supposedly asexual species for example , sexual capability was recently shown for the fungus penicillium roqueforti , used as a starter for blue cheese production these findings with penicillium species are consistent with accumulating evidence from studies of other eukaryote species that sex was likely present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes prior to 2013 , when the '' one fungus , one name '' nomenclature change came into effect , penicillium was used as the genus for anamorph ( clonal forms ) of fungi and talaromyces was used for the teleomorph ( sexual forms ) of fungi
