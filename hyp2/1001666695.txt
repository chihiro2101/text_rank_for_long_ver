over time , dial-up links were replaced by internet connections , and uucp added a number of new link layer protocols these newer connections also reduced the need for uucp at all , as newer application protocols developed to take advantage of the new networks uucp is normally started by having a user log into the target system and then running the uucp program in most cases , this is automated by logging into a known user account used for transfers , whose account 's shell has been set to thus , for automated transfers , another machine simply has to open a modem connection to the called machine and log into the known account depending on the setup of the two systems , the call may end here there are four types : : s causes a file to be sent from the caller to the called system ( upload ) this can be used to make that system call another and deliver files to it the protocol originated as a general-purpose system for packet delivery , and thus offers a number of features that are not used by the uucp package as a whole these include a secondary channel that can send command data interspersed with a file transfer , and the ability to renegotiate the packet and window sizes during transmission in theory , a system using 4k packets and 7 packet windows ( 4096x7 ) would offer performance matching or beating the best file-transfer protocols like zmodem taylor uucp did not support g , but did support any valid requested window or packet size , so remote systems starting g would work fine with taylor 's g , while two taylor systems could negotiate even faster connections telebit modems used protocol spoofing to improve the performance of g-protocol transfers by noticing end-of-packet markers being sent to the remote system and immediately sending an back to the local host , pretending that the remote system had already received the packet and decoded it correctly the data between the two modems was error-corrected using a proprietary protocol based on mnp that ran over telebit 's half-duplex connections much better than g-protocol would normally , because in the common 64x3 case the remote system would be sending a constant stream of s that would overflow the low-speed return channel this was originally intended for use on x.25 links , which were popular for a time in the 1980s the and capabilities could be used to send email between machines , with suitable mail user interfaces and delivery agent programs for example , the address barbox ! user would refer to user user on adjacent machine barbox for example , if machine barbox is not connected to the local machine , but it is known that barbox is connected to machine foovax which does communicate with the local machine , the appropriate address to send mail to would be foovax ! barbox ! user many users would suggest multiple routes from various large well-known sites , providing even better and perhaps faster connection service from the mail sender in general , like other non-internet email address , bang paths have now been superseded by the '' notation '' , even by sites still using uucp the uucp network was constantly changing as new systems and dial-up links were added , others were removed , etc each system administrator would submit , by e-mail , a list of the systems to which theirs would connect , along with a ranking for each such connection these submitted map entries were processed by an automatic program that combined them into a single set of files describing all connections in the network the uucp map files could then be used by software such as '' pathalias '' to compute the best route path from one machine to another for mail , and to supply this route automatically a user at a system with uucp connections could thereby exchange mail with internet users , and the internet links could be used to bypass large portions of the slow uucp network this was at a time when true internet access required a leased line providing a connection to an internet point of presence , both of which were expensive and difficult to arrange by contrast , a link to the uucp network could usually be established with a few phone calls to the administrators of prospective neighbor systems the command is run by the daemon , which handles remote execution requests as simply another kind of file to batch-send to the remote system whenever a next-hop node is available the remote system will then execute the requested command and return the result , when the original system is available one surviving feature of uucp is the chat file format , largely inherited by the expect software package in the mid 2000s , uucp over tcp/ip ( often encrypted , using the ssh protocol ) was proposed for use when a computer does not have any fixed ip addresses but is still willing to run a standard mail transfer agent ( mta ) like sendmail or postfix bang-like paths are still in use within the usenet network , though not for routing ; they are used to record , in the header of a message , the nodes through which that message has passed , rather than to direct where it will go next
