discovered that klaus fuchs , a german refugee theoretical physicist working for the british mission in the manhattan project , had given key documents to the soviets throughout the war fuchs identified his courier as american harry gold , who was arrested on may 23 , 1950 on june 15 , 1950 , david greenglass was arrested by the fbi for espionage and soon confessed to having passed secret information on to the ussr through gold he also claimed that his sister ethel 's husband julius rosenberg had convinced david 's wife ruth to recruit him while visiting him in albuquerque , new mexico , in 1944 on august 11 , 1950 , ethel rosenberg was arrested after testifying before a grand jury ( see section , below ) twenty senior government officials met secretly on february 8 , 1950 , to discuss the rosenberg case gordon dean , the chairman of the atomic energy commission , said : '' it looks as though rosenberg is the kingpin of a very large ring , and if there is any way of breaking him by having the shadow of a death penalty over him , we want to do it '' myles lane , a member of the prosecution team , said that the case against ethel rosenberg was '' not too strong '' , but that it was '' very important that she be convicted too , and given a stiff sentence '' sol stern and ronald radosh , the new republic ( june 23 , 1979 ) their case against ethel rosenberg was resolved 10 days before the start of the trial , when david and ruth greenglass were interviewed a second time david originally had said that he 'd passed the atomic data he 'd collected to julius on a new york street corner after being interviewed this second time , he said that he had given this information to julius in the living room of the rosenbergs ' new york apartment '' in her re-interview , ruth greenglass expanded on her husband 's version : '' julius then took the info into the bathroom and read it and when he came out he called ethel and told her she had to type this information immediately '' as a result of this new testimony , all charges against ruth greenglass were dropped her attorney asked the us commissioner to parole her in his custody over the weekend , so that she could make arrangements for her two young children he also testified that his sister ethel rosenberg typed notes containing us nuclear secrets in the rosenberg apartment in september 1945 which provides that anyone convicted of transmitting or attempting to transmit to a foreign government '' information relating to the national defense '' may be imprisoned for life or put to death prosecutor roy cohn later claimed that his influence led to both kaufman and saypol being appointed to the rosenberg case , and that kaufman imposed the death penalty based on cohn 's personal recommendation 278 in imposing the death penalty , kaufman noted that he held the rosenbergs responsible not only for espionage but also for american deaths in the korean war : julius rosenberg claimed the case was a political frame-up after the publication of an investigative series in the national guardian and the formation of the national committee to secure justice in the rosenberg case , some americans came to believe both rosenbergs were innocent or had received too harsh a sentence , particularly ethel that stay resulted from intervention in the case by fyke farmer , a tennessee lawyer whose efforts had previously been scorned by the rosenbergs ' attorney , emanuel hirsch bloch rhoda laks , another attorney on the rosenbergs ' defense team , also made this argument before judge kaufman ethel was the last female convict to be electrocuted in the state of new york and also the first of the only two women executed by the federal government in the 20th century , the other one being bonnie heady , also executed in 1953 senator daniel patrick moynihan , vice-chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence , investigated how much the soviet spy ring helped the ussr to build their bomb '' thanks to information provided by their agents , '' moynihan wrote in his book secrecy , '' they did it in four nikita khrushchev , leader of the soviet union from 1953 to 1964 , said in his posthumously published memoir that he '' can not specifically say what kind of help the rosenbergs provided us '' but that he learned from joseph stalin and vyacheslav molotov that they '' had provided very significant help in accelerating the production of our atomic bomb in 1995 , the us government made public many documents decoded by the venona project , showing julius rosenberg 's role as part of a productive ring of spies for example , a 1944 cable ( which gives the name of ruth greenglass in clear text ) says that ruth 's brother david is being recruited as a spy by his sister ( that is , ethel rosenberg ) and her husband the cable also makes clear that the sister 's husband is involved enough in espionage to have his own code name ( '' liberal '' ) '' he said he gave false testimony to protect himself and his wife , ruth , and that he was encouraged by the prosecution to do so in september 2008 , the national archives released most of the grand jury testimony related to prosecution of the rosenbergs , as a result of a suit by the national security archive at george washington university , historians and journalists at the grand jury , she was asked , '' did n't you write the information down on a piece of paper ? '' she replied , '' yes , i wrote the information down on a piece of paper and julius rosenberg took it with him rogers , who had been part of the prosecution of the rosenbergs , discussed their strategy at the time in relation to seeking the death sentence for ethel he said they had urged the death sentence for ethel in an effort to extract a full confession from julius he reportedly said , '' she called our bluff , '' as she made no effort to push her husband to any action '' he said that he thought the hand-drawn diagrams and other atomic-bomb details that were acquired by david greenglass and passed to julius were of '' little value '' to the soviet union , and were used only to corroborate what they had already learned from the other atomic spies he also said that he believed ethel rosenberg was aware of her husband 's deeds , but took no part in them in a subsequent letter to the new york times , sobell denied that he knew anything about julius rosenberg 's alleged atomic espionage activities , and that the only thing he knew for sure was what he himself did in association with julius rosenberg in 2009 , extensive notes collected from kgb archives were made public in a book published by yale university press : spies : the rise and fall of the kgb in america , written by john earl haynes , harvey klehr , and alexander vassiliev ; vassiliev 's notebooks included kgb comments concerning julius and ethel rosenberg landis , 2010 ) the notebooks make clear that the kgb considered julius rosenberg an effective agent and his wife ethel an enthusiastic supporter of his work the rosenbergs ' two sons , michael and robert , spent years trying to prove the innocence of their parents after morton sobell 's 2008 confession , they acknowledged their father had been involved in espionage , but said that whatever atomic bomb information he passed to the russians was , at best , superfluous ; the case was riddled with prosecutorial and judicial misconduct ; their mother was convicted on flimsy evidence to place leverage on her husband ; and neither deserved the death penalty robert wrote a later memoir , an execution in the family : one son 's journey ( 2003 ) their sons ' current position is that julius was legally guilty of the conspiracy charge , though not of atomic spying , while ethel was only generally aware of his activities in 2015 , following the most recent grand jury transcript release , michael and robert meeropol called on us president barack obama ’ s administration to acknowledge that ethel rosenberg 's conviction and execution was wrongful , and to issue a proclamation exonerating her similarly , on september 28 , 2015 , the 100th & nbsp ; anniversary of ethel 's birth , eleven members of the new york city council issued a proclamation stating that '' the government wrongfully executed ethel rosenberg , '' and manhattan borough president gale brewer officially recognized , '' the injustice suffered by ethel rosenberg and her family , '' and declared it , '' ethel rosenberg day of justice in the borough of manhattan '' in march & nbsp ; 2016 , michael and robert ( via the rosenberg fund for children ) launched a petition campaign calling on president obama and u.s in october & nbsp ; 2016 , the cbs news show 60 minutes presented the story of the rosenbergs ' children and their quest for their mother 's exoneration ; however , no us administration has taken action this sparked a long delay in the publication of the novel , since publishing houses feared a lawsuit from nixon framing history : the rosenberg story and the cold war , ( university of minnesota press , 1993 ) meeropol , michael , '' ' a spy who turned his family in ' : revisiting david greenglass and the rosenberg case , '' american communist history ( may 2018 ) available at meeropol , michael , ed the brother : the untold story of the rosenberg case , random house , 2003 , sam roberts , the brother : the untold story of atomic spy david greenglass and how he sent his sister , ethel rosenberg , to the electric chair , random house , 2001 a statement by the rosenberg 's sons in support of their exoneration an interview with robert meeropol about the adoption national committee to reopen the rosenberg case annotated bibliography for ethel rosenberg from the alsos digital library for nuclear issues annotated bibliography for julius rosenberg from the alsos digital library for nuclear issues the cold war international history project ( cwihp ) for alexander vassiliev 's notebooks rosenberg son : '' my parents were executed under the unconstitutional espionage act '' —video report by democracy now ! history on trial : the rosenberg case in e.l
