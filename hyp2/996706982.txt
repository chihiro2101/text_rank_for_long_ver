most of the world 's iron ore , including that contained in northern minnesota , was formed during the middle precambrian over billions of years , geological forces left behind ore deposits of varied quality and concentrations – differences that would determine how the ore was mined from place to place on the mesabi range , stretching from grand rapids to babbitt , soft ore lay close to the surface , where it could be scooped from open pit mines the highest point , at , is roughly west of the unincorporated community of hinsdale , near the former erie mining company 's pits and taconite processing plant initially underground mines were employed but these gave way to open pits so that by 1902 , half the operations were conducted this way iron ore is currently mined only from open pits , although some mines operated underground early on iron range – the mining frontier much of the softer ore was formed close to the surface , allowing mining operations to be conducted via open pit mines in the early years of mining from the late 19th century until the 1950s , mining focus was on high grade ore that could be processed into steel without much change however , when that supply dried up , focus shifted to lower-grade ore ( taconite ) which requires extensive processing at large mining-processing facilities before moving to port dormant and exhausted open pit mines are a common feature along the iron range for instance , the virginia pilot is a project which focuses on redeveloping the grounds adjacent to the old mines into low- to moderate-income residential space currently , there are six mining-processing facilities in operation on the iron range united states steel owns and operates both keetac and minntac with mining and processing facilities in keewatin and mountain iron respectively steel dynamics and kobe steel formerly owned and operated mesabi nugget near hoyt lakes which does not yet mine its own material , but produced high-iron content nuggets from purchase iron ore concentrate the market for ore from the mesabi range was almost non-existent at this time because american steel furnaces were not built to deal with its powdery nature and steelmakers believed it to be poor ore by 1896 , he controlled the lake superior consolidated iron mines company , which was a holding company of the merritt brothers left several large-scale strikes took place on the mesabi iron range during the early 1900s the first began on july 20 , 1907 after the western federation of miners ( wfm ) asked oliver iron mining company for , among other demands , an eight-hour work day and a pay raise in june 1913 , the wfm organized a strike of the copper companies in the region , again demanding shorter hours and better pay
