the term '' genetic relationship '' is meant in the genealogical sense of historical linguistics , which groups most languages spoken in the world today into a relatively small number of families , according to reconstructed descent from common ancestral languages this frequently happens with sign languagesâ€”most famously in the case of nicaraguan sign language , where deaf children with no language were placed together and developed a new language there are also creole languages and constructed languages such as esperanto , which do not descend directly from a single ancestor but have become the language of a population ; however , they do take elements from existing languages however , many extinct languages are very poorly attested , and the fact that they can not be linked to other languages may be a reflection of our poor knowledge of them a number of sign languages have arisen independently , without any ancestral language , and thus are true language isolates in tanzania , for example , there are seven schools for the deaf , each with its own sign language with no known connection to any other language these and more are all presumed isolates or small local families , because many deaf communities are made up of people whose hearing parents do not use sign language , and have manifestly , as shown by the language itself , not borrowed their sign language from other deaf communities during the recorded history of these languages below is a list of known language isolates , arranged by continent , along with notes on possible relations to other languages or language families however , the genetic unity of some language families , like nilo-saharan , is questionable , and so there may be many more language families and isolates than currently accepted data for several african languages , like kwadi and kwisi , are not sufficient for classification native languages and language families of north america ( rev
