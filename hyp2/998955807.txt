in euclidean geometry , the basic concepts are points and ( straight ) lines in spherical geometry , the basic concepts are point and great circle or , in the ( also intrinsic ) axiomatic approach analogous to euclid 's axioms of plane geometry , '' great circle '' is simply an undefined term , together with postulates stipulating the basic relationships between great circles and the also-undefined '' points '' great circles in many ways play the same logical role in spherical geometry as lines in euclidean geometry , e.g many statements about the geometry of points and such '' lines '' are equally true in all those geometries provided lines are defined that way , and the theory can be readily extended to higher dimensions nevertheless , because its applications and pedagogy are tied to solid geometry , and because the generalization loses some important properties of lines in the plane , spherical geometry ordinarily does not use the term '' line '' at all to refer to anything on the sphere itself in spherical geometry , angles are defined between great circles , resulting in a spherical trigonometry that differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects ; for example , the sum of the interior angles of a spherical triangle exceeds 180 degrees the book of unknown arcs of a sphere written by the islamic mathematician al-jayyani is considered to be the first treatise on spherical trigonometry the book contains formulae for right-handed triangles , the general law of sines , and the solution of a spherical triangle by means of the polar triangle leonhard euler published a series of important memoirs on spherical geometry : l spherical geometry has the following properties : any two great circles intersect in two diametrically opposite points , called antipodal points however , if we only consider triangles whose sides are minor arcs of great circles , we have the following properties : the angle sum of a triangle is greater than 180° and less than 540° the composition ( product ) of two reflections-across-a-great-circle may be considered as a rotation about either of the points of intersection of their axes if '' line '' is taken to mean great circle , spherical geometry obeys two of euclid 's postulates : the second postulate ( '' to produce extend a finite straight line continuously in a straight line '' ) and the fourth postulate ( '' that all right angles are equal to one another '' ) a statement that is equivalent to the parallel postulate is that there exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180°
