security of the mountains to defeat count heinrich von bellegarde and 11,000 austrians in the second battle of marengo there were two major forces in italy , the 19,000-strong army of the alps under jean étienne championnet and 40,713 men of the army of italy these important events released 30,000 coalition troops for field operations kray was ordered to join the main army as quickly as possible joubert 's generals wished to wait for championnet 's army to come up on their left around 20 august before advancing saint-cyr arrived alone at novi ligure on 13 august , but suvorov declined to attack , hoping to lure the french into the plains where his superior cavalry and artillery might prove decisive meanwhile , the division of françois watrin moved down from the hills in the direction of tortona , giving every indication that the french offensive was still in full swing meanwhile , suvorov assumed that the french army would soon descend into the plains when the french came forward , kray and 27,000 soldiers would cut into their left flank while bagration 's 5,700-man russian advance guard would turn their right flank with luck the two forces would link hands behind the french ott 's left division included three battalions each of the deutschmeister nr smith gave the austrian regiment numbers and brigadiers one brigadier was johann i joseph , prince of liechtenstein , though the troops under his command are not given 144-145 derfelden 's 15,552-man russian corps was divided into a division under derfelden himself , a second division led by mikhail miloradovich and an advance guard led by bagration altogether , the 5,705-man advance guard counted 2,917 infantry and 2,788 cavalry according to one authority joubert 's army numbered 32,843 infantry and 2,087 cavalry for a total of 34,930 men saint-cyr stated the army was 34,000-strong but in another place gave a strength of 35,487 foot and 1,765 horse , or a total of 37,252 men not counting artillery lemoine 's 6,410-strong division included a first brigade under louis gareau with the 26th line and 80th line and one battalion of the 5th light and a second brigade under jean mathieu seras counting the 20th light and 34th line the 4,875-man reserve included bertrand clausel 's brigade with the 29th light and 74th line and louis partouneaux 's brigade with the 105th line and one battalion of the 26th light smith provided the numbers of battalions and squadrons in the french army facing north , the french held an arc of high ground from serravalle on the right to pasturana on the left at first light , the allies saw that the heights were crowned by the blue lines of french infantry instead of striking the flank of an enemy army on the move , the austrians of the right wing were making a frontal attack on a strong position 132 map next in line was watrin 's division which was still deployed in the low ground to the east of novi as they reached the top of the slope and tried to redeploy into line , they were struck by french counterattacks and forced back at last , ott 's columns were overthrown by the 26th light and 105th line and kray 's entire wing fell back to the bottom of the heights to reform encouraged by his success , partouneaux unwisely charged down into the plain where his troops were scattered by four squadrons of the archduke joseph hussars and kaiser dragoons but the austrian general refused to launch more attacks until the rest of the army joined the fight bagration 's troops were able to press back the french skirmish lines but were foiled when they encountered novi 's city wall moving to their right , they ran into quesnel 's brigade of laboissière 's division defending the heights as the russians pushed forward they were attacked in flank by gardanne 's men from novi and even by watrin 's troops from the french right flank miloradovich 's division was sent into the fray but every russian assault on the french center came to grief 143 in due course , derfelden 's division arrived at the front and was hurled into a new attack near novi around 11:30 am suvarov directed the allied left wing under melas to advance the austrian sent nobili 's two battalions and two squadrons south along the east bank of the scrivia river toward serravalle to guard against any french threat from that direction the remainder of the left wing moved down the west bank of the river with mittrowsky 's brigade on the left and the grenadier brigades on the right meanwhile , loudon 's grenadiers approached watrin 's right flank and mittrowsky 's command threatened an even deeper envelopment laboissière 's division managed to follow watrin 's men in their escape but at about this time the french army split into two halves which were not reunited until three days later 146 as the french left started to pull back , the allies closed in for the kill , unleashing their cavalry earlier , bellegarde had posted a battalion and four squadrons near pasturana on the far right smith claimed that the allies sustained about 900 killed , 4,200 wounded and 1,400 captured or missing , plus three guns chandler rounded the casualties to 8,000 allied and 11,000 french tucker , 11,000 were killed on the french side , and 9,000 on the allied side once the soldiers of the french left wing got clear of the braghena gorge , they quickly left the battlefeld far behind a new strategy put forward by the british and approved by czar paul and the austrians directed suvorov to take command of a new russian army assembling in switzerland this army would be formed by joining the russian troops in italy to another russian army in germany under alexander korsakov
