the tulip tree is often a large tree , 18–60 m high and 60–120 & nbsp ; cm in diameter the tree is known to reach the height of 191.8 feet ( 58.49 meters ) , in groves where they compete for sunlight , somewhat less if growing in an open field michigan trees leaves are slightly larger in l they start forming after around 15 years and are superficially similar to a tulip in shape , hence the tree 's name liriodendron trees are also easily recognized by their general shape , with the higher branches sweeping together in one direction , and they are also recognizable by their height , as the taller ones usually protrude above the canopy of oaks , maples , and other trees—more markedly with the american species appalachian cove forests often contain several tulip trees of height and girth not seen in other species of eastern hardwoods in the appalachian cove forests , trees 150 to 165 & nbsp ; ft in height are common , and trees from 166 to nearly 180 & nbsp ; ft are also found more liriodendron over 170 & nbsp ; ft in height have been measured by the eastern native tree society than for any other eastern species reports of tulip trees over 200 & nbsp ; ft have been made , but none of the measurements has been confirmed by the eastern native tree society the wood of the north american species ( called poplar or tulipwood ) is fine grained and stable the name canoewood probably refers to the tree 's use for construction of dugout canoes by eastern native americans , for which its fine grain and large trunk size is eminently suited
