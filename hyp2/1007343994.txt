in the contracted bladder , they are about apart and about the same distance from the internal urethral orifice ; in the distended bladder , these measurements may be increased to about a number of structures pass by , above , and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the bladder the arteries which supply the ureter vary along its course the lower third of the ureter , closest to the bladder , is supplied by branches from the internal iliac artery , mainly the superior and inferior vesical arteries there are many connections between the arteries of the ureter , particularly in the adventitia , which means damage to a single vessel does not compromise the blood supply of the ureter the these nerves travel in individual bundles and along small blood vessels to form the ureteric plexus sensation supplied is sparse close to the kidneys and increases closer to the bladder over time , the buds elongate , moving into surrounding mesodermal tissue , dilate , and divide into left and right ureters a kidney stone can move from the kidney and become lodged inside the ureter , which can block the flow of urine , as well as cause a sharp cramp in the back , side , or lower abdomen the affected kidney could then develop hydronephrosis , should a part of the kidney become swollen due to blocked flow of urine it is classically described that there are three sites in the ureter where a kidney stone will commonly become stuck : where the ureter meets the renal pelvis ; where the iliac blood vessels cross the ureters ; and where the ureters enter the urinary bladder , however a retrospective case study , which is a primary source , of where stones lodged based on medical imaging did not show many stones at the place where the iliac blood vessels cross if surgery is considered , it generally involves reattaching the ureters to a different spot on the bladder , and extending the part of the ureter that it is within the wall of the bladder , with the most common surgical option being cohen 's cross-trigonal reimplantation these include partial or total duplication of the ureter ( a duplex ureter ) , or the formation of a second irregularly placed ureter ; or where the junction with the bladder is malformed or a ureterocoele develops ( usually in that location ) if the ureters have been resited as a result of surgery , for example due to a kidney transplant or due to past surgery for vesicuureteric reflux , that site may also become narrowed if the cause can not be removed , a nephrostomy may be required , which is the insertion of a tube connected to the renal pelvis which directly drains urine into a stoma bag it is usually due to cancer of the urothelium , the cells that line the surface of the ureters ureteral cancer is most often due to cancer of the cells lining the ureter , called transitional cell carcinoma , although it can more rarely occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of cells lining the urethra have changed due to chronic inflammation , such as due to stones or schistosomiasis if a concerning lesion is seen , a flexible camera may be inserted into the ureters , called ureteroscopy , in order to view the lesion and take a biopsy , and a ct scan will be performed of other body parts ( a full-body ct scan ) to look for additional lesions after the cancer is staged , treatment may involve open surgery to remove the affected ureter and kidney if it is involved ; or , if the lesion is small , it may be removed via ureteroscopy several forms of medical imaging exist that are used to view the ureters and urinary tract ultrasound may be able to show evidence of blockage because of hydronephrosis of the kidneys and renal pelvis dye may also be injected directly into the ureters or renal tract ; an antegrade pyelogram is when contrast is injected directly into the renal pelvis , and a retrograde pyelogram is where dye is injected into the urinary tract via a catheter , and flows backwards into the ureters all vertebrates have two kidneys located behind the abdomen that produce urine , and have a way of excreting it , so that waste products within the urine can be removed from the body the urinary tract including the ureters , as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys , has been described by galen in the second century ad the insertion of a drainage tube into the renal pelvis , bypassing the uterers and urinary tract , called nephrostomy , was first described in 1941 more useful images were able to be produced when edwin hurry fenwick in 1908 pioneered the use of tubes covered in material visible to x-rays inserted into the ureters , and in the early 20th century when contrasts were injected externally into the urinary tract ( retrograde pyelograms )
