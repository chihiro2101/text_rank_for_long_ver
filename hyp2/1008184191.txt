there are two kinds of neurons involved in the transmission of any signal through the sympathetic system : pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic the activation of target tissue receptors causes the effects associated with the sympathetic system within this endocrine gland , pre-ganglionic neurons synapse with chromaffin cells , triggering the release of two transmitters : a small proportion of norepinephrine , and more substantially , epinephrine postganglionic sympathetic nerves terminating in the kidney release dopamine , which acts on dopamine d1 receptors of blood vessels to control how much blood the kidney filters because paravertebral and prevertebral ganglia are relatively close to the spinal cord , presynaptic neurons are generally much shorter than their postsynaptic counterparts , which must extend throughout the body to reach their destinations this tissue consists of cells that have pseudo-neuron like qualities in that when activated by the presynaptic neuron , they will release their neurotransmitter ( epinephrine ) directly into the bloodstream in the sympathetic nervous system and other components of the peripheral nervous system , these synapses are made at sites called ganglia fibers from the sns innervate tissues in almost every organ system , providing at least some regulation of functions as diverse as pupil diameter , gut motility , and urinary system output and function this response is also known as sympatho-adrenal response of the body , as the preganglionic sympathetic fibers that end in the adrenal medulla ( but also all other sympathetic fibers ) secrete acetylcholine , which activates the great secretion of adrenaline ( epinephrine ) and to a lesser extent noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) from it therefore , this response that acts primarily on the cardiovascular system is mediated directly via impulses transmitted through the sympathetic nervous system and indirectly via catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels , including many of those in the skin , the digestive tract , and the kidneys these receptors exist throughout the vasculature of the body but are inhibited and counterbalanced by beta-2 adrenergic receptors ( stimulated by epinephrine release from the adrenal glands ) in the skeletal muscles , the heart , the lungs , and the brain during a sympathoadrenal response the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system ( or cns ) , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are the pain is also usually referred to dermatomes that are at the same spinal nerve level as the visceral afferent synapse together with the other component of the autonomic nervous system , the parasympathetic nervous system , the sympathetic nervous system aids in the control of most of the body 's internal organs
