early united states opera houses served a variety of functions in towns and cities , hosting community dances , fairs , plays , and vaudeville shows as well as operas and other musical events given the popularity of opera in 18th and 19th century europe , opera houses are usually large , often containing more than 1,000 seats since the latter part of the 19th century , opera houses often have an orchestra pit , where many orchestra players may be seated at a level below the audience , so that they can play without overwhelming the singing voices at the metropolitan opera , for instance , sets are often changed during the action , as the audience watches , with singers rising or descending as they sing london 's royal opera house , which was remodeled in the late 1990s , retained the original 1858 auditorium at its core , but added completely new backstage and wing spaces as well as an additional performance space and public areas although stage , lighting and other production aspects of opera houses often make use of the latest technology , traditional opera houses have not used sound reinforcement systems with microphones and loudspeakers to amplify the singers , since trained opera singers are normally able to project their unamplified voices in the hall since the 1990s , however , some opera houses have begun using a subtle form of sound reinforcement called acoustic enhancement ( see below ) therefore , since the 1980s modern opera houses have assisted the audience by providing translated supertitles , projections of the words above or near to the stage more recently , electronic libretto systems have begun to be used in some opera houses , including new york 's metropolitan opera , milan 's la scala , and the crosby theatre of the santa fe opera , which provide two lines of text on individual screens attached to the backs of the seats so as to not interfere with the visual aspects of the performance in the 19th-century united states , many theaters were given the name '' opera house , '' even ones where opera was seldom if ever performed opera was viewed as a more respectable art form than theater ; calling a local theater an '' opera house '' therefore served to elevate it and overcome objections from those who found the theater morally objectionable
