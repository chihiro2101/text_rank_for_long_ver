in 1633 , although still below the canonical age , he took holy orders , and accepted the invitation of thomas risden , a former fellow-student , to supply his place for a short time as lecturer at st paul 's cathedral , '' jeremy taylor , bishop and theoloian '' , biographical sketches of memorable christians of the past at oxford , william chillingworth was then busy with his magnum opus , the religion of protestants , and it is possible that through his discussions with chillingworth taylor may have been turned towards the liberal movement of his age there he settled down to the work of a country priest in the autumn of the same year he was appointed to preach in st mary 's on the anniversary of the gunpowder plot , and apparently used the occasion to clear himself of a suspicion , which , however , haunted him through life , of a secret leaning to the roman catholic position this suspicion seems to have arisen chiefly from his intimacy with christopher davenport , better known as francis a sancta clara , a learned franciscan friar who became chaplain to queen henrietta ; but it may have been strengthened by his known connection with laud , as well as by his ascetic habits the author of the sacred order and offices of episcopacy or episcopacy asserted against the arians and acephali new and old ( 1642 ) , could scarcely hope to retain his parish , which was not , however , sequestrated until 1644 taylor probably accompanied the king to oxford here he became private chaplain to and benefited from the hospitality of richard vaughan , 2nd earl of carbery , whose mansion , golden grove , is immortalised in the title of taylor 's still popular manual of devotion , and whose first wife was a constant friend of taylor from time to time taylor appears in london in the company of his friend john evelyn , in whose diary and correspondence his name repeatedly occurs he was imprisoned three times : in 1645 for an injudicious preface to his golden grove ; again in chepstow castle , from may to october 1655 , on what charge does not appear ; and a third time in the tower in 1657 , because of the indiscretion of his publisher , richard royston , who had decorated his collection of offices with a print representing christ in the attitude of prayer jesus christ ( 1649 ) , inspired , its author tells us , by his earlier intercourse with the earl of northampton twenty-seven sermons ( 1651 ) , for the summer half-year twenty-five sermons ( 1653 ) , for the winter half-year the rule and exercises of holy living ( 1650 ) the rule and exercises of holy dying ( 1651 ) a controversial treatise on the real presence ( 1660 ) the rule and exercises of holy living provided a manual of christian practice , which has retained its place with devout readers he probably left wales in 1657 , and his immediate connection with golden grove seems to have ceased two years earlier at the restoration , instead of being recalled to england , as he probably expected and certainly desired , he was appointed to the see of down and connor , to which was shortly added the additional responsibility for overviewing the adjacent diocese of dromore no wonder that taylor , writing to james butler , 1st duke of ormonde shortly after his consecration , should have said , '' i perceive myself thrown into a place of torment '' this was taylor 's golden opportunity to show the wise toleration he had earlier advocated , but the new bishop had nothing to offer the presbyterian clergy but the alternative of submission to episcopal ordination and jurisdiction or deprivation
