the two are both rare-earth fluorocarbonates , but parisite 's formula of ca ( ce , la , nd ) 2 ( co 3 ) 3 f 2 contains calcium ( and a small amount of neodymium ) and a different ratio of constituent ions parisite could be viewed as a formula unit of calcite ( caco 3 ) added to two formula units of bastnäsite in fact , the two have been shown to alter back and forth with the addition or loss of caco 3 in natural environments although a scarce mineral and never in great concentrations , it is one of the more common rare-earth carbonates the formation of hydroxylbastnasite ( ndco 3 oh ) can also occur via the crystallization of a rare-earth bearing amorphous precursor the principal rare earth elements deposits of the united states -- a summary of domestic deposits and a global perspective steam is consistently used to condition the ground ore , along with soda ash fluosilicate , and usually tail oil c-30 this is done to coat the various types of rare earth metals with either flocculent , collectors , or modifiers for easier separation in the next step solvents are added ( solvent type and concentration based on area , availability , and cost ) to help separate eu , sm , and gd from la , nd , and pr additional solvent is added based on concentration and purity hno 3 typically added at a very high molarity ( 1–5 m ) , depending on la concentration and amount another method is to add hcl to la , creating lacl 3 hcl is added at 1 m to 5 m depending on la concentration
