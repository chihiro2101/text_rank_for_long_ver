virtually all we know about the life of tyrtaeus is found two entries of the suda , a byzantine encyclopedia redacted in the 10th century ad traditional accounts of his life were almost entirely deduced from his poetry or were simply fiction , such as the account by pausanias of his supposed transformation from a lame and stupid school teacher in athens to the mastermind of spartan victories against the messenians during the 19th and early 20th centuries , the picture of tyrtaeus ' life has been complicated by doubts about the authenticity of many of his verses , dated by various scholars to the 5th or 4th century bc according to gerber ( 1997 ) , however , '' that skepticism has now largely disappeared '' , and disagreements among scholars now essentially revolves around the version of fragment 4 that should be accepted as genuine ( plutarch 's or diodorus ' version , or a combination of the two ) , and about the dating of fragment 12 , which some critics have assigned to the time of xenophanes ( c the floruit given in the first entry of suda is perhaps too early since jerome offers a date of 633–632 modern scholars are less specific and provide instead date ranges for the second messenian war ( and thus for tyrtaeus ' life ) such as '' the latter part of the 7th century '' , v the confusion about his place of origin , which emerged by the 5th century bc , may have had several causes ancient athenian propaganda might indeed have played a role , although even plato , who could hardly have intended any denigration as an admirer of sparta , gave credence to the poet 's athenian origin fisher , '' the story was surely an invention by athenians , designed in the first instance for a predominantly athenian market scholars generally agree that tyrtaeus was a native of laconia for several reasons : the use of the first personal plural to include himself among the heraclidae whom zeus had given to sparta in fragment 2 ; the presence of occasional doric words in his vocabulary ; and his tone of authority when addressing spartan warriors , which would have been tolerated only if delivered by a spartan-born poet the crisis was mentioned by aristotle for its instructive power : the noble sentiment of line 1 seems to be original yet the vocabulary is entirely homeric and , though lines 5–7 are adapted from homer 's iliad ( 13.130–33 ) , '' '' iliad 13.130–33 , translated by r.lattimore , the iliad of homer , university of chicago press ( 1951 ) there is an important difference : homer describes the advance of one side in close formation , whereas tyrtaeus describes two sides meeting in the hoplite style of fighting
