the water freed from the rock lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock , which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its lighter density relative to the surrounding mantle rock , and pools temporarily at the base of the lithosphere for example , sector collapse ( where part of the flank of a volcano collapses in a massive landslide ) can trigger eruption only of a very shallow magma chamber magma differentiation and thermal expansion also are ineffective as triggers for eruptions from deep magma chambers two decade volcanoes that erupted in 1991 provide examples of stratovolcano hazards on june 15 , mount pinatubo spewed an ash cloud into the air and produced huge pyroclastic surges and lahar floods that devastated a large area around the volcano beginning in june , repeated collapse of this erupting dome generated ash flows that swept down the mountain 's slopes at speeds as high as apart from possibly affecting the climate , volcanic clouds from explosive eruptions also pose a serious hazard to aviation safety dense clouds of hot volcanic ash , caused by the collapse of an eruption column or by being laterally expelled from the partial collapse of a volcanic edifice or lava dome during explosive eruptions , can generate devastating pyroclastic flows or surges , which can sweep off everything in their paths lava flows from stratovolcanoes are generally not a significant threat to humans and animals because the highly viscous lava moves slowly enough for everyone to flee out of the path of flow fluid lavas are typically associated with the formation of broad shield volcanoes such as those of hawaii , but nyiragongo has very steep slopes down which lava can flow at up to rarely , generally fluid lava could also generate massive lava fountains , while lava of thicker viscosity can solidify within the vent , creating a block which can result in highly explosive eruptions lahars usually come from two sources : rainfall or the melting of snow and ice by hot volcanic elements , such as lava as per the above examples , while the unzen eruptions have caused deaths and considerable local damage in the historic past , the impact of the june 1991 eruption of mount pinatubo was global the so 2 mass in this cloud—about 22 million tons—combined with water ( both of volcanic and atmospheric origin ) formed droplets of sulfuric acid , blocking a portion of the sunlight from reaching the troposphere and ground an eruption the size of mount pinatubo tends to affect the weather for a few years ; the material injected into the stratosphere gradually drops into the troposphere , where it is washed away by rain and cloud precipitation its eruption cloud lowered global temperatures by as much as 3.5 & nbsp ; °c ( 6.3 & nbsp ; °f )
