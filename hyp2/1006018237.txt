173 deep-sea cores retrieved from the south china sea have extended the known reach of the eruption , suggesting that the 2,800 km³ calculation of the erupted mass is a minimum value or even an underestimate rampino and volcanologist stephen self argue that the eruption caused a '' brief , dramatic cooling or 'volcanic winter ' '' , which resulted in a drop of the global mean surface temperature by 3–5 & nbsp ; °c evidence from greenland ice cores indicates a 1,000-year period of low δ18o and increased dust deposition immediately following the eruption we observed no obvious change in sediment composition or fe/ti ratio , suggesting that no thermally driven overturn of the water column occurred following the toba supereruption the youngest toba eruption has been linked to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution about 70,000 years ago , which may have resulted in a severe reduction in the size of the total human population due to the effects of the eruption on the global climate a 10-year volcanic winter triggered by the eruption could have largely destroyed the food sources of humans and caused a severe reduction in population sizes see also however , evidence from pollen analysis has suggested prolonged deforestation in south asia , and some researchers have suggested that the toba eruption may have forced humans to adopt new adaptive strategies , which may have permitted them to replace neanderthals and '' other archaic human species '' furthermore , genetic analysis of alu sequences across the entire human genome has shown that the effective human population size was less than 26,000 at 1.2 million years ago ; possible explanations for the low population size of human ancestors may include repeated population bottlenecks or periodic replacement events from competing homo subspecies analyses of mitochondrial dna have estimated that the major migration from africa occurred 60,000–70,000 years ago , consistent with dating of the youngest toba eruption to around 75,000 years ago a 2018 study by chad yost and colleagues of cores from lake malawi dating to the period of the youngest toba eruption showed no evidence of a volcanic winter , and they argue that there was no effect on african humans
