attempts to isolate a global trait of '' suggestibility '' have not been successful , due to an inability of the available testing procedures to distinguish measurable differences between the following distinct types of '' suggestibility '' : to be affected by a communication or expectation such that certain responses are overtly enacted , or subjectively experienced , without volition , as in automatism deliberately to use one 's imagination or employ strategies to bring about effects ( even if interpreted , eventually , as involuntary ) in response to a communication or expectation wagstaff 's view is that , because '' a true response to a hypnotic suggestion is not a response brought about at any stage by volition , but rather a true non-volitional response , and perhaps even brought about despite volition '' , the first category really embodies the true domain of hypnotic suggestibility however , suggestibility can also be seen in extremes , resulting in negative consequences : a witness ' testimony is altered because the police or attorneys make suggestions during the interview , which causes their already uncertain observations to become distorted memories that is , the depth of hypnosis a given individual can achieve in a given context with a particular hypnotherapist and particular set of beliefs , expectations and instructions john kappas ( 1925–2002 ) identified three different types of suggestibility in his lifetime that have improved hypnosis : emotional suggestibility – a suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to inferred suggestions that affect emotions and restrict physical body responses ; usually associated with hypnoidal depth physical suggestibility – a suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to literal suggestions affecting the body , and restriction of emotional responses ; usually associated with cataleptic stages or deeper what has not been agreed on is whether suggestibility is : a permanent fixed detail of character or personality ; a genetic or chemical psychiatric tendency ; a precursor to or symptom of an activation of such a tendency ; a learned skill or acquired habit ; synonymous with the function of learning ; a neutral , unavoidable consequence of language acquisition and empathy ; a biased terminology provoking one to resist new externally introduced ideas or perspectives ; a mutual symbiotic relation to the other , such as the african conception of ubunthu or ubuntu ; related to the capacity of empathy and communication ; a matter of concordant personal taste between speaker / hypnotist and listener and listener 's like of / use for speaker 's ideas ; a skill or a flaw or something neutral and universal on this latter point , it must be pointed out that while some persuasion methods are more universally effective than others , the most reliably effective method with individuals is to personalize the approach by first examining their motivational , learning , behavioral and emotional styles ( et al when anyone is absorbed in someone else 's inspiring words as they outline an idea or way of thinking , the subjective attention is held because of the logic , the aesthetic , and the relevance of the words to one 's own personal experience and motivations popular media and layman 's articles occasionally use the terms '' suggestible '' and '' susceptible '' interchangeably , with reference to the extent to which a given individual responds to incoming suggestions from another some therapists may examine worries or objections to suggestibility before proceeding with therapy : this is because some believe there is a rational or learned deliberate will to hold a belief , even in the case of more convincing new ideas , when there is a compelling cognitive reason not to 'allow oneself ' to be persuaded a suggestion may direct the thoughts to notice a new concept , focus on a specific area within the world , offer new perspectives that later may influence action-choices , offer triggers for automatic behavior ( such as returning a smile ) , or indicate specific action types , given a fixed suggestion , what is the outcome ? ) clinical hypnosis : the study of clinical suggestion directed at the question : : : '' what is it that i can possibly say to this particular subject , in this specific context , to generate my goal of having them do xyz ? '' ( i.e according to some theoretical explanations of hypnotic responses , such as the role-playing theory of nicholas spanos , hypnotic subjects do not actually enter a different psychological or physiological state ; but , rather , simply acting on peer pressure – and , therefore , it is easier for them to comply than to disobey whilst this view does not dispute that hypnotized individuals truly experience the suggested effects , it asserts that the mechanism this takes place by has , in part , been '' socially constructed '' and does not , therefore , require any explanation involving any sort of an '' altered state of consciousness '' the problem as it relates to suggestibility is when children , and even adults , blend previous knowledge of similar experiences into their recollection of a single event children , particularly younger children , are prone to including details that are similar yet unrelated to the specific event showing that the age of a person is critical in their susceptibility to influence prior knowledge of an event can actually be effective at producing accurate recall of a particular situation , but can also be equally as effective at producing false memories an example would be that when a positive tone is used , it has shown to produce more detailed accounts of events little research has been carried out into the effects of anxious mood at the time of either the encoding of misleading post‐event information or the time of its possible retrieval , on subsequent suggestibility this is just one example of how a highly emotional situation such as an anxiety attack can create suggestibility misconception while it is true that did sufferers tend to score to the higher end of the hypnotizability scale , there have not been enough studies done to support the claim of increased suggestibility placebo response is also thought to be based on individual differences in suggestibility , at least in part suggestible persons may be more responsive to various forms of alternative health practices that seem to rely upon patient belief in the intervention more than on any known mechanism in addition to health-related implications , persons who are highly suggestible may be prone to making poor judgments because they did not process suggestions critically and falling prey to emotion-based advertising .
