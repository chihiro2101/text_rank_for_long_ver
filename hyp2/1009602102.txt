although two sex organs are present during the embryonic stages of all birds , once a chicken 's female hormones come into effect , it typically develops only the left ovary several medical conditions can result in an apparent sex change in humans , where the appearance at birth is somewhat , mostly , or completely of one sex , but changes over the course of a lifetime to being somewhat , mostly , or completely of the other sex this causes male sex characteristics to appear early ( or inappropriately ) the term '' sex change '' to refer to sex reassignment surgery , that is , a set of medical procedures undergone by transgender people to alter their sexual characteristics from male to female or from female to male , is considered offensive and inaccurate by many in the transgender community the term is also sometimes used for the medical procedures intersex people undergo , or , more often , are subjected to as children ( this process is often much more important to transgender people than the medical procedures themselves , although medically induced changes and surgeries may be needed to make a change of gender role possible , both socially and legally ; they can also have a very significant impact on the person 's well-being ) many people regard the term '' sex reassignment surgery '' as preferable to '' sex change '' sex in humans is usually determined by four factors : chromosomes gonads ( ovary and/or testicles and the associated gametes , eggs and sperm ) hormone status sex organ and secondary sex characteristics not all of these factors can be changed : chromosomes can not be changed gonads can be removed , but not replaced hormone status can be changed existing secondary sex characteristics can to some extent be changed ; existing ones mostly through surgery , non-existing ones can be induced to grow through hormones for example : changing a male genital anatomy into a good or even excellent female appearance with functioning is complicated but entirely possible ; changing a female genital anatomy into an even reasonably male appearing one , however , is extremely complicated and not successful very often ; function is always limited
