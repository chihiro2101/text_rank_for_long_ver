most mature anatum , except those that breed in more northern areas , winter in their breeding range most vagrants that reach western europe seem to belong to the more northern and strongly migratory tundrius , only considered distinct since 1968 it has become extinct in eastern north america , and populations there are hybrids as a result of reintroductions of birds from elsewhere it includes caucasicus and most specimens of the proposed race punicus , though others may be pelegrinoides ( barbary falcons ) , or perhaps the rare hybrids between these two which might occur around algeria it includes kreyenborgi , the pallid falcon , a leucistic morph occurring in southernmost south america , which was long believed to be a distinct species it is similar to nominate , but slightly smaller with a black ear region the variation kreyenborgi is medium grey above , has little barring below , and has a head pattern like the saker falcon , but the ear region is white it is very rare , and may only remain on a single island it is similar to brookei in appearance , but is slightly smaller and the ear region is entirely black if the barbary falcon ( see below ) is considered a distinct species , it is sometimes placed therein it is the largest subspecies , and it looks like an oversized and darker tundrius or like a strongly barred and large anatum in sri lanka this species is found to favour the higher hills while the migrant calidus is more often seen along the coast the barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying , beating only the outer part of its wings like fulmars sometimes do ; this also occurs in the peregrine , but less often and far less pronounced in mild-winter regions , it is usually a permanent resident , and some individuals , especially adult males , will remain on the breeding territory worldwide , it is estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 bird species ( up to roughly a fifth of the world 's bird species ) are predated somewhere by these falcons the peregrine falcon takes the most diverse range of bird species of any raptor in north america , with more than 300 species having fallen victim to the falcon , including nearly 100 shorebirds the peregrine falcon hunts most often at dawn and dusk , when prey are most active , but also nocturnally in cities , particularly during migration periods when hunting at night may become prevalent the peregrine requires open space in order to hunt , and therefore often hunts over open water , marshes , valleys , fields , and tundra , searching for prey either from a high perch or from the air large congregations of migrants , especially species that gather in the open like shorebirds , can be quite attractive to hunting peregrines using natural contours to surprise and ambush prey on the ground , have been reported and even rare cases of prey being pursued on foot a recent study showed the presence of peregrines benefits non-preferred species while at the same time causing a decline in its preferred prey the peregrine falcon is sexually mature at one to three years of age , but in larger populations they breed after two to three years of age to make this possible , the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male 's talons during the breeding season , the peregrine falcon is territorial ; nesting pairs are usually more than apart , and often much farther , even in areas with large numbers of pairs within a breeding territory , a pair may have several nesting ledges ; the number used by a pair can vary from one or two up to seven in a 16-year period in some regions , as in parts of australia and on the west coast of northern north america , large tree hollows are used for nesting before the demise of most european peregrines , a large population of peregrines in central and western europe used the disused nests of other large birds in many parts of its range , peregrines now also nest regularly on tall buildings or bridges ; these human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff ledges that the peregrine prefers for its nesting locations if the eggs are lost early in the nesting season , the female usually lays another clutch , although this is extremely rare in the arctic due to the short summer season the male ( called the '' '' ) and the female ( simply called the '' falcon '' ) both leave the nest to gather prey to feed the young additionally the versatility of the species , with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves , combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies , means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird this size range , evolved to fit various environments and prey species , is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies , approximately five to one ( approximately 1500 & nbsp ; g to 300 & nbsp ; g ) the males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies , and the females of the smaller subspecies , excel in the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove , quail , and smaller ducks the females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species , pheasant , and grouse until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the us were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the us endangered species act was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from canada and special circumstances finally , after years of close work with the us fish and wildlife service , a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2004 , the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years the development of captive breeding methods has led to peregrines being commercially available for falconry use , thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry the main reason for taking wild peregrines at this point is to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that can combine the best features of both species to create what many consider to be the ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse in addition , the pcb concentrations found in these falcons is dependent upon the age of the falcon while high levels are still found in young birds ( only a few months old ) and even higher concentrations are found in more mature falcons , further increasing in adult peregrine falcons these pesticides caused falcon prey to also have thinner eggshells ( one example of prey being the black petrels ) an alternate point of view is that populations in the eastern north america had vanished due to hunting and egg collection some controversy has existed over the origins of captive breeding stock used by the peregrine fund in the recovery of peregrine falcons throughout the contiguous united states several peregrine subspecies were included in the breeding stock , including birds of eurasian origin due to the extirpation of the eastern anatum ( falco peregrinus anatum ) , the near extirpation of the anatum in the midwest , and the limited gene pool within north american breeding stock , the inclusion of non-native subspecies was justified to optimize the genetic diversity found within the species as a whole since peregrine eggs and chicks are still often targeted by illegal poachers , it is common practice not to publicize unprotected nest locations populations of the peregrine falcon have bounced back in most parts of the world in canada , where peregrines were identified as endangered in 1978 ( in the yukon territory of northern canada that year , only a single breeding pair was identified ) , the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada declared the species no longer at risk in december 2017 800â€“1500 ) used the peregrine , along with several other birds of prey , in imagery as a symbol of '' aerial ( celestial ) power '' and buried men of high status in costumes associating to the ferocity of raptorial birds in the late middle ages , the western european nobility that used peregrines for hunting , considered the bird associated with princes in formal hierarchies of birds of prey , just below the gyrfalcon associated with kings
