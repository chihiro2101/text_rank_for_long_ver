( we should also suppose that the relevant surroundings are exactly the same as for earth ; it revolves around a star that appears to be exactly like our sun , and so on ) in his original article , putnam had claimed that the reference of the twins ' '' water '' varied even though their psychological states were the same john searle , for example , argues ( intentionality : an essay in the philosophy of mind ) that , once we discover that our water is h 2 o , we have the choice of either redefining it as h 2 o ( a classical reduction redefinition ) or continuing to allow the term water to refer to anything with the basic properties of water ( transparency , wetness , etc searle , along with others , considers this sufficient argument to '' solve '' the thought experiment altogether ; others , such as donald davidson , feel that variations on the experiment can be used to draw some of the same conclusions here , privileged self-knowledge is taken to be the idea that one can know the content of one 's thoughts without having to investigate the external world ( for empirical evidence ) they argue that when a thought experiment describes a state of affairs that is radically different from the actual one ( or what we think it to be ) , our intuitions can become unreliable , and hence the philosophical conclusions drawn from them may also be unreliable for example , notes that a ) if one looks at putnam 's own later criticisms of others ( for example his criticisms of jaegwon kim in his book the threefold cord ) one finds that implicitly he criticises his own earlier self ; and b ) that the persuasive power of the twin earth thought experiment/intuition pump relies on our turning a blind eye to aspects of the experiment in order that it establish that which putnam claims it to putnam has since conceded the point and subscribes to mcdowell 's neo-wittgensteinian therapeutic invocation of the mind as a structured system of object involving abilities ( what putnam has since defended as a neo-aristotelian picture of mind see his papers '' changing aristotle 's mind '' and '' aristotle after wittgenstein '' , both reprinted in putnam ( 1994 ) : words and life has demonstrated that the theory of natural kinds , which many have taken to be established and/or supported by putnam 's twin earth thought experiment does not find support in the practice of scientific classification putnam , who is well known for changing his philosophical positions on a variety of issues , criticized the experiment later in life because it is anti-functionalist
