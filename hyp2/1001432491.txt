micrometeoroids that fall to earth can provide information on millimeter scale heating events in the solar nebula sufficiently small micrometeoroids avoid significant heating on entry into the earth 's atmosphere since which time these samples of stratosphere-collected interplanetary dust ( called brownlee particles before their extraterrestrial origin was confirmed ) have become an important component of the extraterrestrial materials available for study in laboratories on earth fred whipple was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the upper atmosphere direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors , demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from comet tails , and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin today it is understood that meteoroids of all sorts are leftover material from the formation of the solar system , consisting of particles from the interplanetary dust cloud or other objects made up from this material , like comets this suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations '' moon dust and the age of the solar system most lunar samples returned during the apollo program have micrometeorite impacts marks , typically called '' zap pits '' , on their upper surfaces impacts by small objects with extremely high velocity ( 10 kilometers per second ) are a current area of research in terminal ballistics ) the risk is especially high for objects in space for long periods of time , such as satellites his studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote however , a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites , about the size of dust grains for spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit , some variety of the whipple shield has been almost universal for decades
