at the off-broadway or off-off-broadway level , the ld will occasionally be responsible for much of the hands-on technical work ( such as hanging instruments , programming the light board , etc the ld will also make sure that he or she has an accurate plan of the theatre 's lighting positions and a list of their equipment , as well as an accurate copy of the set design , especially the ground plan and section the ld must take into account the show 's mood and the director 's vision in creating a lighting design next to each instrument on the plan will be information for any color gel , gobo , or other accessories that need to go with it , and its channel number after focus has occurred the ld usually sits at a temporary desk ( tech table ) in the theater ( typically on the center line in the middle of the house ) where he or she has a good view of the stage and work with the light board operator , who will either be seated alongside him or her at a portable control console or talk via headset to the control room at the tech table , the ld will generally use a magic sheet , which is a pictorial layout of how the lights relate to the stage , so he or she can have quick access to channel numbers that control particular lighting instruments the ld may also have a copy of the light plot and channel hookup , a remote lighting console , a computer monitor connected to the light board ( so they can see what the board op is doing ) , and a headset , though in smaller theatres this is less common at an arranged time , the performers arrive and the production is worked through in chronological order , with occasional stops to correct sound , lighting , entrances , etc the lighting designer will work constantly with the board operator to refine the lighting states as the technical rehearsal continues , but because the focus of a '' tech '' rehearsal is the production 's technical aspects , the ld may require the performers to pause ( '' hold '' ) frequently at this point , the stage manager will begin to take over the work of calling cues for the light board op to follow once the show is open to the public , the lighting designer will often stay and watch several performances of the show , making notes each night and making desired changes the next day during notes call if the show is still in previews , then the ld will make changes , but once the production officially opens , normally the lighting designer will not make further changes changes should not be made after the lighting design is finished , and never without the ld 's approval many times , the lighting crew of a small theatre will consist of a single lighting designer and one to three people , who collectively are in charge of hanging , focusing and patching all lighting instruments the lighting designer may also take on other roles in addition to lights when they are finished hanging lights and programming cues on the board the lighting designer enters the light plot into the visualization software and then enters the ground plan of the theater and set design , giving as much three-dimensional data as possible ( which helps in creating complete renderings ) in addition to computer visualization , either full scale or small scale mock ups are a good method for depicting a lighting designer 's ideas if the production is large or especially complex , the lighting designer may hire additional lighting professionals to help execute the design while the duties that an ld may expect the associate ld to perform may differ from person to person , usually the ass't ld will do the following : attend design and production meetings with or in place of the ld attend rehearsals with or in place of ld and take notes of specific design ideas and tasks that the lighting department needs to accomplish assist the ld in generating the light plot , channel hookup and sketches if needed , the associate may need to take the set drawings and put them into a cad program to be manipulated by the ld ( however , this job is usually given to the assistant ld if there is one )
