in prokaryotes , transcription is carried out by a single type of rna polymerase , which needs to bind a dna sequence called a pribnow box with the help of the sigma factor protein ( σ factor ) to start transcription in eukaryotes , transcription is performed in the nucleus by three types of rna polymerases , each of which needs a special dna sequence called the promoter and a set of dna-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process ( see regulation of transcription below ) even though prerna molecules for both mrna and trna undergo splicing , the steps and machinery involved are different because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins , splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression and the size of a species proteome extensive rna processing may be an evolution made possible by the nucleus of eukaryotes in prokaryotes , transcription and translation happen together , whilst in eukaryotes , the nuclear membrane separates the two processes , giving time for rna processing to occur specific exportin molecules are responsible for the export of a given rna type in some cases rnas are additionally transported to a specific part of the cytoplasm , such as a synapse ; they are then towed by motor proteins that bind through linker proteins to specific sequences ( called '' zipcodes '' ) on the rna mrna carrying a single protein sequence ( common in eukaryotes ) is monocistronic whilst mrna carrying multiple protein sequences ( common in prokaryotes ) is known as polycistronic the coding region carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the genetic code to form triplets in prokaryotes translation generally occurs at the point of transcription ( co-transcriptionally ) , often using a messenger rna that is still in the process of being created in eukaryotes translation can occur in a variety of regions of the cell depending on where the protein being written is supposed to be many proteins are destined for other parts of the cell than the cytosol and a wide range of signalling sequences or signal peptide are used to direct proteins to where they are supposed to be however , in eukaryotes there is a great variety of different targeting processes to ensure the protein arrives at the correct organelle numerous terms are used to describe types of genes depending on how they are regulated ; these include : a constitutive gene is a gene that is transcribed continually as opposed to a facultative gene , which is only transcribed when needed a housekeeping gene is a gene that is required to maintain basic cellular function and so is typically expressed in all cell types of an organism some housekeeping genes are transcribed at a relatively constant rate and these genes can be used as a reference point in experiments to measure the expression rates of other genes in general gene expression is regulated through changes in the number and type of interactions between molecules that collectively influence transcription of dna and translation of rna regulation of transcription can be broken down into three main routes of influence ; genetic ( direct interaction of a control factor with the gene ) , modulation interaction of a control factor with the transcription machinery and epigenetic ( non-sequence changes in dna structure that influence transcription ) direct interaction with dna is the simplest and the most direct method by which a protein changes transcription levels genes often have several protein binding sites around the coding region with the specific function of regulating transcription these changes influence a transcription factor 's ability to bind , directly or indirectly , to promoter dna , to recruit rna polymerase , or to favor elongation of a newly synthesized rna molecule the nuclear membrane in eukaryotes allows further regulation of transcription factors by the duration of their presence in the nucleus , which is regulated by reversible changes in their structure and by binding of other proteins these effects are referred to as epigenetic and involve the higher order structure of dna , non-sequence specific dna binding proteins and chemical modification of dna expression of a gene coding for a protein is only possible if the messenger rna carrying the code survives long enough to be translated in a typical cell , an rna molecule is only stable if specifically protected from degradation rna degradation has particular importance in regulation of expression in eukaryotic cells where mrna has to travel significant distances before being translated by binding to specific sites within the 3′-utr , mirnas can decrease gene expression of various mrnas by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript estimate that > 45,000 mirna target sites within human mrna 3′utrs are conserved above background levels , and > 60 % of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to mirnas direct regulation of translation is less prevalent than control of transcription or mrna stability but is occasionally used inhibition of protein translation is a major target for toxins and antibiotics , so they can kill a cell by overriding its normal gene expression control one type of ptm can initiate another type of ptm , as can be seen in how ubiquitination tags proteins for degradation through proteolysis proteolysis , other than being involved in breaking down proteins , is also important in activating and deactivating them , and in regulating biological processes such as dna transcription and cell death similarly , the analysis of the location of protein expression is a powerful tool , and this can be done on an organismal or cellular scale investigation of localization is particularly important for the study of development in multicellular organisms and as an indicator of protein function in single cells ideally , measurement of expression is done by detecting the final gene product ( for many genes , this is the protein ) ; however , it is often easier to detect one of the precursors , typically mrna and to infer gene-expression levels from these measurements for expression profiling , or high-throughput analysis of many genes within a sample , quantitative pcr may be performed for hundreds of genes simultaneously in the case of low-density arrays a single array or '' chip '' may contain probes to determine transcript levels for every known gene in the genome of one or more organisms alternatively , '' tag based '' technologies like serial analysis of gene expression ( sage ) and rna-seq , which can provide a relative measure of the cellular concentration of different mrnas , can be used these profiles indicate the level of dna expression ( and hence rna produced ) of a certain protein in a certain tissue , and are color-coded accordingly in the images located in the protein box on the right side of each wikipedia page for genes encoding proteins , the expression level can be directly assessed by a number of methods with some clear analogies to the techniques for mrna quantification the most commonly used method is to perform a western blot against the protein of interest—this gives information on the size of the protein in addition to its identity it is very difficult to clone a gfp-fused protein into its native location in the genome without affecting expression levels so this method often can not be used to measure endogenous gene expression it is important to note that by fusing a target protein to a fluorescent reporter the protein 's behavior , including its cellular localization and expression level , can be significantly changed an expression system consists of a gene , normally encoded by dna , and the molecular machinery required to transcribe the dna into mrna and translate the mrna into protein using the reagents provided viruses are an excellent example where they replicate by using the host cell as an expression system for the viral proteins and genome in addition to these biological tools , certain naturally observed configurations of dna ( genes , promoters , enhancers , repressors ) and the associated machinery itself are referred to as an expression system this term is normally used in the case where a gene or set of genes is switched on under well defined conditions , for example , the simple repressor switch expression system in lambda phage and the lac operator system in bacteria genes have sometimes been regarded as nodes in a network , with inputs being proteins such as transcription factors , and outputs being the level of gene expression the node itself performs a function , and the operation of these functions have been interpreted as performing a kind of information processing within cells and determines cellular behavior
