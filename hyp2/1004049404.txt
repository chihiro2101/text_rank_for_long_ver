despite his father 's wish that he should study theology swammerdam started to study medicine in 1661 at the university of leiden 1665 he returned to the dutch republic and joined a group of physicians who performed dissections and published their findings his father pressured him to earn a living , but swammerdam persevered and in late 1669 published historia insectorum generalis ofte algemeene verhandeling van de bloedeloose dierkens ( the general history of insects , or general treatise on little bloodless animals ) as a result , swammerdam was forced , at least occasionally , to practice medicine in order to finance his own research in his scientific study swammerdam tried to prove that god 's creation happened time after time , and that it was uniform and stable having studied the reproductive organs of men and women at university he set out to study the generation of insects when swammerdam published the general history of insects , or general treatise on little bloodless animals later that year he not only did away with the idea that insects lacked internal anatomy , but also attacked the christian notion that insects originated from spontaneous generation and that their life cycle was a metamorphosis whereas modern biologists speak of the grub , the pupa and the adult as stages in the life cycle of one individual butterfly , harvey and his contemporaries always regarded the grub as one individual and the butterfly as another '' page 30 or a sudden change from one type of animal to another having believed that his scientific research was a tribute to the creator , he started to fear that he may be worshipping the idol of curiosities his religious crisis only interrupted his scientific research briefly and until his premature death aged 43 he worked on what was to become his main work of historie der insecten convinced that all insects were worth studying , swammerdam had compiled an epic treatise on as many insects as he could , using the microscope and dissection the drawing swammerdam produced of the internal anatomy of the queen bee was only published 1737 details of swammerdam 's research on bees had already been published elsewhere because he had shared his findings with other scientists in correspondence steno sent malpighi the drawings swammerdam had done of the experiments , saying '' when he had written a treatise on this matter he destroyed it and he has only preserved these figures two years after his death in 1680 it was translated into french and in 1685 it was translated into latin though swammerdam 's work on insects and anatomy was significant , many current histories remember him as much for his methods and skill with microscopes as for his discoveries a method he invented for the preparation of hollow human organs was later much employed in anatomy he had corresponded with contemporaries across europe and his friends gottfried wilhelm leibniz and nicolas malebranche used his microscopic research to substantiate their own natural and moral philosophy but swammerdam has also been credited with heralding the natural theology of the 18th century , were god 's grand design was detected in the mechanics of the solar system , the seasons , snowflakes and the anatomy of the human eye the portrait shown in the header is derived from the painting the anatomy lesson of dr tulp by rembrandt and represents the leading amsterdam physician hartman hartmanzoon ( 1591–1659 ) '' reading and writing the book of nature : jan swammerdam ( 1637–1680 ) site devoted to swammerdam short biography from a website that chronicles the '' rocky road to modern paleontology and biology '' biography written by matthew cobb , a professor at laboratoire d'ecologie in paris an english edition of swammerdam 's '' the book of nature , or , the history of insects '' from the history of science digital collection : utah state university the correspondence of jan swammerdam in emlo
