the landers were identical to that of the previous five venera missions and were to study the atmosphere and surface , each had instruments to study temperature , pressure , a uv spectrometer , a water concentration meter , a gas-phase chromatograph , an x-ray spectrometer , a mass spectrometer , and a surface sampling device the vega 1 lander 's surface experiments were inadvertently activated at from the surface by an especially hard wind jolt , and so failed to provide results the measured pressure at the landing site was 91 atm and the temperature was the two balloon aerobots were designed to float at from the surface , in the most active layer of the venusian cloud system the instrument pack had enough battery power for sixty hours of operation and measured temperature , pressure , wind speed , and aerosol density a package at the bottom carrying the batteries and a nephelometer to measure cloud density through light reflection tracking indicated that the motion of the balloons included a surprising vertical component , revealing vertical motions of air masses that had not been detected by earlier probe missions the data intensive examination of the comet covered only the three hours around closest approach they were intended to measure the physical parameters of the nucleus , such as dimensions , shape , temperature , and surface properties , as well as to study the structure and dynamics of the coma , the gas composition close to the nucleus , the dust particles ' composition and mass distribution as functions of distance to the nucleus , and the cometary-solar wind interaction vega mission images from the space research institute ( iki ) raw data from vega 1 and vega 2 on board instruments soviet exploration of venus hsao/nasa astrophysics data system ( ads ) â€“ a tool for studying atmosphere dynamics on venus
