before the royal assent by commission act 1541 allowed for delegation of the power to lords commissioners , assent was always required to be given by the sovereign in person before parliament the long parliament preferred the former translation , interpreting the oath as an undertaking to assent to any law passed by parliament , as the representative of the '' common people '' after the english civil war , it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly , but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills in 1678 , charles ii withheld his assent from a bill '' for preserving the peace of the kingdom by raising the militia , and continuing them in duty for two and forty days , '' '' house of lords journal volume 13 : 27 november 1678 '' william iii made comparatively liberal use of the royal veto , withholding assent from five public bills between 1692 and 1696 a similar bill was again passed by parliament and given royal assent in the following year a similar law , without the requirement for annual parliamentary sessions , was approved by the king in 1694 and became law the place bill ( vetoed 1694 ) would have prevented members of parliament from accepting any office or employment under the crown without standing for re-election in 1914 , george v took legal advice on withholding royal assent from the home rule act 1914 ; then highly contentious legislation that the liberal government intended to push through parliament by means of the parliament act 1911 may refer the bill to the supreme court of the united kingdom ( prior to 1 october 2009 , the judicial committee of the privy council ) for review of its legality measures , which were the means by which the national assembly for wales passed legislation between 2006 and 2011 , were assented to by the queen by means of an order in council order in council dated 9 july 2008 , approving the nhs redress ( wales ) measure 2008 , the first measure to be passed by the assembly on 6 may 2008 office of public sector information section 102 of the government of wales act 2006 required the clerk to the assembly to present measures passed by the assembly after a four-week period during which the counsel general for wales or the attorney general could refer the proposed measure to the supreme court for a decision as to whether the measure was within the assembly 's legislative competence under section 14 of the northern ireland act 1998 , a bill which has been approved by the northern ireland assembly is presented to the queen by the secretary of state for northern ireland for royal assent after a four-week waiting period during which the attorney general for northern ireland may refer the bill to the supreme court assent is given by means of letters patent in the following form set out in the northern ireland ( royal assent to bills ) order 1999 a recent example when the equivalent of the royal assent was refused was in 2007 , concerning reforms to the constitution of the sark chief pleas , letter from duke of atholl , 11 june 1757 , allowing and confirming an act to prevent clandestine marriages : after 1765 , the equivalent of the royal assent was at first signified by the letter from the secretary of state to the governor ; e.g the lieutenant governor must however refer any bill impacting on reserved powers ( defence , foreign relations , nationality law , the relationship between the island and the united kingdom and any matters relating to the monarch ) to the british government for advice , on which he is required to act church ( application of general synod measures ) act 1979 before 1994 , the equivalent of the royal assent was granted by order in council , as for a bill , but the power to grant the equivalent of the royal assent to measures has now been delegated to the lieutenant governor in each case , the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law two methods are available : the sovereign 's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament ; alternatively , each house may be notified separately , usually by the speaker of that house however , though both houses must be notified on the same day , notice to the house of commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the journals of the house of commons , whereas the senate must be sitting and the governor general 's letter read aloud by the speaker while royal assent has not been withheld for a bill backed by the government in the united kingdom since 1708 , it has often been withheld in british colonies and former colonies by governors acting on royal instructions in the united states declaration of independence , colonists complained that george iii '' has refused his assent to laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good and has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained ; and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected to attend to them since the balfour declaration of 1926 and the statute of westminster 1931 , all the commonwealth realms have been sovereign kingdoms , the monarch and governors-general acting solely on the advice of the local ministers , who generally maintain the support of the legislature and are the ones who secure the passage of bills in the united kingdom , a bill is presented for royal assent after it has passed all the required stages in both the house of commons and the house of lords under the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 , the house of commons may , under certain circumstances , direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the house of lords '' once a bill has completed all the parliamentary stages in both houses , it is ready to receive royal assent '' , bill becomes an act of parliament a list of all bills that have thus passed parliament is drawn up by the clerk of the crown in chancery ; this list is then approved by the clerk of the parliaments royal assent may be granted in parliament or outside parliament ; in the latter case , each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect the clerk of the parliaments , an official of the house of lords , traditionally states a formula in anglo-norman law french , indicating the sovereign 's decision the lords reading clerk reads the commission aloud ; the senior commissioner then states , '' my lords , in obedience to her majesty 's commands , and by virtue of the commission which has been now read , we do declare and notify to you , the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in parliament assembled , that her majesty has given her royal assent to the several acts in the commission mentioned '' hansard , 7 april 1967 , house of commons , columns 7–25 under the royal assent act 1967 , royal assent can be granted by the sovereign in writing , by means of letters patent , that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament and forasmuch as we can not at this time be present in the higher house of our said parliament being the accustomed place for giving our royal assent in australia , the formal ceremony of granting assent in parliament has not been regularly used since the early 20th century a similar practice is followed in new zealand , where the governor-general has not granted the royal assent in person in parliament since 1875 one result , conceived as part of a string of acts intended to demonstrate canada 's status as an independent realm , was that king george vi personally assented to nine bills of the canadian parliament during his 1939 tour of canada—85 years after his great-grandmother , queen victoria , had last granted royal assent personally in the united kingdom under the royal assent act 2002 , however , the alternative practice of granting assent in writing , with each house being notified separately ( the speaker of the senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the written declaration of royal assent ) , was brought into force as the act also provides , royal assent is to be signified—by the governor general , or , more often , by a deputy , usually a justice of the supreme court the royal assent ceremony takes place in the senate , as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the house of commons the belgian constitution requires a theoretically possible refusal of royal sanction to be countersigned—as any other act of the monarch—by a minister responsible before the house of representatives article 93 of that document gives the jordanian sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation sent to him from the national assembly ; if he vetoes it within that timeframe , the assembly may override his veto by a two-thirds vote of both houses ; otherwise , the law does not go into effect ( but it may be reconsidered in the next session of the assembly ) if the monarch fails to act within six months of the bill being presented to him , it becomes law without his signature while article 34 of the constitution of luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess to sanction and promulgate a new law for it to take effect , the required sanction was removed in 2008 , after grand duke henri informed his prime minister that he could not in good conscience assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country should the monarch ever choose to exercise this privilege , article 79 provides a means by which his veto may be over-ridden : '' if a bill has been passed unaltered by two sessions of the storting , constituted after two separate successive elections and separated from each other by at least two intervening sessions of the storting , without a divergent bill having been passed by any storting in the period between the first and last adoption , and it is then submitted to the king with a petition that his majesty shall not refuse his assent to a bill which , after the most mature deliberation , the storting considers to be beneficial , it shall become law even if the royal assent is not accorded before the storting goes into recess according to article 91 , the monarch shall give his or her assent and promulgate the new law within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the cortes generales
