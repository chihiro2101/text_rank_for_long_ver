'' timbre and texture in twentieth-century music '' , aspects of 20th century music , p ground bass or basso ostinato ( obstinate bass ) is a type of variation form in which a bass line , or harmonic pattern ( see chaconne ; also common in elizabethan england as grounde ) is repeated as the basis of a piece underneath variations dido 's opening aria '' ah , belinda '' is a further demonstration of purcell 's technical mastery : the phrases of the vocal line do not always coincide with the four-bar ground : '' purcell 's compositions over a ground vary in their working out , and the repetition never becomes a restriction purcell 's instrumental music also featured ground patterns a particularly fine and complex example is his fantasia upon a ground for three violins and continuo : the intervals in the above pattern are found in many works of the baroque period pachelbel 's canon also uses a similar sequence of notes in the bass part : two pieces by j.s.bach are particularly striking for their use of an ostinato bass : the crucifixus from his mass in b minor and the passacaglia in c minor for organ , which has a ground rich in melodic intervals : a performance of the entire piece can be heard here that consists of an ostinato shared between viola and cello supporting a melody in octaves in the first and second violins : both the first and third acts of wagner 's final opera parsifal feature a passage accompanying a scene where a band of knights solemnly processes from the depths of forest to the hall of the grail here , the ostinato pattern stays in the middle register of the piano & nbsp ; – it is never used as a bass '' the rhythmical current running through the music is what binds together these curious mosaic-like pieces however , performers of african popular music do not perceive these progressions in the same way the guajeo is a seamless afro-euro ostinato hybrid , which has had a major influence upon jazz , r & b , rock ' n ' roll and popular music in general in various popular music styles , riff refers to a brief , relaxed phrase repeated over changing melodies it may serve as a refrain or melody , often played by the rhythm section instruments or solo instruments that form the basis or accompaniment of a musical composition though they are most often found in rock music , heavy metal music , latin , funk and jazz , classical music is also sometimes based on a simple riff , such as ravel 's boléro rikky rooksby states : '' a riff is a short , repeated , memorable musical phrase , often pitched low on the guitar , which focuses much of the energy and excitement of a rock song '' in jazz and r & b , riffs are often used as the starting point for longer compositions all these songs use twelve bar blues riffs , and most of these riffs probably precede the examples given neither of the terms 'riff ' or 'lick ' are used in classical music instead , individual musical phrases used as the basis of classical music pieces are called ostinatos or simply phrases latin jazz often uses guajeo-based riffs in music , a vamp is a repeating musical figure , section , marshall , wolf ( 2008 ) the term frequently appeared in the instruction 'vamp till ready ' on sheet music for popular songs in the 1930s and 1940s , indicating the accompanist should repeat the musical phrase until the vocalist was ready a vamp at the beginning of a jazz tune may act as a springboard to the main tune ; a vamp at the end of a song is often called a tag '' take five '' begins with a repeated , syncopated figure in time , which pianist dave brubeck plays throughout the song ( except for joe morello 's drum solo and a variation on the chords in the middle section ) the music from miles davis 's modal period 1958–1963 ) was based on improvising songs with a small number of chords the jazz standard '' so what '' uses a vamp in the two-note '' sooooo what ? '' figure , regularly played by the piano and the trumpet throughout the afro-cuban vamp style known as guajeo is used in the bebop/latin jazz standard '' a night in tunisia '' in gospel and soul music , the band often vamps on a simple ostinato groove at the end of a song , usually over a single chord in soul music , the end of recorded songs often contains a display of vocal effects—such as rapid scales , arpeggios , and improvised passages 1970s-era funk music often takes a short one or two bar musical figure based on a single chord one would consider an introduction vamp in jazz or soul music , and then uses this vamp as the basis of the entire song ( '' funky drummer '' by james brown , for example ) jazz , blues , and rock are almost always based on chord progressions ( a sequence of changing chords ) , and they use the changing harmony to build tension and sustain listener interest unlike these music genres , funk is based on the rhythmic groove of the percussion , rhythm section instruments , and a deep electric bass line , usually all over a single chord '' in funk , harmony is often second to the 'lock , ' the linking of contrapuntal parts that are played on guitar , bass , and drums in the repeating vamp '' examples include stevie wonder 's vamp-based '' superstition '' and little johnny taylor 's '' part time love '' , which features an extended improvisation over a two-chord vamp in musical theater , a vamp , or intro , is the few bars , one to eight , of music without lyrics that begin a printed copy of a song in indian classical music , during tabla or pakhawaj solo performances and kathak dance accompaniments , a conceptually similar melodic pattern known as the lehara ( sometimes spelled lehra ) or nagma is played repeatedly throughout the performance this melodic pattern is set to the number of beats in a rhythmic cycle ( tala or taal ) being performed and may be based on one or a blend of multiple ragas the lehara may be interspersed with short and occasional improvisations built around the basic melody it is also permissible to switch between two or more disparate melodies during the course of the performance
