according to marshall , three general ethical approaches have emerged over the last 40 years : libertarian extension , the ecologic extension , and conservation ethics singer found it difficult to accept the argument from intrinsic worth of a-biotic or '' non-sentient '' ( non-conscious ) entities , and concluded in his first edition of '' practical ethics '' that they should not be included in the expanding circle of moral worth however , in a later edition of '' practical ethics '' after the work of næss and sessions , singer admits that , although unconvinced by deep ecology , the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible , but at best problematic whereas libertarian extension can be thought of as flowing from a political reflection of the natural world , ecologic extension is best thought of as a scientific reflection of the natural world the planet is characterized as a unified , holism entity with ethical worth of which the human race is of no particular significance in the long run it contrasts the intrinsic value ideas of 'deep ecology , ' hence is often referred to as 'shallow ecology , ' and generally argues for the preservation of the environment on the basis that it has extrinsic value – instrumental to the welfare of human beings in order to solidify the understanding that god had intended for humankind to use earths natural resources , environmental writers and religious scholars alike proclaimed that humans are separate from nature , on a higher order those that may critique this point of view may ask the same question that john muir asks ironically in a section of his novel a thousand mile walk to the gulf , why are there so many dangers in the natural world in the form of poisonous plants , animals and natural disasters , the answer is that those creatures are a result of adam and eve 's sins in the garden of eden the first system of understanding holds religion as the basis of environmental stewardship john muir personified nature as an inviting place away from the loudness of urban centers , uncommon ground : rethinking the human place in nature , new york : w , 1995 , 69-90 ; the use of abrahamic religious allusions assisted muir and the sierra club to create support for some of the first public nature preserves references like these assist the general public to make a connection between paintings done at the hudson river school , ansel adams ' photographs , along with other types of media , and their religion or spirituality anthropocentrism is the position that humans are the most important or critical element in any given situation ; that the human race must always be its own primary concern in fact , based on this very assumption , a philosophical article has explored recently the possibility of humans ' willing extinction as a gesture toward other beings weak anthropocentrism , however , argues that reality can only be interpreted from a human point of view , thus humans have to be at the centre of reality as they see it another point of view has been developed by bryan norton , who has become one of the essential actors of environmental ethics by launching environmental pragmatism , now one of its leading trends instead , norton distinguishes between strong anthropocentrism and weak-or-extended-anthropocentrism and argues that the former must underestimate the diversity of instrumental values humans may derive from the natural world biotic ethics are based on the human identity as part of gene/protein organic life whose effective purpose is self-propagation humans can secure the future of life , and this future can give human existence a cosmic purpose differing conceptions of the treatment of and obligations towards animals , particularly those living in the wild , within animal ethics and environmental ethics has been a source of controversy between the two ethical positions ; some ethicists have asserted that the two positions are incompatible , while others have argued that these disagreements can be overcome center for environmental philosophy unt dept of philosophy creation care reading room : extensive online resources for environment and faith ( tyndale seminary ) category list -- - religion-online.org '' ecology/environment '' islam , christianity and the environment
