after the defeat of tipu sultan , most of south india came either under the company 's direct rule , or under its indirect political control as part a princely state in a subsidiary alliance especially during the battle of britain in 1940 , gandhi resisted calls for massive civil disobedience movements that came from within as well as outside his party , stating he did not seek india 's self-rule out of the ashes of a destroyed britain in 1942 , the congress launched the quit india movement the provisional free indian government in exile reorganised the indian national army composed of indian pows and volunteer indian expatriates in south-east asia , with the help of the japanese its aim was to reach india as a fighting force that would build on public resentment to inspire revolt among indian soldiers of the raj the quit india movement ( bharat chhodo andolan ) or the august movement was a civil disobedience movement in india which commenced on 8 august 1942 in response to gandhi 's call for immediate self-rule by indians and against sending indians to world war ii in addition , congress-led the quit india movement to demand the british to leave india and transfer the political power to a representative government in addition , this movement was addressed directly to women as '' disciplined soldiers of indian freedom '' and they had to keep the war for independence to go on ( against british rule ) in march 1942 , faced with an increasingly dissatisfied sub-continent only reluctantly participating in the war , and deteriorations in the war situation in europe and south east asia , and with growing dissatisfactions among indian troops- especially in europe- and among the civilian population in the sub-continent , the british government sent a delegation to india under stafford cripps , in what came to be known as the cripps ' mission the purpose of the mission was to negotiate with the indian national congress a deal to obtain total co-operation during the war , in return of progressive devolution and distribution of power from the crown and the viceroy to elected indian legislature 41 ( 2 ) , 325–355.pp:332 to force the british raj to meet its demands and to obtain definitive word on total self-rule , the congress took the decision to launch the quit india movement all the other major parties rejected the quit india plan , and most cooperated closely with the british , as did the princely states , the civil service , and the police there was opposition to the quit india movement from several political quarters who were fighting for indian self-rule vinayak damodar savarkar , the president of the hindu mahasabha at that time , even went to the extent of writing a letter titled '' stick to your posts '' , in which he instructed hindu sabhaites who happened to be '' members of municipalities , local bodies , legislatures or those serving in the army.to stick to their posts '' across the country , and not to join the quit india movement at any cost the bombay government ( british ) appreciated the rss as such , by noting that , the sangh has scrupulously kept itself within the law , and in particular , has refrained from taking part in the disturbances that broke out in august 1942 further , the british government also asserted that at sangh meetings organised during the times of anti-british movements started and fought by the indian national congress , speakers urged the sangh members to keep aloof from the congress movement and these instructions were generally observed however , such an attitude during the indian independence movement also led to the sangh being viewed with distrust and anger , both by the general indian public , as well as certain members of the organisation itself notes on

with this , the assessment may be made that it described in crystal clear terms to the government that the british indian armed forces could no longer be universally relied upon for support in crisis , and even more it was more likely itself to be the source of the sparks that would ignite trouble in a country fast slipping out of the scenario of political settlement world war ii was one of the most significant factors in accelerating indian independence , and the independence of many british and non-british colonies the war also forced the british to come to an agreement with indian leaders to grant them independence if they helped with war efforts since india had one of the largest armies with the speedy passage of the indian independence act 1947 , at 11:57 on yom-e-istiqlal pakistan was declared a separate nation eventually , 15 august became independence day for india marking the end of british india also on 15 august , both pakistan and india had the right to remain in or remove themselves from the british commonwealth patel took on the responsibility for bringing 565 princely states into the union of india , steering efforts by his '' iron fist in a velvet glove ''
