in star raiders , this part of the game takes the form of a '' galactic chart '' display dividing the game 's large-scale world into a grid of sectors , some of which are empty , while other are occupied by enemy ships or a friendly '' starbase '' flying about in the 3d view with the ship 's normal engines is sufficient for travel within a sector ; travel between sectors is via '' hyperspace '' , accomplished through an elaborate and noisy '' hyperwarp '' sequence with graphics loosely reminiscent of the star wars and star trek films in which the stars seemed to stretch to radial lines in contrast to many games of the era , the player can actually win the game by destroying all enemy ships in the galaxy the rating depends on a formula involving the game play level , energy and time used , star bases destroyed ( both by player or the enemy ) , the number of enemies destroyed , and whether the player succeeded in destroying all enemies , was destroyed , or aborted ( quit or ran out of energy ) the mission star raiders was unusual at the time for atari , as it made relatively few game cartridges for its computers , with most being adaptations of atari 2600 titles enemy ships , shots , and most other moving objects use atari 's variant of hardware sprites , known as player-missile graphics , which have their own color registers independent of the current screen graphics mode this version is nearly identical to the computer version , but takes advantage of the 5200 's analog joystick by allowing for variable speed turning , and puts all the game functions in the player 's hand via the controller 's 12-button keypad although the controller was designed to accept overlays for compatibility with multiple games , star raiders was the only game to utilize it it is a very different game in many ways , with more enemy ship types , different weapons , slower action , and a map featuring a triangular grid instead of a square one , which makes it much easier for the zylon ships to surround starbases while criticizing the violent gameplay , after seeing a demonstration ted nelson wrote , '' the atari machine is the most extraordinary computer graphics box ever made , and star raiders is its virtuoso demonstration game '' the magazine reported that star raiders complexity encouraged cooperative gameplay , and that '' over twenty hours of grueling tests by a battery of ingenious children '' had proven that it was free of bugs electronic games agreed , reporting that it '' is the game that , in the opinion of many , sells a lot of 400 computers systems '' , and '' has established the standards prospective software marketed will be trying to surpass over the next year or so '' it was just a game , yes , but it revolutionized the idea of what a personal computer could be made to do the action is fast , the graphics are gorgeous , and i 've spent entirely too much time with it '' on march 12 , 2007 , the new york times reported that star raiders was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time , the so-called game canon the library of congress took up a video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list , including star raiders had no relationship to the original other than the name , and was , in fact , merely a rebranded game originally developed as a licensed tie-in for the movie the last starfighter wilmunder mentioned he had been part of a team working on 8-bit computer games and decided to make a sequel to star raiders this version of star raiders ii is faithful to the original gameplay , but designed to make use of new 32 & nbsp ; kb cartridges a number of planets can also be attacked on the surface in a view based on the star wars arcade game , which was being developed down the hall from wilmunder 's office the game , in an untuned but functionally complete and playable state , was added to the internet archive along with basic documentation and wilmunder 's telling of the history of the game neubauer 's own solaris , for the atari 2600 , is both similar and in some ways more sophisticated than his earlier game , despite the difference in technology between the two systems
