the globe may be turned by hand within this ring , so as to place any given meridian upon it , directly under the celestial meridian l when the winch is put upon the axis v , and turn backward , the terrestrial globe , with its horizon and celestial meridian , keep at rest ; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east , by south , to west , carrying the sun y , and moon z , round the same way , and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon but when the winch is put upon the axis u , and turned forward , the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest ; and the earth , with its horizon and meridian , turn round from horizon to the sun and moon , to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest , and they were carried round it ; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon , and at the same times in the hour circle , whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven to rectify the sphere for use , first slacken the screw r in the upright stem r , and taking hold of the arm q , move it up or down until the given degree of latitude for any place be at the side of the stem r ; and then the axis of the sphere will be properly elevated , so as to stand parallel to the axis of the world , if the machine be set north and south by a small compass : this done , count the latitude from the north pole , upon the celestial meridian l , down towards the north notch of the horizon , and set the horizon to that latitude ; then , turn the nut b until the sun y comes to the given day of the year in the ecliptic , and the sun will be at its proper place for that day : find the place of the moon 's ascending node , and also the place of the moon , by an ephemeris , and set them right accordingly : lastly , turn the winch w , until either the sun comes to the meridian l , or until the meridian comes to the sun ( according as you want the sphere or earth to move ) and set the hour-index to the xii , marked noon , and the whole machine will be rectified — then turn the winch , and observe when the sun or moon rise and set in the horizon , and the hour-index will show the times thereof for the given day according to needham , the earliest development of the armillary sphere in china goes back to the astronomers shi shen and gan de in the 4th century bc , as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument 39–53 ( 45 ) during the western han dynasty ( 202 bc9 ad ) additional developments made by the astronomers luoxia hong ( : zh : 落下閎 ) , xiangyu wangren , and geng shouchang ( 耿壽昌 ) advanced the use of the armillary in its early stage of evolution the world 's first water-powered celestial globe was created by zhang heng , who operated his armillary sphere by use of an inflow clepsydra clock ( see zhang 's article for more detail ) in 323 ad the chinese astronomer kong ting was able to reorganize the arrangement of rings on the armillary sphere so that the ecliptic ring could be pegged on to the equator at any point desired the chinese astronomer and mathematician li chunfeng ( 李淳風 ) of the tang dynasty created one in 633 ad with three spherical layers to calibrate multiple aspects of astronomical observations , calling them 'nests ' ( chhung ) however , it was the tang chinese astronomer , mathematician , and monk yi xing in the next century who would accomplish this addition to the model of the armillary sphere ecliptical mountings of this sort were found on the armillary instruments of zhou cong and shu yijian in 1050 , as well as shen kuo 's armillary sphere of the later 11th century , but after that point they were no longer employed on chinese armillary instruments until the arrival of the european jesuits the famous clock tower that the chinese polymath su song built by 1094 during the song dynasty would employ yi xing 's escapement with waterwheel scoops filled by clepsydra drip , and powered a crowning armillary sphere , a central celestial globe , and mechanically operated manikins that would exit mechanically opened doors of the clock tower at specific times to ring bells and gongs to announce the time , or to hold plaques announcing special times of the day the english name of this device comes ultimately from the latin armilla ( circle , bracelet ) , since it has a skeleton made of graduated metal circles linking the poles and representing the equator , the ecliptic , meridians and parallels usually a ball representing the earth or , later , the sun is placed in its center when several rings or circles were combined representing the great circles of the heavens , the instrument became an armillary sphere however , the fully developed armillary sphere with nine circles perhaps did not exist until the mid-2nd century ad , during the roman empire islamic astronomy produced an improved version of the greek armillary sphere in the 8th century , and wrote about it in the treatise of dhat al-halaq or the instrument with the rings by the persian astronomer fazari ( d.c muslim astronomers also independently invented the celestial globe , which were used primarily for solving problems in celestial astronomy the armillary sphere was reintroduced to western europe via al-andalus in the late 10th century with the efforts of gerbert d'aurillac , the later pope sylvester ii ( r pope sylvester ii applied the use of sighting tubes with his armillary sphere in order to fix the position of the pole star and record measurements for the tropics and equator the structure of time going train and the mechanism of striking-release in the part of clock is influenced by the crown escapement which has been developed from 14th century , and is applied to gear system which had been improved until the middle of 17th century in western-style clockwork further advances in this instrument were made by danish astronomer tycho brahe ( 1546–1601 ) , who constructed three large armillary spheres which he used for highly precise measurements of the positions of the stars and planets renaissance scientists and public figures often had their portraits painted showing them with one hand on an armillary sphere , which represented the height of wisdom and knowledge the armillary sphere survives as useful for teaching , and may be described as a skeleton celestial globe , the series of rings representing the great circles of the heavens , and revolving on an axis within a horizon file : roger-bacon-statue.jpg sculpture of 13th-century english scientist roger bacon holding an armillary sphere , oxford university museum of natural history file : jan gossaert - young girl with astronomic instrument - wga9784.jpg young girl with an astronomical instrument , by jan gossaert , c in the end of the 15th century , the armillary sphere became the personal heraldic badge of the future king manuel i of portugal , when he was still a prince the intense use of this badge in documents , monuments , flags and other supports , during the reign of manuel i , transformed the armillary sphere from a simple personal symbol to a national one that represented the kingdom of portugal and in particular its overseas empire as a national symbol , the armillary sphere continued in use after the death of manuel i
