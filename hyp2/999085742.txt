an ad hoc network uses a connection between two or more devices without using a wireless access point ; the devices communicate directly when in range internet access via ad hoc networks , using features like windows ' internet connection sharing , may work well with a small number of devices that are close to each other , but ad hoc networks do not scale well wireless devices can '' listen '' for data traffic on other frequencies , and can rapidly switch from one frequency to another to achieve better reception one impediment to increasing the speed of wireless communications comes from wi-fi 's use of a shared communications medium : thus , two stations in infrastructure mode that are communicating with each other even over the same ap must have each and every frame transmitted twice : from the sender to the ap , then from the ap to the receiver thus a typical 54 mbit/s wireless connection actually carries tcp/ip data at 20 to 25 mbit/s by 2012 , 802.11n based access points and client devices have already taken a fair share of the marketplace and with the ieee 802.11n-2009 inherent problems integrating products from different vendors are less prevalent many wired networks base the security on physical access control , trusting all the users on the local network , but if wireless access points are connected to the network , anybody within range of the ap ( which typically extends farther than the intended area ) can attach to the network femtocell – a local-area base station using cellular network standards such as umts , rather than wi-fi homeplug – wired lan technology that has a few elements in common with wi-fi lightweight access point protocol – used to manage a large set of aps list of router firmware projects wi-fi array – system of multiple aps wi-fi direct – a wi-fi standard that enables devices to connect with each other without requiring a ( hardware ) wireless access point and to communicate at typical wi-fi speeds wimax – wide-area wireless standard that has a few elements in common with wi-fi
