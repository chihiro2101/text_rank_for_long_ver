numerous biomolecules exhibit the ability to dissolve certain metal cations in addition to these adventitious chelators , several biomolecules are specifically produced to bind certain metals ( see next section ) in the 1960s , scientists developed the concept of chelating a metal ion prior to feeding the element to the animal they believed that this would create a neutral compound , protecting the mineral from being complexed with insoluble salts within the stomach , which would render the metal unavailable for absorption amino acids , being effective metal binders , were chosen as the prospective ligands , and research was conducted on the metal–amino acid combinations if the mineral was taken from the edta ligand , the ligand could not be used by the body and would be expelled according to the association of american feed control officials ( aafco ) , a metal–amino acid chelate is defined as the product resulting from the reaction of metal ions from a soluble metal salt with amino acids , with a mole ratio in the range of 1–3 ( preferably 2 ) moles of amino acids for one mole of metal ferrous bis-glycinate is an example of one of these compounds that has been developed for human nutrition these systems were based on a co-monomer chelate with calcium on the surface of the tooth and generated very weak water resistant chemical bonding ( 2–3 mpa ) chelate complexes of gadolinium are often used as contrast agents in mris , although iron particle and manganese chelate complexes have also been explored chelation in the intestinal tract is a cause of numerous interactions between drugs and metal ions ( also known as '' minerals '' in nutrition ) although the treatment is often referred to as '' softening , '' chelation has little effect on the water 's mineral content , other than to make it soluble and lower the water 's ph level metal chelate compounds are common components of fertilizers to provide micronutrients most fertilizers contain phosphate salts that , in the absence of chelating agents , typically convert these metal ions into insoluble solids that are of no nutritional value to the plants
