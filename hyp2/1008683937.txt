it was used together with concepts of the united states as an ideal republic and a '' city upon a hill '' or new promised land it was a metaphor for the idealized process of immigration and colonization by which different nationalities , cultures and '' races '' ( a term that could encompass nationality , ethnicity and racist views of humanity ) were to blend into a new , virtuous community , and it was connected to utopian visions of the emergence of an american '' new man '' in his essay the significance of the frontier in american history , he referred to the '' composite nationality '' of the american people , arguing that the frontier had functioned as a '' crucible '' where '' the immigrants were americanized , liberated and fused into a mixed race , english in neither nationality nor characteristics '' the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in the united states after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities , cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 play of the same name , first performed in washington , d.c david foresees how the american melting pot will make the nation 's immigrants transcend their old animosities and differences and will fuse them into one people : '' here shall they all unite to build the republic of man and the kingdom of god intermarriage between whites and non-whites , and especially african-americans , was a taboo in the united states for a long time , and was illegal in many us states ( see anti-miscegenation laws ) until 1967 in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , european immigration to the united states became increasingly diverse and increased substantially in numbers many returned to europe but those who remained merged into the cultural melting pot , adopting american lifestyles the compromises that were reached in a series of immigration laws in the 1920s established the principle that the number of new arrivals should be small , and , apart from family reunification , the inflow of new immigrants should match the ethnic profile of the nation as it existed at that time as a result , two kinds of '' mixture talk '' developed : by the early 21st century , many white americans celebrated the impact of african-american culture , especially in sports and music , and marriages between white americans and african-americans were becoming much more common israel zangwill saw this coming in the early 20th century : '' however scrupulously and justifiably america avoids intermarriage with the negro , the comic spirit can not fail to note spiritual miscegenation which , while clothing , commercializing , and christianizing the ex-african , has given 'rag-time ' and the sex-dances that go with it , first to white america and then to the whole white world white americans long regarded some elements of african-american culture quintessentially '' american '' , while at the same time treating african americans as second-class citizens since world war ii , the idea of the melting pot has become more racially inclusive in the united states , gradually extending also to acceptance of marriage between whites and non-whites this trend towards greater acceptance of ethnic and racial minorities was evident in popular culture in the combat films of world war ii , starting with bataan ( 1943 ) throughout the history of the modern olympic games , the theme of the united states as a melting pot has been employed to explain american athletic success , becoming an important aspect of national self-image mark dyerson , '' 'america 's athletic missionaries ' : political performance , olympic spectacle and the quest for an american national culture , 1896–1912 , '' international journal of the history of sport 2008 25 ( 2 ) : 185–203 ; dyerson , '' return to the melting pot : an old american olympic story , '' international journal of the history of sport 2008 25 ( 2 ) : 204–23 the 2002 winter olympics was also a showcase of american religious freedom and cultural tolerance of the history of utah 's large majority population of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , as well representation of muslim americans and other religious groups in the u.s during and immediately after the first world war , the concept of the melting pot was equated by nativists with complete cultural assimilation towards an anglo-american norm ( '' anglo-conformity '' ) on the part of immigrants , and immigrants who opposed such assimilation were accused of disloyalty to the united states the newly popularized concept of the melting pot was frequently equated with '' americanization '' , meaning cultural assimilation , by many '' old stock '' americans opposition to the absorption of millions of immigrants from southern and eastern europe was especially strong among popular writers such as madison grant and lothrop stoddard , who believed in the '' racial '' superiority of americans of northern european descent as member of the '' nordicism '' , and therefore demanded immigration restrictions to stop a '' degeneration '' of america 's white racial '' stock '' in the united states , where the term melting pot is still commonly used , the ideas of cultural pluralism and multiculturalism have , in some circles , taken precedence over the idea of assimilation nonetheless , the term assimilation is still used to describe the ways in which immigrants and their descendants adapt , such as by increasingly using the national language of the host society as their first language in the 1990s , political correctness in the united states emphasized that each ethnic and national group has the right to maintain and preserve its cultural distinction and integrity , and that one does not need to assimilate or abandon one 's heritage in order to blend in or merge into the majority anglo-american society in the 21st century , most second and third- generation descendants of immigrants in the united states continue to assimilate into broader american culture , while american culture itself increasingly incorporates food and music influences of foreign cultures huntington in who are we ? the challenges to america 's national identity , have expressed the view that the most accurate explanation for modern-day united states culture and inter-ethnic relations can be found somewhere in a fusion of some of the concepts and ideas contained in the melting pot , assimilation , and anglo-conformity models under this theory , it is asserted that the united states has one of the most homogeneous cultures of any nation in the world this line of thought holds that this american national culture derived most of its traits and characteristics from early colonial settlers from britain , ireland , and germany when more recent immigrants from southern and eastern europe brought their various cultures to america at the beginning of the 20th century , they changed the american cultural landscape just very slightly and , for the most part , assimilated into america 's pre-existing culture , which had its origins in northwestern europe for example , the french and british governments and populace are currently debating whether islamic cultural practices and dress conflict with their attempts to form culturally unified countries mexico has seen a variety of cultural influences over the years , and in its history has adopted a mixed assimilationist/multiculturalist policy it is important to note , however , that from a mexican standpoint , the immigrants and their culture were no longer considered foreign , but mexican in their entirety upon the independence of mexico , mexico began receiving immigrants from central europe , eastern europe , the middle east and asia , again , bringing many cultural influences but being quickly labeled as mexican , unlike in the united states and canada , where other culture is considered foreign this assimilation is very evident , even in mexican society today : for example , banda , a style of music originating in northern mexico , is simply a mexican take on central european music brought by immigrants in the 18th century when it is considered that argentina was second only to the united states ( 27 million of immigrants ) in the number of immigrants received , even ahead of such other areas of newer settlement like australia , brazil , canada and new zealand ; and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence , the impact of the immigration to argentina becomes evident an estimated 8 % of the population is mestizo , and a further 4 % of argentines are of arab ( in argentina the arab ethnicity is considered among the white people , just like in the us census ) or asian heritage most of the 6 million european and arab immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950 , regardless of origin , settled in several regions of the country however , brazilian society has never been completely free of ethnic strife and exploitation , and some groups have chosen to remain separate from mainstream social life costa rican people is a very syncretic melting pot , because this country has been constituted in percentage since the 16th century by immigrants from all the european countries—mostly spaniards and italians with a lot of germans , british , swedes , swiss , french and croats—also as black people from africa and jamaica , americans , chinese , lebanese and latin americans who have mestized over time with the large native populations ( criollos , castizos , mulattos , blacks and tri-racial ) creating the national average modern ethnic composition however , society in the indian subcontinent has never been completely free of ethnic strife and exploitation , and some groups have chosen to remain separate from mainstream social life afghanistan seems to be in the process of becoming a melting pot , as customs specific to particular ethnic groups are becoming summarily perceived as national traits of afghanistan the term afghan was originally used to refer to the pashtuns in the middle ages , and the intention behind the creation of the afghan state was originally to be a pashtunistan , but later this policy changed , leading to the inclusion of non-pashtuns in the state as afghans today in afghanistan , the development of a cultural melting pot is occurring , where different afghanistan ethnic groups are mixing together to build a new afghan ethnicity composed of preceding ethnicities in afghanistan today , ultimately replacing the old pashtun identity which stood for afghan in the early years of the state of israel , the term melting pot ( כור היתוך ) , also known as '' ingathering of the exiles '' ( קיבוץ גלויות ) , was not a description of a process , but an official governmental doctrine of assimilating the jewish immigrants that originally came from varying cultures ( see jewish ethnic divisions ) activists such as the iraq-born ella shohat that an elite which developed in the early 20th century , out of the earlier-arrived zionist pioneers of the second and third aliyah ( immigration waves ) —and who gained a dominant position in the yishuv ( pre-state community ) since the 1930s—had formulated a new hebrew culture , based on the values of socialist zionism , and imposed it on all later arrivals , at the cost of suppressing and erasing these later immigrants ' original culture proponents of the melting pot policy asserted that it applied to all newcomers to israel equally ; specifically , that eastern european jews were pressured to discard their yiddish-based culture as ruthlessly as mizrahi jews were pressured to give up the culture which they developed during centuries of life in arab and muslim countries critics respond , however , that a cultural change effected by a struggle within the ashkenazi-east european community , with younger people voluntarily discarding their ancestral culture and formulating a new one , is not parallel to the subsequent exporting and imposing of this new culture on others , who had no part in formulating it others argue that the melting pot policy did not achieve its declared target : for example , the persons born in israel are more similar from an economic point of view to their parents than to the rest of the population the policy is generally not practised today though as there is less need for that—the mass immigration waves at israel 's founding have declined assimilation was a way for ethnic minorities to advance their standing within the russian society and state—as individuals or groups in the pre-spanish era the philippines was the trading nexus of various cultures and eventually became the melting pot of different nations
