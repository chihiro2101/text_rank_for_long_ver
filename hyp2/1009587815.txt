shaped like a section of a large aerofoil ( this creates a low pressure area above the wing much like an aircraft ) , the craft was propelled by four aero engines driving two submerged marine propellers , with a fifth engine that blew air under the front of the craft to increase the air pressure under it the vessel also required a depth of water to operate and could not transition to land or other surfaces it never saw actual combat , however , and as the war progressed it was eventually scrapped due to the lack of interest and perceived need , and its engines returned to the air force several must be used together to support a load above them by the 1950s , ford showed a number of toy models of cars using the system , but mainly proposed its use as a replacement for wheels on trains , with the levapads running close to the surface of existing rails kaario began designing a developed version of a vessel using an air cushion and built a prototype ( 'surface soarer ' ) , in 1937 kaario 's design included the modern features of a lift engine blowing air into a flexible envelope for lift levkov designed and built a number of similar craft during the 1930s , and his l-5 fast-attack boat reached in testing cockerell 's group was the first to develop the use of a ring of air for maintaining the cushion , the first to develop a successful skirt , and the first to demonstrate a practical vehicle in continued use this produced a ring of airflow , as expected , but he noticed an unexpected benefit as well ; the sheet of fast moving air presented a sort of physical barrier to the air on either side of it this effect , which he called the '' momentum curtain '' , could be used to trap high-pressure air in the area inside the curtain , producing a high-pressure plenum that earlier examples had to build up with considerably more airflow in theory , only a small amount of active airflow would be needed to create lift and much less than a design that relied only on the momentum of the air to provide lift , like a helicopter in terms of power , a hovercraft would only need between one quarter to one half of the power required by a helicopter in addition to providing the lift air , a portion of the airflow was bled off into two channels on either side of the craft , which could be directed to provide thrust testing quickly demonstrated that the idea of using a single engine to provide air for both the lift curtain and forward flight required too many trade-offs although the sr.n1 was successful as a testbed , the design hovered too close to the surface to be practical ; at even small waves would hit the bow latimer-needham and cockerell devised a high skirt design , which was fitted to the sr.n1 to produce the mk v , bill gunston , '' hydrofoils and hovercraft : new vehicles for sea and land '' , doubleday , 1969 , p.93 displaying hugely improved performance , with the ability to climb over obstacles almost as high as the skirt as part of consolidation of british helicopter activities by several aero companies into one experiments with the skirt design demonstrated a problem ; it was originally expected that pressure applied to the outside of the skirt would bend it inward , and the now-displaced airflow would cause it to pop back out when deforming pressure was applied to the outside of this design , air pressure in the rest of the skirt forced the inner wall to move in as well , keeping the channel open through these improvements , the hovercraft became an effective transport system for high-speed service on water and land , leading to widespread developments for military vehicles , search and rescue , and commercial operations bertin was an advocate of the '' multi-skirt '' approach , which used a number of smaller cylindrical skirts instead of one large one in order to avoid the problems noted above during the early 1960s he developed a series of prototype designs , which he called '' terraplanes '' if they were aimed for land use , and '' naviplanes '' for water today , they are found primarily in military use for amphibious operations , search and rescue vehicles in shallow water , and sporting vehicles on vehicles with several engines , one usually drives the fan ( or impeller ) , which is responsible for lifting the vehicle by forcing high pressure air under the craft some hovercraft use ducting to allow one engine to perform both tasks by directing some of the air to the skirt , the rest of the air passing out of the back to push the craft forward the british aircraft and marine engineering company saunders-roe built the first practical human-carrying hovercraft for the national research development corporation , the sr.n1 , which carried out several test programmes in 1959 to 1961 ( the first public demonstration was in 1959 ) , including a cross-channel test run in july 1959 , piloted by peter '' sheepy '' lamb , an ex-naval test pilot and the chief test pilot at saunders roe over 20 & nbsp ; million passengers had used the service as of 2004 – the service is still operating and is by far the longest , continuously operated hovercraft service as well as saunders-roe and vickers ( which combined in 1966 to form the british hovercraft corporation ( bhc ) ) , other commercial craft were developed during the 1960s in the uk by cushioncraft ( part of the britten-norman group ) and hovermarine based at woolston ( the latter being surface effect ship , where the sides of the hull projected down into the water to trap the cushion of air with normal hovercraft skirts at the bow and stern ) these were both used by rival operators hoverlloyd and seaspeed ( joined to form hoverspeed in 1981 ) to operate regular car and passenger carrying services across the english channel these were later joined by the french-built sedam n500 naviplane with a capacity of 385 passengers and 45 cars ; only one entered service and was used intermittently for a few years on the cross-channel service until returned to sncf in 1983 the service ceased on 1 october 2000 after 32 & nbsp ; years , due to competition with traditional ferries , catamaran , the disappearance of duty-free shopping within the eu , the advancing age of the sr.n4 hovercraft and the opening of the channel tunnel in finland , small hovercraft are widely used in maritime rescue and during the rasputitsa ( '' mud season '' ) as archipelago liaison vehicles avon fire and rescue service became the first local authority fire service in the uk to operate a hovercraft bethel is far removed from the alaska road system , thus making the hovercraft an attractive alternative to the air based delivery methods used prior to introduction of the hovercraft service the hovercraft is able to operate during the freeze-up period ; however , this could potentially break the ice and create hazards for villagers using their snowmobiles along the river during the early winter marketed as forthfast , the service used a craft chartered from hovertravel and achieved an 85 % passenger load factor from the 1960s , several commercial lines were operated in japan , without much success they can also be chartered for a wide variety of uses including inspections of shallow bed offshore wind farms and vip or passenger use the first application of the hovercraft for military use was by the british armed forces , using hovercraft built by saunders-roe experience led to the proposed bell sk-10 , which was the basis for the lcac-class air-cushioned landing craft now deployed by the u.s developed and tested in the mid-1970s , the lacv-30 was used by the us army to transport military cargo in logistics-over-the-shore operations from the early 1980s thru the mid 1990s the soviet union was also one of the first nations to use a hovercraft , the bora , as a guided missile corvette , though this craft possessed rigid , non-inflatable sides it proved an extremely successful design for a littoral fast attack craft , but due to fiscal reasons and doctrinal change in the navy , the hovercraft was soon withdrawn apart from the craft designed as '' racing hovercraft '' , which are often only suitable for racing , there is another form of small personal hovercraft for leisure use , often referred to as cruising hovercraft , capable of carrying up to four people just like their full size counterparts , the ability of these small personal hovercraft to safely cross all types of terrain , ( e.g ) and reach places often inaccessible by any other type of craft , makes them suitable for a number of roles , such as survey work and patrol and rescue duties in addition to personal leisure use this level of interest has naturally led to a hovercraft rental sector and numerous manufacturers of small , ready built designs of personal hovercraft to serve the need a real benefit of air cushion vehicles in moving heavy loads over difficult terrain , such as swamps , was overlooked by the excitement of the british government funding to develop high-speed hovercraft it was not until the early 1970s that the technology was used for moving a modular marine barge with a dragline on board for use over soft reclaimed land the initial concept of the air cushion barge has always been to provide a low-tech amphibious solution for accessing construction sites using typical equipment found in this area , such as diesel engines , ventilating fans , winches and marine equipment several attempts have been made to adopt air cushion technology for use in fixed track systems , in order to use the lower frictional forces for delivering high speeds the most advanced example of this was the aérotrain , an experimental high speed hovertrain built and operated in france between 1965 and 1977 the tracked hovercraft project and eric laithwaite maglev train system were contemporaneous , and there was intense competition between the two prospective british systems for funding and credibility the service , operated by hovertravel , schedules up to three crossings each hour , and provides the fastest way of getting on or off the island longest continuous use – the original prototype sr.n6 ( 009 ) was in service for over 20 & nbsp ; years , and logged a remarkable 22,000 & nbsp ; hours of use
