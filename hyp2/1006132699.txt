when two negatives are used in one independent clause , in standard english the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative ( see the robert lowth citation below ) : this is known as litotes however , depending on how such a sentence is constructed , in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence for this reason , it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one 's speech is lost there is n't no other way ! there 's some other way ! these two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech -- > in standard english , two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive for instance , '' i do n't disagree '' could mean '' i certainly agree '' , '' i agree '' , '' i sort of agree '' , '' i do n't understand your point of view ( pov ) '' , '' i have no opinion '' , and so on ; it is a form of '' weasel words '' however , the statement '' i do n't completely disagree '' is a similar double negative to '' i do n't disagree '' but needs little or no clarification with the meaning '' i completely agree '' , lowth would have been referring to litotes wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out however , the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work , which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished instead , some kind of problem is implied , though mr discussing english grammar , the term '' double negative '' is often , though not universally , applied to the non-standard use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation we ca n't not go to sleep ! the key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives in the first example , the verb to go separates the two negatives ; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer the last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive this is a valid argument since adjectives do indeed describe the nature of a noun ; yet some fail to take into account that the phrase no more is only an adverb and simply serves as an intensifier another argument used to support the position double negatives are n't acceptable is a mathematical analogy : negating a negative number results in a positive one ; e.g this shows that double negatives were present in colonial english , and thus presumably english as a whole , and were acceptable at that time '' ) another point of view is that this construction is not really an example of a '' double negative '' but simply a grammatical template for negation ( '' i never see you '' ) afrikaans shares with english the property that two negatives make a positive due to slavic influence , the double ( and sometimes even triple ) negative is quite common a few examples would be : איך האב קיינמאל נישט געזאגט ( '' i never did n't say '' ) איך האב נישט קיין מורא פאר קיינעם ניט ( '' i have no fear of no one not '' ) it is common to add נישט ( '' not '' ) after the yiddish word גארנישט ( '' nothing '' ) , i.e in latin a second negative word appearing along with non turns the meaning into a positive one : ullus means '' any '' , nullus means '' no '' , non.nullus ( nonnullus ) means '' some '' in the same way , umquam means '' ever '' , numquam means '' never '' , non.numquam ( nonnumquam ) means '' sometimes '' in many romance languages a second term indicating a negative is required '' this initial usage spread so thoroughly that it became a necessary element of any negation in the modern french language there are literary cases in which '' ne '' can be used without '' pas '' ; many of these are traditional phrases stemming from a time before the emphatic became an essential part of negation in italian , a second following negative particle non turns the phrase into a positive one , but with a slightly different meaning in asturian , an extra negative particle is used with negative adverbs : yo nunca nun lu viera ( '' i had not never seen him '' ) means '' i have never seen him '' and a mi tampoco nun me presta ( '' i neither do not like it '' ) means '' i do not like it either '' standard catalan and galician also used to possess a tendency to double no with other negatives , so jo tampoc no l'he vista or eu tampouco non a vira , respectively ( '' i neither have not seen her '' ) meant '' i have not seen her either '' with few exceptions , a simple negative ( οὐ or μή ) following another negative ( for example , οὐδείς , no one ) results in an affirmation : οὐδείς οὐκ ἔπασχε τι ( '' no one was not suffering '' ) means more simply '' everyone was suffering '' otherwise , the negatives simply work independently of one another : οὐ διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀκοντίζειν οὐκ ἔβαλον αὐτόν means '' it was not on account of their not throwing that they did not hit him '' , and one should not blame them for not trying saying '' i saw nobody '' in polish ( widziałem nikogo ) instead of the more usual '' i did not see nobody '' ( nikogo nie widziałem ) might mean '' i saw an instance of nobody '' or '' i saw mr nobody '' but it would not have its plain english meaning in czech , like in many other languages , a standard double negative is used in sentences with a negative pronoun or negative conjunction , where the verb is also negated ( '' nikdo nepřišel '' '' nobody came '' , literally '' nobody did n't come '' ) however , this doubleness is also transferred to forms where the verbal copula is released and the negation is joined to the nominal form , and such a phrase can be ambiguous : '' nikdo nezraněn '' ( '' nobody unscathed '' ) can mean both , '' nobody healthy '' as well as '' all healthy '' 21-36 however , in many cases , a double , triple quadruple negative can really work in such a way that each negative cancels out the next negative , and such a sentence may be a catch and may be incomprehensible to a less attentive or less intelligent addressee double or multiple negatives are grammatically required in hungarian with negative pronouns : nincs semmim ( word for word : '' doesn't-exists nothing-of-mine '' , and translates literally as '' i do not have nothing '' ) means '' i do not have anything '' these suffices are , however , never used alone , but always in connection with ei this phenomenon is commonplace in finnish , where many words have alternatives that are required in negative expressions , for example edes for jopa ( '' even '' ) , as in jopa niin paljon meaning '' even so much '' , and ei edes niin paljoa meaning '' not even so much '' thus , one can indicate necessity by emphasizing that not doing something would n't be proper for instance , しなきゃならない ( shinakya naranai , '' must '' ) literally means '' not doing it would n't be proper '' double negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech , while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning in many cases , the original sense of the new negative particle is not negative per se ( thus in french pas '' step '' , originally '' not a step '' '' not a bit '' ) , but in germanic languages , such as english and german the intermediate stage was a case of double negation , as the current negatives not and nicht in these languages originally meant '' nothing '' : e.g '' i did n't see nothing '' > > early modern english i saw not 130 a similar development to a circumfix from double negation can be seen in non-indo-european languages , too : for example , in maltese , kiel '' he ate '' is negated as ma kielx '' he did not eat '' , where the verb is preceded by a negative particle ma- '' not '' and followed by the particle -x , which was originally a shortened form of xejn '' nothing '' - thus , '' he did n't eat nothing ''
