by adjusting the gas pressurising organ using the gas gland or oval window the fish can obtain neutral buoyancy and ascend and descend to a large range of depths in early life stages , these fish must rise to the surface to fill up their swim bladders ; in later stages , the pneumatic duct disappears , and the gas gland has to introduce gas ( usually oxygen ) to the bladder to increase its volume and thus increase buoyancy thus a very high gas pressure of oxygen can be obtained , which can even account for the presence of gas in the swim bladders of deep sea fish like the eel , requiring a pressure of hundreds of bars elsewhere , at a similar structure known as the oval window , the bladder is in contact with blood and the oxygen can diffuse back out again in shallow water fish , the ratios closely approximate that of the atmosphere , while deep sea fish tend to have higher percentages of oxygen physoclist swim bladders have one important disadvantage : they prohibit fast rising , as the bladder would burst they are suited for detecting sound and vibrations due to its low density in comparison to the density of the fish 's body tissues in some deep sea fishes like the antimora , the swim bladder maybe also connected to the macula of saccule in order for the inner ear to receive a sensation from the sound pressure traditional wisdom has long held that the first lungs , simple sacs connected to the gut that allowed the organism to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions , evolved into the lungs of today 's terrestrial vertebrates and some fish ( e.g in embryonal development , both lung and swim bladder originate as an outpocketing from the gut ; in the case of swim bladders , this connection to the gut continues to exist as the pneumatic duct in the more '' primitive '' ray-finned fish , and is lost in some of the more derived teleost orders , sharks and rays ) split from the other fishes about 420 million years ago , and lack both lungs and swim bladders , suggesting that these structures evolved after that split the swim bladder of a fish can strongly reflect sound of an appropriate frequency this can be calculated by knowing a number of properties of the fish , notably the volume of the swim bladder , although the well-accepted method for doing so requires correction factors for gas-bearing zooplankton where the radius of the swim bladder is less than about 0.05 m this turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms , most particularly small mesopelagic fish , with swimbladders that reflected the sonar the swim bladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up , and , given the high pressures in the mesoplegic zone , this requires significant energy sampling via deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65 % of all deep sea fish biomass lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world 's oceans swim bladders are also used in the food industry as a source of collagen many anthropogenic activities like pile driving or even seismic waves can create high-intensity sound waves that cause a certain amount of damage to fish that possess a gas bladder
