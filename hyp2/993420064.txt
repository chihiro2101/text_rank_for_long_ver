first described by the france neurologist paul broca in the nineteenth century , expressive aphasia causes the speech of those afflicted to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits nonetheless , because their comprehension of spoken language is mostly preserved , and because their speech is usually good enough to get their point across , the agrammatic nature of their speech suggests that the disorder chiefly involves the expressive mechanisms of language that turn thoughts into well-formed sentences however , an intriguing line of research has demonstrated specific comprehension deficits in expressive aphasics as well if the damage extends posteriorly , visual connections are disrupted , and the patient will have difficulty understanding written language a fascinating corollary of this has come from research on aphasias in deaf users of sign language , who show deficits in signing and comprehension analogous to expressive and receptive aphasias in hearing populations these studies demonstrate that the grammatical functions of broca 's area and the semantic functions of wernicke 's area are indeed deep , abstract properties of the language system independent of its modality of expression another less commonly known aphasia is global aphasia , which generally manifests itself after a stroke affecting an extensive portion of the brain occurs , including infarction of both divisions of the middle cerebral artery and generally both broca 's area and wernicke 's area survivors with global aphasia may have great difficulty understanding and forming words and sentences , and generally experience a great deal of difficulty when trying to communicate people also with anomic aphasia tend to know how to use an object , but rather can not name the aforementioned object damage to the area connecting comprehension and expression together has the following symptoms : fluent speech , good comprehension , poor oral reading , repetition is poor and transpositions of sounds within words is very common
