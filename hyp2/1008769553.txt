a black hole occurs when more than a certain amount of matter and/or energy is located within a small enough space in 1974 , british physicist stephen hawking used quantum field theory in curved spacetime to show that in theory , the force of gravity at the event horizon was strong enough to cause energy to '' leak '' into the wider universe within a tiny distance of the event horizon careful analysis showed that if this happened , quantum effects would cause a '' partner wave '' carrying negative energy to be created and also pass into the black hole , reducing the black hole 's total mass , or energy this radiation does not come directly from the black hole itself , but rather is a result of virtual particles being '' boosted '' by the black hole 's gravitation into becoming real particles as the particle–antiparticle pair was produced by the black hole 's gravitational energy , the escape of one of the particles lowers the mass of the black hole an alternative view of the process is that vacuum fluctuations cause a particle–antiparticle pair to appear close to the event horizon of a black hole in order to preserve total energy , the particle that fell into the black hole must have had a negative energy ( with respect to an observer far away from the black hole ) this causes the black hole to lose mass , and , to an outside observer , it would appear that the black hole has just emitted a particle this means that no information loss is expected in black holes ( since the theory permits no such loss ) and the radiation emitted by a black hole is probably the usual thermal radiation a black hole of ( about the mass of the moon , or about across ) would be in equilibrium at 2.7 & nbsp ; k , absorbing as much radiation as it emits
