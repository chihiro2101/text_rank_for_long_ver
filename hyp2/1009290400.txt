all units used for the radius , focal point and depth must be the same a more complex calculation is needed to find the diameter of the dish measured along its surface this is sometimes called the '' linear diameter '' , and equals the diameter of a flat , circular sheet of material , usually metal , which is the right size to be cut and bent to make the dish the parabolic reflector functions due to the geometric properties of the paraboloidal shape : any incoming ray that is parallel to the axis of the dish will be reflected to a central point , or '' focus '' ) because many types of energy can be reflected in this way , parabolic reflectors can be used to collect and concentrate energy entering the reflector at a particular angle however , if the incoming beam makes a non-zero angle with the axis ( or if the emitting point source is not placed in the focus ) , parabolic reflectors suffer from an aberration called coma the precision to which a parabolic dish must be made in order to focus energy well depends on the wavelength of the energy if the dish is wrong by a quarter of a wavelength , then the reflected energy will be wrong by a half wavelength , which means that it will interfere destructively with energy that has been reflected properly from another part of the dish to prevent this , the dish must be made correctly to within about of a wavelength the wavelength range of visible light is between about 400 and 700 nanometres ( nm ) , so in order to focus all visible light well , a reflector must be correct to within about 20 & nbsp ; nm for comparison , the diameter of a human hair is usually about 50,000 & nbsp ; nm , so the required accuracy for a reflector to focus visible light is about 2500 times less than the diameter of a hair if the dish is symmetrical and made of uniform material of constant thickness , and if f represents the focal length of the paraboloid , this '' focus-balanced '' condition occurs if the depth of the dish , measured along the axis of the paraboloid from the vertex to the plane of the rim of the dish , is 1.8478 times f the focus-balanced configuration ( see above ) requires the depth of the reflector dish to be greater than its focal length , so the focus is within the dish however , if the reflector is used to focus incoming energy onto a receiver , the shadow of the receiver falls onto the vertex of the paraboloid , which is part of the reflector , so part of the reflector is wasted lighthouses also commonly used parabolic mirrors to collimate a point of light from a lantern into a beam , before being replaced by more efficient fresnel lenses in the 19th century a parabolic reflector pointing upward can be formed by rotating a reflective liquid , like mercury , around a vertical axis
