it is fitted with a 486-compatible bus unit ( though with an increased pin-count ) , an integrated heatsink and fan , and 32 kb of cpu cache , double the 16 kb offered on regular p54c chips the much faster 83 & nbsp ; mhz version , which supported both 25 ( 63 & nbsp ; mhz effective ) and 33 & nbsp ; mhz bus systems , launched much later the same year on october , and was very expensive at 299 compared to other upgrade alternatives , such as those based on am5x86 and cyrix cx5x86 chips ukt support page for the packard bell 450 motherboard in addition , some older chipsets do not support the write-back functionality of the chip 's level 1 cache , which could also reduce performance the original pentium chips ran at higher voltages than later models , with a slower 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus speed ( socket 4 , 5v ) although little known , intel did in fact release an overdrive chip for these sockets , that used an internal clock multiplier of 2 , to change them to a '' 120/133 '' machine in 1998 the pentium ii overdrive , part number podp66x333 , was released as an upgrade path for pentium pro owners combining the pentium ii deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 kb full speed l2 cache chip from the pentium ii xeon into a socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 & nbsp ; mhz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus the later '' dixon '' mobile pentium ii core would emulate this combination with its 256 kb of full-speed cache
