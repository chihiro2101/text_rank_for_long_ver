in like manner , with the more general ethical treatises on happiness ( περὶ εὐδαιμονίας β΄ ) , and on virtue ( περὶ ἀρετῆς ) there were connected separate books on individual virtues , on the voluntary , etc he referred knowledge ( episteme ) to that essence which is the object of pure thought , and is not included in the phenomenal world ; sensation ( aisthesis ) to that which passes into the world of phenomena ; opinion ( doxa ) to that essence which is at once the object of sensuous perception , and , mathematically , of pure reason - the essence of heaven or the stars ; so that he conceived of doxa in a higher sense , and endeavored , more definitely than plato , to exhibit mathematics as mediating between knowledge and sensuous perception that xenocrates , if he did not explain the platonic construction of the world-soul as crantor after him did , nevertheless drew heavily on the timaeus ; and further aristotle , de caelo , i plutarch unfortunately , does not give us any further details , and contented himself with describing the well-known assumption of xenocrates , that the soul is a self-moving number probably we should connect with this the statement that xenocrates called unity and duality ( monas and duas ) deities , and characterised the former as the first male existence , ruling in heaven , as father and zeus , as uneven number and spirit ; the latter as female , as the mother of the gods , and as the soul of the universe which reigns over the mutable world under heaven , stobaeus , ecl he appears to have called it in the highest sense the individual soul , in a derivative sense a self-moving number , that is , the first number endowed with motion 24 how xenocrates tried to establish and connect scientifically these assumptions , which appear to be taken chiefly from his books on the nature of the gods , cicero , de natura deorum , i hence he also appears to have maintained that as far as consciousness extends , so far also extends an intuition of that all-ruling divine power , of which he represented even irrational animals as partaking 590 but neither the thick nor the thin , to the different combinations of which he appears to have tried to refer the various grades of material existence , were regarded by him as in themselves partaking of soul ; plutarch , de fac nemesius , de natura hominis it is probable , that , after the example of plato , he designated the divine principium as alone indivisible , and remaining like itself ; the material , as the divisible , partaking of multiformity , and different , and that from the union of the two , or from the limitation of the unlimited by the absolute unity , he deduced number , and for that reason called the soul of the universe , like that of individual beings , a self-moving number , which , by virtue of its twofold root in the same and the different , shares equally in permanence and motion , and attains to consciousness by means of the reconciliation of this opposition vii.2.1028 recognized amongst contemporary platonists three principal views concerning the ideal numbers , and their relation to the ideas and to mathematical numbers : those who , like plato , distinguished ideal and mathematical numbers ; those who , like xenocrates , identified ideal numbers with mathematical numbers those who , like speusippus , postulated mathematical numbers only aristotle has much to say against the xenocratean interpretation of the theory , and in particular points out that , if the ideal numbers are made up of arithmetical units , they not only cease to be principles , but also become subject to arithmetical operations 3 he approximated to the pythagoreans in this , that ( as is clear from his explanation of the soul ) he regarded number as the conditioning principle of consciousness , and consequently of knowledge also ; he thought it necessary , however , to supply what was wanting in the pythagorean assumption by the more accurate definition , borrowed from plato , that it is only insofar as number reconciles the opposition between the same and the different , and has raised itself to self-motion , that it is soul 30 in them he thought he had discovered what , according to plato , plato timaeus god alone knows , and he among men who is loved by him , namely , the elements or principia of the platonic triangles de caelo convinced that the principia of the existent should be sought not in the material , not in the divisible which attains to the condition of a phenomenon , but merely in the ideal definitude of form he may very well , in accordance with this , have regarded the point as a merely subjectively admissible presupposition , and a passage of aristotle respecting this assumption aristotle , de anima , i should perhaps be referred to him he tried to supplement the platonic doctrine at various points , and at the same time to give it a more direct applicability to life 13 consequently , that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided , but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad , or rather , is used by us for that purpose 21 according , therefore , as what belongs to the intermediate region is adapted to bring about or to hinder the good , xenocrates appears to have designated it as good or evil , probably with the proviso , that by misuse what is good might become evil , and vice versa , that by virtue , what is evil might become good 6 according to this , happiness should coincide with the consciousness of virtue , aristotle , topica , ii though its reference to the relations of human life requires the additional condition , that it is only in the enjoyment of the good things and circumstances originally designed for it by nature that it attains to completion ; to these good things , however , sensuous gratification does not belong 11 ; seneca , epistulae , 85 in this sense he on the one hand denoted ( perfect ) happiness as the possession of personal virtue , and the capabilities adapted to it , and therefore reckoned among its constituent elements , besides moral actions conditions and facilities , those movements and relations also without which external good things can not be attained , clement of alexandria , stromata , ii 10 , 26 , 31 and on the other hand did not allow that wisdom , understood as the science of first causes or intelligible essence , or as theoretical understanding , is by itself the true wisdom which should be striven after by people , clement of alexandria , stromata ; cicero , academica , ii 44 , 45 and therefore seems to have regarded this human wisdom as at the same time exerted in investigating , defining , and applying xenocrates is known to have written a book on numbers , and a theory of numbers , besides books on geometry plutarch writes that xenocrates once attempted to find the total number of syllables that could be made from the letters of the alphabet
