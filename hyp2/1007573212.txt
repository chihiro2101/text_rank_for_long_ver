lamont served in successive governments under margaret thatcher and john major for a total of 14 years , in the departments of energy , industry , defence and the treasury in this position he acquiesced in major 's decision to join the european exchange rate mechanism ( erm ) at a central parity of 2.95 deutschmarks to the pound , although neither he or any other cabinet ministers were involved or informed about the decision before it had been made a year after the major government was reelected in the 1992 general election , winning the most votes of any political party in british electoral history , inflation fell to 4.3 % , falling to 1.3 % a year later lamont replaced major as chancellor in major 's new cabinet , thereby inheriting major 's exchange rate policy in his memoirs , lamont recalls a senior treasury civil servant answering his question on why britain had joined the erm as replying , '' it 's politics , '' to which lamont replied , '' i do n't think i would have given up the flexibility of the exchange rate by the time lamont was appointed chancellor , the conservative government 's principal economic objective was to regain control of inflation however controlling inflation through the targeting of the growth of the domestic money supply , as proposed in that manifesto , turned out to be more problematic than its authors had envisaged and during his time as chancellor , lawson had increasingly been drawn instead to targeting the exchange rate to provide an external monetary anchor asked at his first appearance as chancellor at the treasury select committee whether he agreed with his predecessor 's view on the depth and duration of the recession and not wishing to contradict major , lamont replied that '' there are reasons why one could believe that it will be relatively short-lived and relatively shallow newly appointed as chancellor , lamont therefore supported john major 's idea of britain negotiating an opt-out from the single currency at an intergovernmental conference held in rome on 15 december 1990 , lamont declared , '' i remain unconvinced that the potential benefits of a single currency are as great as its supporters allege in a minute to the cabinet 's defence and overseas policy committee the following month , lamont set out his three objectives for the negotiations : first , to ensure britain did n't have to join the single currency ; second , to ensure the opt-out was legally water-tight ; and third , to ensure that during the period in the run-up to the single currency , there should be no binding obligations on britain despite the conservatives ' surprise victory in the april 1992 general election , for these reasons , the erm policy proved increasingly unsustainable and collapsed on black wednesday , when lamont was forced to withdraw the pound from the erm despite assuring the public that he would not do so just a week earlier after major left office and published his memoirs , lamont publicly denied major 's version of events , claiming that major had effectively opted out of his responsibilities and left lamont to carry the can for that day 's actions speaking a few days after black wednesday , the governor of the bank of england , robin leigh-pemberton , argued that '' the decision to join the erm two years ago in the circumstances ; that , having joined , we were right to endeavour to stick it out ; and that , in the circumstances which evolved , we were right to withdraw lamont 's view expressed in his memoirs was more nuanced : without the discipline of the erm , the major government would have given up on the fight against inflation before black wednesday ; erm membership delivered a sharp break in britain 's inflation performance ; the judgment of the markets that the higher rates needed to maintain britain 's membership was undoubtedly correct ; '' the erm was a tool that broke in my hands when it had accomplished all that it could usefully do sir alan budd , the treasury 's chief economic adviser during the period and later appointed by gordon brown to the monetary policy committee , in an economic assessment of britain 's membership of the erm , has written , '' although it was certainly a political disaster , the case can be made that it was an economic triumph and marked the turning point in our macro-economic performance during the autumn of 1992 lamont became a press target in a string of largely fabricated stories : that he had not paid his hotel bill for '' champagne and large breakfasts '' from the conservative party conference ( in fact his bill had been forwarded on for settlement ) ; that he was in arrears on his personal visa credit card bill ( true ) ; that in june 1991 he had used taxpayers ' money to handle the fall-out from press stories concerning a sex therapist , who was using a flat he owned ( the treasury contributed £4,700 of the £23,000 bill which had been formally approved by the head of the civil service and the prime minister ; 1992/93 hc 383 ( select committee on members interests ) other things being equal , government borrowing tends to rise in recessions because of extra spending on benefits and because less money is being received from taxes ; lower inflation lessens the extent to which taxpayers are pulled into higher tax brackets ( fiscal drag ) in a letter to the chairman of the house of commons treasury select committee in october 1992 , lamont set out a new basis for the conduct of monetary policy centred on inflation targeting inflation targeting was the basis on which the bank of england was made independent by the blair government in 1997 , the bank 's monetary policy committee being made accountable for achieving the government 's inflation target according to alan budd , the treasury 's chief economic adviser during the period , the important step of central bank independence could only have been successful once monetary stability had been achieved ; '' in 1997 the bank of england was not asked to succeed where politicians had failed ; it was asked to maintain the rate of inflation , namely 2.5 % , that it inherited in budd 's view , the essential elements of the new framework and its success in achieving low and stable inflation were the establishment of an inflation target and the institution of monthly meetings with the governor of the bank of england to discuss interest rates in terms of the public sector net cash requirement , the definition currently in use to measure the uk government deficit , the actual deficit for 1993–94 of 6.9 % was the highest since 1975–76 at 9.2 % economic and fiscal strategy report and financial statement and budget report , the stationery office ( april 2009 ) , table c16 to reduce government borrowing , the march 1993 budget announced a rising wedge of tax increases – £0.5bn in the first year , £6.7bn in the second , rising to £10.3bn in the third , financial statement and budget report , hm treasury ( march 1993 ) , table 1.1 after the 2009 budget , the sunday times editorialised that lamont 's budget had been so badly received that he was out of his job within two months , '' but it fixed the public finances and set up the prosperity of the 1990s and beyond '' and derek scott , tony blair 's economic adviser from 1997 to 2003 , wrote that lamont was '' rightly praised '' for putting in place the post-erm framework , that stage of lamont 's career being '' due for rerating since , in addition to designing a proper framework for monetary policy ( later consolidated by bank of england independence in 1997 ) , he also took most of the tough decisions on spending and tax to put the public finances on the road to recovery sir alan walters , whose opposition to the erm as mrs thatcher 's economic adviser triggered nigel lawson 's resignation as chancellor , wrote on the buoyant state of the british economy in 2001 that '' all the difficult and correct decisions that produced this happy state of affairs were taken and implemented by norman lamont , who thus showed himself , in his mark 2 post erm version , to be not only the most effective but also the bravest chancellor since the war three weeks after the government 's massive loss in the by-election , on 27 may 1993 , lamont was sacked ( technically resigning from the government because he declined a demotion to become secretary of state for the environment ) , throwing ( by his own account ) major 's letter of regret at his departure unopened into the wastepaper basket , and giving a resignation speech in the house of commons on 9 june , that made clear his feeling that he had been unfairly treated , saying that the government 'gives the impression of being in office but not in power ' ; the then party chairman norman fowler dismissed the speech as '' dud , nasty , ludicrous and silly '' major and lamont agree that lamont had offered his resignation immediately after black wednesday and that major pressed him to remain in office in march 1995 he voted with the labour party in a vote on europe , and later that year he authored sovereign britain in which he envisaged britain 's withdrawal from the european union , and was talked of as a potential leadership challenger to john major ; in the event it was john redwood who challenged for the leadership the 1991 budget , in which he seized the opportunity presented by thatcher 's resignation to restrict mortgage interest tax relief to the basic rate of income tax and also cut the rate of corporation tax by two percentage points , was greeted by positive coverage in the economist which dubbed him a nimble novice the day after his dismissal from the treasury , sir samuel brittan wrote in the financial times that history was likely to record him as one of the better chancellors , citing his structural reforms of taxation , his determination to give priority to securing and maintaining low inflation and the delayed tax increases in his final budget according to ruth lea , writing 12 years later on the factors behind the subsequent performance of the british economy , lamont had introduced path-breaking macro-economic reforms including inflation targeting and the first steps towards an independent bank of england and had begun a programme of fiscal consolidation , which transformed the public finances in the period after his resignation , lamont became the first leading politician to raise the prospect of britain withdrawing from the european union '' at a private meeting of the conservative philosophy group in 1994 , he argued that withdrawal from the european union was an option that should be restored to the range of serious possibilities , d'ancona , who attended the meeting , wrote as a former chancellor , i can only say that i can not pinpoint a single concrete advantage that unambiguously comes to this country because of our membership of the european union , '' lamont told the group he rejected the argument made by douglas hurd , the foreign secretary , who had claimed that the debate in europe was turning britain 's way '' he implicitly challenged the view expressed by john major , the prime minister of the united kingdom : '' it has recently been said that the option of leaving the community was 'unthinkable '' he stopped short of arguing britain should unilaterally withdraw from the european union '' today , '' but warned : '' the issue may well return to the political agenda in february 2005 , it was reported in the times that lamont and john major had held up the release of papers concerning black wednesday under the freedom of information act later it emerged that the source of the story had been damian mcbride , then a treasury civil servant who as a result of this became a special adviser to the then chancellor , gordon brown who in 2009 resigned from a similar position in number 10 downing street following publication of emails indicating a plan to smear leading conservative politicians in october 2006 , he complained that the new party leader david cameron ( lamont 's political adviser around the time of black wednesday ) lacked policies in late 2008 , cameron asked lamont , together with fellow former chancellors geoffrey howe , nigel lawson and kenneth clarke , to provide him with strategic political and economic advice as britain 's banking and fiscal position worsened in 2008 , lord lamont became the president of the economic research council , britain 's oldest economics-based think tank yanis varoufakis maintained that lord lamont provided him with 'counsel ' , 'advice ' and was ' a pillar of strength ' while he unsuccessfully negotiated debt relief with the troika during his six months as greek finance minister in 2015
