when edward visited depressed mining villages in wales , his comment that '' something must be done '' the duke of windsor , p although edward 's comments had made him popular in wales , see , for example , williams , p he became extremely unpopular with the public in scotland following his refusal to open a new wing of aberdeen royal infirmary , saying he could not do so because he was in mourning for his father members of the british government became further dismayed by the proposed marriage after being told that wallis simpson was an agent of nazi germany as a result of these rumours and arguments , the belief strengthened among the british establishment that simpson could not become a royal consort british prime minister stanley baldwin explicitly advised edward that the majority of people would be opposed to his marrying simpson , indicating that if he did , in direct contravention of his ministers ' advice , the government would resign en masse the king responded , according to his own account later : '' i intend to marry mrs simpson as soon as she is free to marry & nbsp ; under pressure from the king , and '' startled '' at the suggested abdication , baldwin agreed to take further soundings on three options : edward and simpson marry and she become queen ( a royal marriage ) ; edward and simpson marry , but she not become queen , instead receiving some courtesy title ( a morganatic marriage ) ; or abdication for edward and any potential heirs he might father , allowing him to make any marital decisions without further constitutional implications mackenzie king told edward to do '' what he believed in his own heart was right '' and the canadian government appealed to the king to put his duty before his feelings for simpson governor general of canada lord tweedsmuir told buckingham palace and baldwin that canadians held deep affection for the king , but also that canadian public opinion would be outraged if edward married a divorcee michael joseph savage ( prime minister of new zealand ) rejected option 1 and thought that option 2 '' might be possible & nbsp ; as soon as the affair became public knowledge , churchill started to pressure baldwin and the king to delay any decisions until parliament and the people had been consulted in a private letter to geoffrey dawson , the editor of the times newspaper , churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because , given time , the king might fall out of love with simpson the royal physician bertrand dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease , but he eventually accepted , on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph , that baldwin 's heart was sound he was , however , unable to take any active role in the crisis because he was on holiday in jamaica with his mistress frances stevenson in early december , rumours circulated that the king 's supporters would join together in a '' king 's party '' , led by churchill in one section , edward proposed to say : baldwin blocked the speech , saying that it would shock many people and would be a grave breach of constitutional principles cabinet office files released in 2013 show that on or before 5 december 1936 , the home secretary , sir john simon , had ordered the general post office ( which controlled british telephone services ) to intercept '' telephone communications between fort belvedere and buckingham palace on the one hand and the continent of europe on the other '' on 5 december , having in effect been told that he could not keep the throne and marry simpson , and having had his request to broadcast to the empire to explain '' his side of the story '' blocked on constitutional grounds , the duke of windsor , pp following simpson 's divorce hearing on 27 october 1936 , her solicitor , theodore goddard , became concerned that there would be a '' patriotic '' citizen 's intervention ( a legal device to block the divorce ) , and that such an intervention would be successful it was , however , too late ; the king had already made up his mind to go , even if he could not marry simpson the government of the irish free state , taking the opportunity presented by the crisis and in a major step towards irish head of state from 1936-1949 , passed an amendment to its constitution on 11 december to remove references to the crown and abolish the office of governor-general of the irish free state ; the king 's abdication was recognised a day later in the external relations act but many members of the establishment were relieved by edward 's departure mackenzie king wrote in his diary on 8 december 1936 that edward 's '' sense of right or wrong has been largely obliterated by the jazz of life he has led for years '' and , upon receiving news of edward 's final decision to abdicate , '' if that is the kind of man he is it is better he should not be longer on the throne '' edward 's own assistant private secretary , alan lascelles , had told baldwin as early as 1927 : '' i ca n't help thinking that the best thing that could happen to him , and to the country , would be for him to break his neck the official address had been polished by churchill and was moderate in tone , speaking about edward 's inability to do his job '' as i would have wished '' without the support of '' the woman i love '' they the british do n't want me as their king , but i 'll be back as their leader
