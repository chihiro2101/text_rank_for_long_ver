before the last ice age about 50,000 years ago , the warwickshire avon was a small river which drained northwards to the river trent during the wolstonian glacial period , ice advanced into the midlands from the north , east and west blocking the flow of the avon to its former confluence with the trent after about 10,000 years , when the glacier finally retreated , the water was able to cut through the previous watershed and to escape to the southwest , so forming the present day route of the river he had already bought a number of mills on the river , but there were few objections from millers at those he did not own , for he built pound locks with two sets of gates , to enable vessels to pass by without the large loss of water associated with flash locks these were used to enable boats to pass over shoals , and with the exception of the one at pensham , were not built adjacent to mills perrott then intended to sell the navigation , but when the stratford canal was being promoted , he had a clause inserted into the bill to force the worcester and birmingham canal to make payments to him in view of the expected drop in tolls that the navigation would experience once the stratford canal was completed , there was fierce competition between the upper and lower avon companies , with coal from the worcester and birmingham coming up-river to evesham , and coal coming down-river from stratford the navigation was taken over by seven men , all connected with the stratford canal , who turned lucy 's lock at stratford into a two-rise staircase lock , constructed three new locks , and improved the river by dredging the upper avon was leased to the stratford canal from 1842 , but there was little traffic , and the lease was not renewed in 1847 the arrival of the oxford , worcester and wolverhampton railway at stratford sealed its fate , and when the company failed to sell the navigation to local landowners for £150 , they effectively abandoned it in 1857 by 1962 , lant had raised over £50,000 , the 7 locks from tewkesbury to evesham were restored to working order , re-opening the lower avon , and plans were already being made to rebuild evesham town lock and press on towards stratford collins brothers , who owned the lock site , with the main dam , sluice and weir , donated them to the lower avon navigation trust in 1966 , extending the jurisdiction of the lower avon above its historical limits the other waterway to stratford , the stratford-upon-avon canal , had been restored by the national trust and was opened by elizabeth bowes-lyon exactly a month later , and her involvement caught the public 's imagination although the upper avon was in a much worse condition than the lower avon , the upper avon navigation trust ltd ( uant ) was constituted in 1965 to rebuild it negotiation with the severn river authority led to an agreement that such works could be constructed , which was eventually formalised when a private bill was put before parliament , which became the upper avon navigation act 1972 this was first considered by the severn trent water authority in 1974 , who conducted a survey , the cost of which was partly funded by the inland waterways association landowners at warwick castle and charlecote park have attempted to claim the river as private property , although the 1636 order of council state that the river was free to coventry commercial traffic returned to the avon in may 2010 , as part of a scheme to build flood defences at the town of pershore , following flooding in 2007 , which caused damage to a number of properties
