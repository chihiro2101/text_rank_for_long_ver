when there is a question regarding handcuffing a person then at that time case laws has stated that the choice to handcuff a person is dependent on the surrounding circumstances , and that officers should always take the proper precautions to ensure the safety of themselves , and the public when there exists probable cause to believe that a person has committed a minor crime , such as petty theft , driving on a suspended license , or disturbing the peace , law enforcement agents typically issue the individual a citation but do not otherwise detain them also , in certain states , the prosecution has 48 hours to decide whether or not to file formal charges against the accused for example , in california , if no formal charges are filed within the 48-hour period , the accused must be released from the arresting host 's custody arrestees in northern ireland have the right to contact a person to inform them of an arrest , and legal representation there are four subcategories of arrest without warrant : powers of the police in england and wales criminal offences ( pace ) , which only applies to constables , citizens arrest england and wales , applies to those who are not constables , the power to arrest for a breach of the peace at common law , which applies to everyone ( constable or not and includes a power of entry ) , and the powers to arrest otherwise than for an offence , which apply to constables only for example , an arrest warrant may be issued if an accused person does not appear in court when he is due to answer a charge however , an arrest warrant is not always necessary it is not necessary that the officer knows the exact statutory provision that the suspect has violated , so long as the officer reasonably suspects that the suspect has done something amounting to an offence in the united kingdom , a person must be told that they are under arrest in simple , non-technical language , the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest a person must be 'cautioned ' when being arrested or subject to a criminal prosecution procedure , unless this is impractical due to the behaviour of the arrested person arizona , after making an arrest , the police must inform the detainee of their fifth amendment and sixth amendment rights in order for statements made during questioning to be admissible as evidence against the detainee in court an officer is also not necessarily required to provide a miranda warning if the person they are questioning has not been arrested or if a person they have arrested speaks spontaneously without being questioned there is also an exception that permits questioning without providing the warning under circumstances involving urgent matters of public safety since the exact wording used in an arrest is legally important , police officers often carry a printed copy of the rights with them and read from it when providing the warning to ensure accuracy they may choose whether or not to answer any questions posed by the police ( except that they may need to provide their name and address to the police ) breach of a court order can be considered civil contempt of court , and a warrant for the person 's arrest may be issued some court orders contain authority for a police officer to make an arrest without further order for convictions , the collateral consequences are more severe in the united states than in the uk , where arrests without conviction do not appear in standard criminal record checks and need not be disclosed , whereas in the united states , people have to expunge or ( if the case goes to court ) seal arrest without convictions , or if the charges are dropped
