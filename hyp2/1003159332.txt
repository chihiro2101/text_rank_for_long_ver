from 1768 there were a number of grand schemes proposed , all with the aim of linking the bristol channel to the english channel by a waterway , thereby avoiding the need to navigate by sea around cornwall and devon john rennie surveyed the line for a ship canal from the mouth of the river parrett to seaton in 1810 , which was designed for ships of , but it was felt that the economic situation would not support the projected expenditure of over £1 & nbsp ; million thomas telford revived the idea of a ship canal in 1824 , which would have taken over the line of the bridgwater and taunton canal – enabling boats to reach the south coast – at a cost of £1.75 million finally , a barge canal between bridgwater and beer , costing £600,000 , was proposed in 1828 , but enthusiasm for large canal schemes was waning , and the advent of iron-hulled steamships meant that the risks of navigation around the south-west peninsula were reduced construction of the canal began in 1822 , with james hollinsworth as the engineer and john easton obtaining an injunction , and work on the lower half of the canal stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 act the lock at firepool ( taunton ) had a set of reverse-facing gates , to prevent the canal draining if the level of the river tone dropped one final lock connected the basin to the river , and again it had a set of reverse-facing gates , so that the basin could be drained at low tide , and the low level retained for maintenance if required the conservators promptly built a dam , to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal , which they removed after further legal action and an order of the chancery court this was obtained in july 1832 , and required the canal company to erect a new iron bridge to replace the existing north town bridge , which hampered access to the wharfs in taunton they also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at french weir , to connect with the grand western canal , while the conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal , and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order subsequently the canal company , in order to protect their trade , sought their own act to construct a floating harbour to the west of bridgwater , and to extend the canal to join it the canal company had hoped that the opening of the grand western canal in 1838 and the chard canal in 1842 would increase traffic significantly , but their impact was marginal the main attraction was the dock , with its large volume of coal traffic , but they purchased both the canal and the dock for £64,000 , under the terms of an act of parliament obtained that year , which included a requirement that there should always be '' a good and sufficient water communication between the towns of taunton and bridgwater '' unlike many such acquisitions , the canal was seen as a useful adjunct to the railway network , and was maintained in good order for several years , with the conservators of the river tone continuing their annual inspections , and reporting any defects to the railway company the main source of water was the river tone , although this was not fed into the canal at firepool , in order to ensure that the mills on the upper section could function the canal gradually became clogged with weed , and the railway took much of the trade the new owners were remote , and were more interested in the water supply for taunton station and for the bridgwater dock , than running the canal as a going concern , with the result that the canal deteriorated further the opening by the great western railway of the severn tunnel in 1886 brought further decline , for the imports of coal and slate from south wales to bridgwater dock and the canal could now be moved more directly the provision in 1902 of water troughs on the railway near creech , to enable non-stop trains to pick up water , required another a day , which was extracted from the tone image : pillbox and engine house.jpg thumb left a pillbox which formed part of the taunton stop line , with creech engine house , charlton , in the background after the world war i the canal remained in a state of limbo – with minimal maintenance by the railway company – and was the haunt of fishermen and walkers the inland waterways association started to take an active interest in the restoration of the canal from 1952 , but this was resisted by the british transport commission , who padlocked the lock gates to prevent them being used the maintenance of the channel enabled the canal to become one of the first to be used for the water transportation , which was pumped from the canal to durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards soon afterwards , part of the cutting wall between west street and albert street collapsed , and although the bed of the canal was cleared to ensure water could reach the dock , the towpath remained blocked for another nine years bridgwater docks , which had been used by a small amount of coastal shipping , were finally closed in 1971 : the connection at the docks was stopped up , and the british waterways board were granted permission to cease maintaining the canal for navigation the inland waterways association produced a report , entitled the bridgwater and taunton canal - waterway with a future , suggesting that the canal had the potential for development as a linear country park , and the county planning officer for somerset county council produced a second report , suggesting that funds should be made available for maintenance and restoration , which the county council duly adopted
