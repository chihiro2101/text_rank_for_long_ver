there are three main types of contemporary metal handcuffs : chain ( cuffs are held together by a short chain ) , hinged ( since hinged handcuffs permit less movement than a chain cuff , they are generally considered to be more secure ) , and rigid solid bar handcuffs in 1933 the royal canadian mounted police used a type called '' mitten handcuffs '' to prevent criminals from being able to grab an object like the officer 's gun sometimes two pairs of handcuffs are needed to restrain a person with an exceptionally large waistline because the hands can not be brought close enough together ; in this case , one cuff on one pair of handcuffs is handcuffed to one of the cuffs on the other pair , and then the remaining open handcuff on each pair is applied to the person 's wrists these include 't'-type 'come along ' , 'd'-type and 'figure-8 ' handcuffs in recent years , airlines have begun to carry plastic handcuffs as a way to restrain disruptive passengers however , aforementioned usage means that cheap handcuffs are available in situations where steel ones would normally lie unused for long times recent products have been introduced that serve to address this concern , including disposable plastic restraints that can be opened or loosened with a key ; more expensive than conventional plastic restraints , they can only be used a very limited number of times , and are not as strong as conventional disposable restraints , let alone modern metal handcuffs on occasions when a suspect exhibits extremely aggressive behavior , fetters may be used in addition to handcuffs ; sometimes the chain connecting the leg irons to one another is looped around the chain of the handcuffs , and then the leg irons are applied , resulting in the person being '' hogtie '' when being placed in standard legcuffs , the prisoner will still have the possibility to manage normal steps and can therefore walk independently , but is prevented from running such a long term use of leg shackles may soon result in pressure marks on the prisoner 's ankles and will cause serious harm when the handcuffs are concealed by a handcuff cover and secured at the prisoner 's waist by a belly chain , this combination will result in a rather more severe restraint and the restrained person may feel discomfort or even pain to prevent the restrained person from eventually opening the handcuffs with a handcuff key , a handcuff cover may be used to conceal the keyholes of the handcuffs the vast majority of police academies in the united states today also teach their recruits to apply handcuffs so that the palms of the suspect 's hands face outward after the handcuffs are applied suspects are handcuffed with the keyholes facing up ( away from the hands ) to make it difficult to open them even with a key or improvised lock-pick the risk of the prisoner losing balance is higher if the hands are handcuffed behind the back than if they are handcuffed in front ; however , the risk of using fisted hands together as a weapon increases with hands in front there are several ways of escaping from handcuffs : slipping hands out when the hands are smaller than the wrist lock picking releasing the pawl with a shim opening the handcuffs with a duplicate key , often hidden on the body of the performer before the performance it is also technically possible to break free from handcuffs by applying massive amounts of force from one 's arms to cause the device to split apart or loosen enough to squeeze one 's hands through ; however , this takes exceptional strength ( especially with handcuffs made of steel ) another common method of escaping ( or attempting to escape ) from being handcuffed behind the back , is that one would , from a sitting or lying position , bring one 's legs up as high upon one 's torso as possible , then push one 's arms down to bring the handcuffs below one 's feet , finally pulling the handcuffs up using one 's arms to the front of one 's body these maneuvers , and the reverse ( otherwise impossible ) maneuver of bringing the handcuffed hands up behind the back and forwards over the head and then down in front , can be done fairly easily by some people who were born without collarbones because of the inherited deformity called cleidocranial dysostosis from this position , one has a better chance of attempting to use a tool ( such as a shim or lockpick ) to work one 's way out of the handcuffs they were designed using the same model of soft restraints used on psychiatric patients because they can be worn for long periods of time uses are : by police , to mean '' allow yourself to be handcuffed
