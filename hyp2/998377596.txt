the first full edition of this bible , with a further revised new testament , appeared in 1560 , but it was not printed in england until 1575 ( new testament ) and 1576 ( complete bible ) the annotations which are an important part of the geneva bible were calvinism and puritan in character , and as such they were disliked by the ruling pro-government anglicans of the church of england , as well as king james i , who commissioned the '' authorized version '' , or king james bible , in order to replace it the geneva bible had also motivated the earlier production of the bishops ' bible under elizabeth i , for the same reason , and the later rheims-douai edition by the recusancy the geneva notes were surprisingly included in a few editions of the king james version , even as late as 1715 300 and see the wikipedia article for david daniell however , the geneva bible was the first english version in which all of the old testament was translated directly from the hebrew ( cf the geneva bible was the first english bible to use verse numbers based on the work of stephanus ( robert estienne of paris , by this point living in geneva ) of the various later english bible translations , the next to use roman type was the douay-rheims bible of 1582 ( new testament ) and 1609â€“10 ( old testament ) geneva bibles with the '' breeches '' passage continued to be printed well into the time of the king james bible of 1611 . the original cross references were retained as well as the study notes by the reformation leaders examination of the differences shows that the earlier geneva version is often more direct and modern in style than the later king james , e.g as can be seen by the text below , daniel chapter 4 in the geneva bible appears to have removed two verses in reality , the geneva bible places those two verses at the end of chapter 3 , as the hebrew , greek , and latin versions all did so when towards the end of the conference two puritans suggested that a new translation of the bible be produced to unify better the anglican church in england and scotland , james embraced the idea he commissioned and chartered a new translation of the bible which would eventually become the most famous version of the bible in the history of the english language officially known as the authorized version to be read in churches , the new bible would come to bear his name as the so-called king james bible or king james version ( kjv ) elsewhere or casually the first and early editions of the king james bible from 1611 and the first few decades thereafter lack annotations , unlike nearly all editions of the geneva bible up until that time
