unlike e2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole please copy your good encyclopedic content from e2 to wikipedia ! do n't forget to search for related wikipedia content first & mdash ; like e2 , wikipedia has full-text search , and if wikipedia already has an article on the subject , just merge your own content into it : be bold ! mention on the wikipedia article 's talk page ( click '' discuss this page '' ) that you originally wrote the material for e2 and link to your e2 homenode ( like this : yerricde ) , so that nobody thinks you 're committing plagiarism do n't forget to add links from other articles to yours , where it 's appropriate ; wikipedia has no '' soft link '' functionality on the other hand , e2 articles tend to be somewhat more heavily linked , and e2 noders often put links around phrases to emphasize them wikipedia articles usually try to cover a subject in depth instead of concentrating on a single aspect thereof what may be a perfectly acceptable write-up on e2 may well be a stub on wikipedia that can only be fixed by merging it into a larger article similarly , an article should at any time look like an encyclopedia text , even if it is only a very short one but always keep in mind that wikipedia is an encyclopedia & mdash ; if you want to keep an online diary or write down your personal opinions , e2 and other wikis are probably a better place whatever wikipedia 's policies for disseminating its content may be , e2 discourages the posting of material not substantially authored by the user posting it ( regardless of the impression that a perusal of some of e2 's older content may give ) e2 does not have formal policy , but one popular view holds that a writeup without attribution to another source carries an implicit claim that the user who posted the writeup is its author at some point in the past , a few users created the everyone e2 account to upload content without taking personal credit for it the everyone account still exists on e2 and may occasionally be useful for adding wikipedia content , especially if it is content you are not substantially responsible for the user who wishes to move wikipedia content to e2 has three other alternatives : 1 if you are an e2 user who is a member of such a usergroup , you may be able to convince the group to allow you to copy wikipedia material to that account create a new account and post a clear claim on its homenode that it is used to post content not authored by its owner
