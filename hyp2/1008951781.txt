she returned to england that year , continuing to work as an illustrator , and branching out into theatrical design for a miniature theatre in london , she was taken under the wing of the lyceum theatre group led by ellen terry ( who is said to have given her the nickname 'pixie ' ) , henry irving , and bram stoker and traveled with them around the country , working on costumes and stage design in 1901 , she established a studio in london and held a weekly open house for artists , authors , actors , and others involved with the arts arthur ransome , then in his early 20s , describes one of these '' at home '' evenings , and the curious artistic circle around smith , in his 1907 bohemia in london additionally , smith donated her services for more poster designs and toys to the red cross during world war i in 1907 , alfred stieglitz gave smith an exhibition of paintings in new york at his little galleries of the photo-secession ( also known as gallery 291 ) , making smith the first painter to have a show at what had been until then a gallery devoted exclusively to the photographic avant-garde in 1909 , waite commissioned smith to produce a tarot deck with appeal to the world of art , and the result was the unique waite-smith tarot deck apart from book illustration projects and the tarot deck , her art found little in the way of commercial outlets after her early success with stieglitz in new york several examples of her works done in gouache were collected by her cousin , the american sherlock holmes actor william gillette , and may be found today prominently displayed in his castle in connecticut after the end of the first world war , smith received an inheritance from an uncle that enabled her to lease a house on the lizard peninsula in cornwall , an area popular with artists although she continued writing and illustrating , she was unable to find publishers for her work , likely due to changes in public taste following the first world war when smith 's tarot was first published by rider , in england , in december 1909 , it was simply called tarot cards and it was accompanied by arthur edward waite 's guide entitled the key to the tarot the following year waite added smith 's black-and-white drawings to the book and published it as the pictorial key to the tarot in the century since the deck 's first printing , there have been dozens of editions put out by various publishers ; for some of these the smith drawings were redrawn by other artists , and for others the cards were rephotographed to create new printing plates this is how illustrators often work , and as a commercial illustrator , smith would probably have been comfortable with such a working process smith and waite drew on a number of sources as inspirations for the deck 's designs in particular , it appears that waite took his inspiration for the trumps mainly from the french tarot of marseilles ( although the oldest date from the 16th century , his model was possibly a marseilles deck from the 18th century ) this is a short period of time for an artist to complete some 80 pictures ( the number claimed by smith in a letter to stieglitz in 1909 and corresponding almost exactly to the standard 78-card tarot deck ) the exhibition included works by smith and other women artists who were active in the art and photography scene prior to o'keeffe their works help to put o'keeffe 's art in the context of the time
