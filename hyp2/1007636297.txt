some early microcomputer peripheral devices required the end user physically to cut some wires and solder together others in order to make configuration changes ; such changes were intended to be largely permanent for the life of the hardware the msx system , released in 1983 , was designed to be plug and play from the ground up , and achieved this by a system of slots and subslots , where each had its own virtual address space , thus eliminating device addressing conflicts in its very source in time , many industry standard architecture ( isa ) cards incorporated , through proprietary and varied techniques , hardware to self-configure or to provide for software configuration ; often , the card came with a configuration program on disk that could automatically set the software-configurable ( but not itself self-configuring ) hardware scott mueller , upgrading and repairing pcs , eleventh edition , que , 2999 , , page 1370 at the time , there could be a mix of devices in a system , some capable of automatic configuration , and some still using fully manual settings via jumpers and dip switches the old world of dos still lurked underneath windows 95 , and systems could be configured to load devices three different ways : through windows 95 device manager drivers only using dos drivers loaded in the config.sys and autoexec.bat configuration files using both dos drivers and windows 95 device manager drivers together microsoft could not assert full control over all device settings , so configuration files could include a mix of driver entries inserted by the windows 95 automatic configuration process , and could also include driver entries inserted or modified manually by the computer users themselves the windows 95 device manager also could offer users a choice of several semi-automatic configurations to try to free up resources for devices that still needed manual configuration also , although some later isa devices were capable of automatic configuration , it was common for pc isa expansion cards to limit themselves to a very small number of choices for interrupt request lines the hardware of pc computers additionally limited device expansion options because interrupts could not be shared , and some multifunction expansion cards would use multiple interrupts for different card functions , such as a dual-port serial card requiring a separate interrupt for each serial port until approximately 2000 , pc computers could still be purchased with a mix of isa and pci slots , so it was still possible that manual isa device configuration might be necessary several completely automated computer interfaces are currently used , each of which requires no device configuration or other action on the part of the computer user , apart from software installation , for the self-configuring devices although both firewire and usb have bandwidth that must be shared by all devices , most modern operating systems are unable to monitor and report the amount of bandwidth being used or available , or to identify which devices are currently using the interface .
