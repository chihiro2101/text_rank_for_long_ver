according to john symonds , writing in the encyclopædia britannica eleventh edition , manutius was granted citizenship of the town of carpi on 8 march 1480 where he owned local property , and in 1482 he traveled to mirandola for a time with his longtime friend and fellow student , giovanni pico della mirandola , where he stayed two years to study greek literature at the end of the 1480s , manutius published two works addressed to his two pupils and their mother , caterina pico—both works were published in venice by baptista de tortis : musarum panagyris with its epistola catherinae piae ( march/may 1487 to march 1491 ) and the paraenesis ( 1490 ) in venice , manutius began gathering publishing contracts , at which point he met andrea torresani , who was also engaged in print publishing torresani and manutius became lifelong business partners , and for their first contract together manutius hired torresani to print the first edition of his latin grammar book the institutiones grammaticae , published on 9 march 1493 manutius started the first volume of his aristotle edition in 1495 in addition to editing greek manuscripts , manutius corrected and improved texts originally published in florence , rome , and milan he published an edition of minor greek orators ( 1508 ) and the lesser works of plutarch ( 1509 ) manutius reappeared in 1513 with an edition of plato that he dedicated to pope leo x in a preface that compares the miseries of warfare and the woes of italy with the sublime and tranquil objects of the student 's life only four italian towns were authorized to produce greek publications : milan , venice , vicenza , and florence , and they only published works by theocritus , isocrates , and homer venice printer john speyer produced greek passages but required the minimal greek letters to be left blank and later filled in by hand to preserve ancient greek literature , the aldine press commissioned a typeface based on classical greek manuscripts so that readers could experience the original greek text more authentically the encyclopædia britannica eleventh edition writes that the new academy 's '' rules were written in greek , its members spoke greek , their names were hellenized , and their official titles were greek along with greek classics , the aldine press published latin and italian authors pietro bembo worked with manutius from 1501 to 1502 to provide an accurate edition of dante and petrarch and also introduced punctuation manutius did not hold the same power of innovation over latin classics as with greek classics because publication of these works started 30 years before his time manutius was on the lookout for rare manuscripts , but often found instead missing parts of previously published works cuspinianus let manutius publish the missing parts of valerius maximus 's work , which cuspinianus '' had found in a manuscript in vienna '' francesco negri let manutius publish the missing text of julius firmicus , which negri found in romania , and '' a manuscript from britain made an improved edition of prudentius possible manutius 's editions of the classics were so highly respected that the dolphin-and-anchor device was almost immediately pirated by french and italian publishers manutius described his new format of books as '' libelli portatiles in formam enchiridii '' ( '' portable small books in the form of a manual '' ) many scholars consider the development of the portable book as manutius 's most celebrated contribution to printing and publishing these mobile books were the first known appearance of an editio minor , a straightforward text manutius commissioned typefaces designed to look like the handwriting of humanists both in latin and greek in order to uphold the manuscript tradition other scholars believe the first greek typeface was derived from the handwriting of immanuel rhusotas , another scribe during the time of manutius the roman typeface was finished later the same year and pietro bembo 's de aetna was the first book published in the new roman script griffo 's original italic type did not include capital letters , so many of the aldine press publications forwent capital letters manutius acquired privileges for his printing press from the venetian senate , specifically , for '' his types , his pioneering octavo format , and even individual texts before the printing press and during the italian renaissance , illuminated manuscripts were individually created by a credited artist when print publishing became popular , woodcuts were used to mass-illuminate works these woodcuts soon came to venice and were viewed as part of the '' new humanist manuscript prefatory letters , popular in first editions of latin works years before , were also common for aldine editions a new , improved edition of horace ( after 30 march 1509 ) with an accompanying work by manutius on horatian metrics dedicated to carles was contingent on this experience and manutius 's connection with carles however , before his death manutius had begun an edition of the septuagint , also known as the greek old testament translated from hebrew , the first ever to be published ; it aldine bible the majority were greek classics , but many notable latin and italian works were published as well '' the quality and popularity of manutius 's work made it more expensive in the 20th century than others published around the same time manutius 's name is the inspiration for progetto manuzio , an italian free text project similar to project gutenberg partial list of latin editions published during his lifetime : astronomica , julius firmicus , october 1499 partial list of humanist authors translated and published by the aldine press under manutius 's supervision : instructional principles of latin grammar , aldus manutius ( 5 march 1493 ) gleanings in dialectics , lorenzo maioli ( july 1497 ) complete works , angelo poliziano ( july 1498 ) cornucopiae , niccolò perotti ( july 1499 ) rudiments of latin grammar , aldus manutius ( february–june 1501 ) on imagination , gianfrancesco pico ( april 1501 ) the land and customs of the zygians call circassians
