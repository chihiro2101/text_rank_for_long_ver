according to their august 2017 chart , a number of their engines are compatible with unleaded fuel however , all of their engines require that an oil additive be used when unleaded fuel is used : '' when using the unleaded fuels identified in table 1 , lycoming oil additive p/n lw-16702 , or an equivalent finished product such as aeroshell 15w-50 , must be used '' lycoming also notes that the octane rating of the fuel used must also meet the requirements stated in the fuel specification , otherwise engine damage may occur due to detonation the use of unleaded auto fuels with engines designed for leaded fuels can result in excessive exhaust valve seat wear due to the lack of lead with cylinder performance deteriorating to unacceptable levels in under 10 hours however , prices are so high that there have been efforts to convert to diesel fuel , which is more readily available , less expensive , and has advantages for aviation use the first number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to '' aviation lean '' standards , which is similar to the anti-knock index or '' pump rating '' given to automotive gasoline in the us the second number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to the '' aviation rich '' standard , which tries to simulate a supercharged condition with a rich mixture , elevated temperatures , and a high manifold pressure the 100ll phase-out has been called '' one of modern ga 's most pressing problems '' , because 70 % of 100ll aviation fuel is used by the 30 % of the aircraft in the general aviation fleet that can not use any of the existing alternatives in february 2008 , teledyne continental motors ( tcm ) announced that the company is very concerned about future availability of 100ll , and as a result , they would develop a line of diesel engines in a february 2008 interview , tcm president rhett ross indicated belief that the aviation industry will be '' forced out '' of using 100ll in the near future , leaving automotive fuel and jet fuel as the only alternatives by may 2012 , the us federal aviation administration ( faa unleaded avgas transition rulemaking committee ) had put together a plan in conjunction with industry to replace leaded avgas with an unleaded alternative within 11 years the lycoming position is supported by aircraft type clubs representing owners of aircraft that would be unable to run on lower octane fuel since may 2016 , ul94 , now a product of swift fuels , is available for sale at dozens of us airports '' in august 2016 , the faa revised saib hq-16-05 to include similar wording regarding the acceptability of using ul94 in aircraft and engines that are approved to operate with avgas that has a minimum motor octane rating of 80 or lower , including grade 80/87 the publication of the saib , especially the august 2016 revision , eliminated the need for many of the ul94 stcs being sold by swift fuels , as the majority of the aircraft on the stc 's approved model list are type-certified to use 80-octane or lower avgas composed of approximately 85 % mesitylene and 15 % isopentane , the fuel is reportedly scheduled for extensive testing by the faa to receive certification under the new astm d7719 guideline for unleaded 100ll replacement fuels swift fuels suggests that the fuel , formerly referred to as 100sf , will be available for '' high performance piston-powered aircraft '' before 2020 john and mary-louise rusek founded swift enterprises in 2001 to develop renewable fuels and hydrogen fuel cells over the next several years , the company sought to build a pilot plant to produce enough fuel for larger-scale testing and submitted fuel to the faa for testing the faa found swift fuel to have a motor octane number of 104.4 , 96.3 % of the energy per unit of mass , and 113 % of the energy per unit of volume as 100ll , and to meet most of the astm d910 standard for leaded aviation fuel following tests in two lycoming engines , the faa concluded it performs better than 100ll in detonation testing and will provide a fuel saving of 8 % per unit of volume , though it weighs more than 100ll gc–fid testing showed the fuel to be made primarily of two components — one about 85 % by weight and the other about 14 % by weight soon afterward , avweb reported that continental had begun the process of certifying several of its engines to use the new fuel by november 2013 , the company had built its pilot plant and received approval to produce fuel in it the production economics of this new fuel have not been confirmed but it is anticipated that it will cost at least as much as 100ll in december 2013 shell oil announced that they had developed an unleaded 100 octane fuel and will submit it for faa testing with certification expected within two to three years under a federal court order to set a new standard by october 15 , 2008 , the epa cut the acceptable limits for atmospheric lead from the previous standard of 1.5 & nbsp ; µg/m 3 to 0.15 & nbsp ; µg/m 3 the epa indicated : '' this action will describe the lead inventory related to use of leaded avgas , air quality and exposure information , additional information the agency is collecting related to the impact of lead emissions from piston-engine aircraft on air quality and will request comments on this information fifteen of 17 airports monitored during a year-long study in the us by the epa have lead emissions well below the current national ambient air quality standard ( naaqs ) for lead
