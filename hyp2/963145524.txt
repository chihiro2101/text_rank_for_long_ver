the world 's first adhesive postage stamp was called the penny black many early stamps were not gummed , however , and some have been unable to be gummed due to shortage ( for instance , the typewritten uganda cowry stamps of 1895 ) some stamps , intended only for sale to stamp collectors , have been issued without gum , for instance the united states farley 's follies souvenir sheets of 1933 on the first stamps of great britain the gum was called cement williams , l.n originally , gumming took place after printing and before perforation , usually because the paper had to be damp for printing to work well , but in modern times most stamp printing is done dry on pre-gummed paper in recent years , the use of self-adhesive stamps , otherwise known as pressure-sensitive stamps , has become widespread this relatively new form of stamps has a smooth waxed or polymer-coated release carrier backing to which the pressure-adhesive adhesive of the stamp does not adhere as strongly as on paper '' the authors added the warning that '' postage stamps are often handled very carelessly when issued over the counter , and yet the purchaser will usually lick them without hesitation stamp gum is an item of importance for collectors , although its presence is rarely of use in differentiating between common and rare stamps , and being on the back of the stamp it is not usually visible generally , the following conditions are distinguished : mint : stamps with full , undamaged original gum , as sold by the post office some stamps have been issued without any gum at all , either due to a lack of materials , or ( in particular in tropical countries ) to avoid the risk of stamp sheets sticking together traditionally , in particular before world war ii , stamps were mounted in albums with stamp hinges no matter whether they were used or unused this means that old unused stamps in supposedly mint condition often come under suspicion of having been regummed , and the detection of regummed stamps is an important part of philatelic expertisation there was an official notice that stated that stamps were going to be prepared with 'hard ' gum , and were intended for use in the summer or humid season to prevent the premature sticking together of the stamps , or the sticking to the paraffin paper when in book form stamps printed on the gummed side by mistake are sought after by collectors with an interest in uncommon varieties the gum of older stamp issues often causes the unused stamps to roll care must be taken during production that stamp gum , in particular if prepared from natural materials , does not contain an excess of acid the latter can destroy the stamp paper over time such breaks can also affect the stamp paper and cause the stamps to disintegrate
