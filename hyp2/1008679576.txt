these formed the basis of the manchester ship canal railway , which became the largest private railway in the united kingdom to bring in construction materials , the construction railway had a connection to the cheshire lines committee east of irlam railway station all existing railway companies with lines along the route had been given notice that their lines had to either be abandoned by a given date or raised to give a minimum of clearance with all deviation construction costs to be paid by the msc when expensive repairs to the viaduct were needed in the early 1980s british rail opted to close it , together with the line to glazebrook at the end of construction , the canal company left in place the original construction railway route , and eventually developed track along of the canal 's length , mainly to its north bank manchester ship canal railway - detroit bridge , salford , heritage locations the only major deviation was to allow construction of the cws irlam soap works and the adjacent partington steel & iron co works at partington ( both of which had their own private railways and locomotives ) , with the msc railway 's deviation route pushed south to run alongside the canal 's north bank and under the irlam viaduct the canal company also developed large complexes of sidings along the route , built to service freight to and from the canal 's docks and nearby industrial estates , especially at : salford docks ; trafford park ; partington north coaling basin ( both sides of the canal ) ; glazebrook sidings ; and a small but busy marshalling yard east of irlam locks the msc railway was able to receive and despatch goods trains to and from all the uk 's mainline railway systems , using connecting junctions at three points in the terminal docks the third was to the south , operated by the cheshire lines committee ( clc ) , whereby the msc railway had taken over the old and abandoned route of the clc , giving them a monopoly on traffic to the new soap works and steel mill the through-line was officially closed to all traffic in 1978 , but many of the sidings complexes remained ; the last operational section of the msc railway , at trafford park , closed on 30 april 2009 matters have improved since 1990 when the national rivers authority found the area between trafford road bridge and mode wheel locks to be '' grossly polluted ''
