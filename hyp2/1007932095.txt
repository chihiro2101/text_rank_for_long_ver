in the united states , particularly in relation to applications to the supreme court of the united states for review of a lower court decision in roman law , certiorari was suggested in terms of reviewing a case—much as the term is applied today—although the term was also used in writing to indicate the need or duty to inform other parties of a court 's ruling in england and wales , and separately in ireland and later northern ireland , the court of king 's bench was tasked with the duty of supervising all lower courts , and had power to issue all writs necessary for the discharge of that duty ; the justices of that court appeared to have no discretion as to whether it was heard , as long as an application for a bill of certiorari met established criteria , as it arose from their duty of supervision in the courts of england and wales , the remedy of certiorari evolved into a general remedy for the correction of plain error , to bring decisions of an inferior court or tribunal or public authority before the superior court for review so that the court can determine whether to quash such decisions explains : in the united states , certiorari is most often seen as the writ that the supreme court of the united states issues to a lower court to review the lower court 's judgment for legal error ( reversible error ) and review where no appeal is available as a matter of right the cases that could reach the supreme court were heard as a matter of right , meaning that the court was required to issue a decision in each of those cases the act solved these problems by transferring most of the court 's direct appeals to the newly created circuit courts of appeals , whose decisions in those cases would normally be final 662 ( 1988 ) most cases can not be appealed to the supreme court of the united states as a matter of right the court denies the vast majority of petitions and thus leaves the decision of the lower court to stand without review ; it takes roughly 80 to 150 cases each term while both appeals of right and cert petitions often present several alleged errors of the lower courts for appellate review , the court normally grants review of only one or two questions presented in a certiorari petition the supreme court sometimes grants a writ of certiorari to resolve a '' circuit split '' , when the federal appeals courts in two ( or more ) federal judicial circuits have ruled differently in similar situations state court systems use the same terminology , but in others , writ of review , leave to appeal , or certification for appeal is used in place of writ of certiorari as the name for discretionary review of a lower court 's judgment a handful of states lack intermediate appellate courts ; in most of these , their supreme courts operate under a mandatory review regime , in which the supreme court must take all appeals in order to preserve the loser 's traditional right to one appeal ( except in criminal cases where the defendant was acquitted ) in two states without an intermediate appeals court—new hampshire and west virginia—the supreme court used to operate under discretionary review in all cases , whether civil or criminal in march 1927 , the texas legislature enacted a law directing the texas supreme court to summarily refuse to hear applications for writs of error when it believed the court of appeals opinion correctly stated the law thus , since june 1927 , over 4,100 decisions of the texas courts of appeals have become valid binding precedent of the texas supreme court itself because the high court refused applications for writ of error rather than denying them and thereby signaled that it approved of their holdings as the law of the state while texas ' unique practice saved the state supreme court from having to hear relatively minor cases just to create uniform statewide precedents on those issues , it also makes for lengthy citations to the opinions of the courts of appeals , since the subsequent writ history of the case must always be noted ( e.g ) in order for the reader to determine at a glance whether the cited opinion is binding precedent only in the district of the court of appeals in which it was decided , or binding precedent for the entire state solved the problem of creating uniform precedent by simply holding that the first intermediate appellate court to reach a novel question of law always sets binding precedent for the entire state , unless and until another intermediate appellate court expressly disagrees with the first one in the administrative law context , the common law writ of certiorari was historically used by lower courts in the united states for judicial review of decisions made by an administrative agency after an adversarial hearing in the federal courts , this use of certiorari has been abolished and replaced by a civil action under the administrative procedure act in a united states district court or in some circumstances a petition for review in a united states court of appeals
