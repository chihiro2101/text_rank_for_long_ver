opteron combines two important capabilities in a single processor : native execution of legacy x86 32-bit applications without speed penalties native execution of x86-64 64-bit applications the first capability is notable because at the time of opteron 's introduction , the only other 64-bit architecture marketed with 32-bit x86 compatibility ( intel 's itanium ) ran x86 legacy-applications only with significant speed degradation the opteron cpu directly supports up to an 8-way configuration , which can be found in mid-level servers in a variety of computing benchmarks , the opteron architecture has demonstrated better multi-processor scaling than the intel xeon which did n't have a point to point system until qpi and integrated memory controllers with the nehalem design in particular , the opteron 's integrated memory controller allows the cpu to access local ram very quickly in contrast , multiprocessor xeon system cpus share only two common buses for both processor-processor and processor-memory communication at the time , amd 's use of the term multi-core in practice meant dual-core ; each physical opteron chip contained two processor cores this effectively doubled the computing performance available to each motherboard processor socket at the time of its introduction , amd 's fastest multicore opteron was the model 875 , with two cores running at 2.2 ghz each amd 's fastest single-core opteron at this time was the model 252 , with one core running at 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz earlier dual core ddr2 based platforms were upgradeable to quad core chips opteron 4000 series cpus on socket c32 ( released july 2010 ) are dual-socket capable and are targeted at uniprocessor and dual-processor uses the opteron 6000 series cpus on socket g34 are quad-socket capable and are targeted at high-end dual-processor and quad-processor applications except for the fact they have 1 mb l2 cache ( versus 512 kb for the athlon64 ) the socket 939 opterons are identical to the san diego and toledo core athlon 64s , but are run at lower clock speeds than the cores are capable of , making them more stable amd introduced three quad-core opterons on socket am2+ for single-cpu servers in 2007 amd introduced three quad-core opterons on socket am3 for single-cpu servers in 2009 physically the socket and processor package are nearly identical , although not generally compatible with socket 1207 fx for socket f and socket am2 opterons , each chip has a four-digit model number , in the form opteron xzyy for all first , second , and third-generation opterons , the first digit ( the x ) specifies the number of cpus on the target machine : 1 – designed for uniprocessor systems 2 – designed for dual-processor systems 8 – designed for systems with 4 or 8 processors for socket f and socket am2 opterons , the second digit ( the z ) represents the processor generation the first digit refers to the number of cpus in the target machine : 4 – designed for uniprocessor and dual-processor systems
