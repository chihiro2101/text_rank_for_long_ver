for a while , clay was used to shape some of the soft parts , but this made specimens heavy more sophisticated cotton-wrapped wire bodies supporting sewn-on cured skins soon followed they generated much interest among the public and scientists alike who considered them as superior to earlier models and were regarded as the first lifelike and artistic specimens on display additional modern uses of taxidermy have been the use of '' faux taxidermy '' or fake animal heads that draw on the inspiration of traditional taxidermy '' rogue taxidermy '' describes a wide variety of work , including work that is classified and exhibited as fine art the genre was born from forms of fine art that utilize some of the components found in the construction of a traditional taxidermy mount '' the definition of rogue taxidermy set forth by the individuals who formed the genre ( brewer , bibus , and marbury ) is : '' a genre of pop-surrealist art characterized by mixed media sculptures containing conventional taxidermy-related materials that are used in an unconventional manner '' apart from describing a genre of fine art , the term '' rogue taxidermy '' has expanded in recent years and has also become an adjective applied to unorthodox forms of traditional taxidermy such as anthropomorphic mounts and composite mounts where two or more animals are spliced together the animal is first skinned in a process similar to removing the skin from a chicken prior to cooking modeling clay can be used to reform features as well , if the appendage was torn or damaged clay can hold it together and add muscle detail mounting an animal has long been considered an art form , often involving months of work ; not all modern taxidermists trap or hunt for prized specimens a traditional method that remains popular today involves retaining the original skull and leg bones of a specimen and using these as the basis to create a mannequin made primarily from wood wool ( previously tow or hemp wool was used ) and galvanised wire another method is to mould the carcass in plaster , and then make a copy of the animal using one of several methods the carcass is then removed and the mould is used to produce a cast of the animal called a 'form ' forms can also be made by sculpting the animal first in clay ( the skeleton and all accompanying musculature is still beneath the surface of the skin ) the animal is positioned into the desired pose , then placed into the chamber of a special freeze drying machine designed specifically for this application this is because it is the least invasive in terms of what is done to the animal 's body after death , which is a concern of owners ( most owners do not opt for a traditional skin mount ) in the case of large pets , such as dogs and cats , freeze drying is also the best way to capture the animal 's expression as it looked in life ( another important concern of owners ) the process is also time-consuming ; therefore , freeze drying is generally an expensive method to preserve an animal some methods of creating a trophy mount do not involve preserving the actual body of the animal instead , detailed photos and measurements are taken of the animal so a taxidermist can create an exact replica in resin or fiberglass that can be displayed in place of the real animal while the animal is unconscious , the hunter poses for photos with the animal while it is measured for the purpose of creating a replica , or to establish what size of prefabricated fiberglass trophy head can be purchased to most closely approximate the actual animal a study skin is a taxidermic zoological specimen prepared in a minimalistic fashion that is concerned only with preserving the animal 's skin , not the shape of the animal 's body a study skin 's sole purpose is to preserve data , not to replicate an animal in a lifelike state museums keep large collections of study skins in order to conduct comparisons of physical characteristics to other study skins of the same species study skins are dried in these positions to keep the end product as slender and streamlined as possible so large numbers of specimens can be stored side-by-side in flat file drawers , while occupying a minimum amount of space since study skins are not prepared with aesthetics in mind they do not have imitation eyes like other taxidermy , and their cotton filling is visible in their eye openings
