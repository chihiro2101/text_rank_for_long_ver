in 1698 , the english mechanical designer thomas savery invented a pumping appliance that used steam to draw water directly from a well by means of a vacuum created by condensing steam the solution to draining deep mines was found by thomas newcomen who developed an '' atmospheric '' engine that also worked on the vacuum principle it employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to one end of a rocking beam that worked a mechanical lift pump from its opposite end in the next fifty years only a few small changes were made to the engine design each charge of steam introduced would continue condensing until the cylinder approached working temperature once again because the condenser and the working cylinder were separate , condensation occurred without significant loss of heat from the cylinder the steam supply was cut during the stroke , and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side this increased the efficiency of the engine , but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications , in particular pumping watt did not use high pressure steam because of safety concerns as fully developed , it used about 75 % less fuel than a similar newcomen one watt had tried unsuccessfully for several years to obtain an accurately bored cylinder for his steam engines , and was forced to use hammered iron , which was out of round and caused leakage past the piston in 1774 , john wilkinson invented a boring machine in which the shaft that held the cutting tool was supported on both ends and extended through the cylinder , unlike the cantilevered borers then in use the first watt engines were atmospheric pressure engines , like the newcomen engine but with the condensation taking place separate from the cylinder driving the engines using both low pressure steam and a partial vacuum raised the possibility of reciprocating engine development before the development of the double acting piston , the linkage to the beam and the piston rod had been by means of a chain , which meant that power could only be applied in one direction , by pulling this was effective in engines that were used for pumping water , but the double action of the piston meant that it could push as well as pull this masterpiece of engineering uses a four bar linkage coupled with a pantograph to produce the required straight line motion much more cheaply than if he had used a slider type of linkage having the beam connected to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant that it was possible to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel because factory machinery needed to operate at a constant speed , watt linked a steam regulator valve to a centrifugal governor which he adapted from those used to automatically control the speed of windmills these improvements allowed the steam engine to replace the water wheel and horses as the main sources of power for british industry , thereby freeing it from geographical constraints and becoming one of the main drivers in the industrial revolution watt was also concerned with fundamental research on the functioning of the steam engine his most notable measuring device , still in use today , is the watt indicator incorporating a manometer to measure steam pressure within the cylinder according to the position of the piston , enabling a diagram to be produced representing the pressure of the steam as a function of its volume throughout the cycle the oldest still in its original engine house and still capable of doing the job for which it was installed is the 1812 boulton and watt engine at the crofton pumping station this was used to pump water for the kennet and avon canal ; on certain weekends throughout the year the modern pumps are switched off and the two steam engines at crofton still perform this function it has been argued that this was probably the last commercial atmospheric engine to be manufactured researchers from the university of southampton / uk are currently developing a modern version of watt 's engine in order to generate energy from waste steam and waste heat the engine incorporates steam expansion as well as new features such as electronic control
