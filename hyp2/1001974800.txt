starting on november 5 , 1958 , langley research center engineers under robert gilruth directed project mercury and follow-on crewed space programs the stg originally reported to the goddard space flight center organization , with a total staff of 45 , including 37 engineers , and eight secretaries and human computer ( women who ran calculations on mechanical adding machines ) in 1959 , the center added 32 canadian engineers put out of work by the cancellation of the avro canada cf-105 arrow project kennedy set the goal to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade , it became clear gilruth would need a larger organization to lead the apollo program , with new test facilities and research laboratories before a decision could be made , however , the air force decided not to close macdill , omitting it from consideration and moving the rice university site to first place webb informed president kennedy on september 14 of the decision made by him and deputy administrator hugh dryden in two separate memoranda , one reviewing the criteria and procedures , and the other stating : '' our decision is that this laboratory should be located in houston , texas , in close association with rice university and the other educational institutions there and in that region immediately after webb 's announcement , gilruth and his staff began planning the move from langley to houston , using what would grow to of leased office and laboratory space in 11 scattered sites construction of the center , designed by charles luckman , began in april 1962 , and gilruth 's new organization was formed and moved to the temporary locations by september the speech is famous for highlighting the apollo program , but kennedy also made reference to the new center : the facility was officially opened for business in september 1963 in 1961 , as plans for project gemini began , it became increasingly clear that the mercury control center located at the cape canaveral air force station launch center would become inadequate to control missions with maneuverable spacecraft such as gemini and apollo christopher kraft and three other flight controllers began studying what was needed for an improved control center , and directed a study contract awarded to philco 's western development laboratory philco bid on and won the contract to build the electronic equipment for the new mission control center , which would be located in building 30 of msc rather than canaveral or the goddard space flight center in maryland the new center had two mission operations control rooms , allowing training and preparation for a later mission to be carried out while a live mission is in progress it was brought online for testing purposes during the uncrewed gemini 2 flight in january 1965 and the first crewed gemini flight , gemini 3 in march 1965 , though the mercury control center still retained primary responsibility for control of these flights it became fully operational for the flight of gemini 4 the following june , and has been the primary flight control center for all subsequent us crewed space missions from project gemini forward mission control center on april 14 , 2011 it also has real ( though incomplete ) apollo command and service modules , intended to fly in the canceled apollo missions a similar memorial service was held at the johnson space center on february 4 , 2003 , for the astronauts who perished in the space shuttle columbia disaster three days before , which was attended by president george w the center is also responsible for direction of operations at white sands test facility in new mexico , which served as a backup space shuttle landing site and would have been the coordinating facility for the constellation program , which was planned to replace the shuttle program after 2010 , but was canceled in 2009 about 3,200 civil servants , including 110 astronauts , are employed at johnson space center johnson space center was granted a five-year , 120-million extension of its agreement with the national space biomedical research institute at baylor college of medicine to study the health risks related to long-duration space flight the prebreathe reduction program is a research study program at the jsc that is currently being developed to improve the safety and efficiency of space walks from the international space station
