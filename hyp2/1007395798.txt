in 1918 , harlow shapley used cepheids to place initial constraints on the size and shape of the milky way , and of the placement of our sun within it in the mid 20th century , significant problems with the astronomical distance scale were resolved by dividing the cepheids into different classes with very different properties rr lyrae stars , then known as cluster variables , were recognized fairly early as being a separate class of variable , due in part to their short periods delta scuti variables are a-type stars on or near the main sequence at the lower end of the instability strip and were originally referred to as dwarf cepheids classical cepheids ( also known as population i cepheids , type i cepheids , or delta cepheid variables ) undergo pulsations with very regular periods on the order of days to months classical cepheids are population i variable stars which are 4â€“20 times more massive than the sun , and up to 100,000 times more luminous classical cepheids are used to determine distances to galaxies within the local group and beyond , and are a means by which the hubble constant can be established classical cepheids have also been used to clarify many characteristics of our galaxy , such as the sun 's height above the galactic plane and the galaxy 's local spiral structure type ii cepheids ( also termed population ii cepheids ) are population ii variable stars which pulsate with periods typically between 1 and 50 days a small proportion of cepheid variables have been observed to pulsate in two modes at the same time , usually the fundamental and first overtone , occasionally the second overtone chief among the uncertainties tied to the classical and type ii cepheid distance scale are : the nature of the period-luminosity relation in various passbands , the impact of metallicity on both the zero-point and slope of those relations , and the effects of photometric contamination ( blending ) and a changing ( typically unknown ) extinction law on cepheid distances delta cephei is also of particular importance as a calibrator of the cepheid period-luminosity relation since its distance is among the most precisely established for a cepheid , partly because it is a member of a star cluster and the availability of precise hubble space telescope/hipparcos parallaxes the accuracy of the distance measurements to cepheid variables and other bodies within 7,500 lightyears is vastly improved by combining images from hubble taken six months apart when the earth and hubble are on opposite sides of the sun
