typical mf radio stations can cover a radius of several hundred miles from the transmitter , with longer distances over water and damp earth mf radio station use ground waves to cover their listening areas a major use of these frequencies is am broadcasting ; am radio stations are allocated frequencies in the medium wave broadcast band from 526.5 & nbsp ; khz to 1606.5 & nbsp ; khz in europe ; in north america this extends from 525 & nbsp ; khz to 1705 & nbsp ; khz some countries also allow broadcasting in the 120-meter band from 2300 to 2495 & nbsp ; khz ; these frequencies are mostly used in tropical areas although these are medium frequencies , 120 meters is generally treated as one of the shortwave bands navtex , which is part of the current global maritime distress safety system occupies 518 & nbsp ; khz and 490 & nbsp ; khz for important digital text broadcasts many home-portable or cordless telephones , especially those that were designed in the 1980s , transmit low power fm audio signals between the table-top base unit and the handset on frequencies in the range 1600 to 1800 & nbsp ; khz the most common transmitting antenna , the quarter wave monopole , is physically large at these frequencies , requiring a tall radio mast the monopole antenna , particularly if electrical length requires a good , low resistance earth ground connection for efficiency , since the ground resistance is in series with the antenna and consumes transmitter power commercial radio stations use a ground system consisting of many heavy copper cables , buried a few feet in the earth , radiating from the base of the antenna to a distance of about a quarter wavelength receiving antennas do not have to be as efficient as transmitting antennas since in this band the signal to noise ratio is determined by atmospheric noise
