the proto-mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the cuchumatanes highlands of central guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where qʼanjobalan is spoken today according to the prevailing classification scheme by lyle campbell and terrence kaufman , the first division occurred around 2200 bce , when huastecan split away from mayan proper after its speakers moved northwest along the gulf coast of mexico when speakers of proto-tzeltalan later separated from the chʼolan group and moved south into the chiapas highlands , they came into contact with speakers of mixe–zoque languages according to an alternative theory by robertson and houston , huastecan stayed in the guatemalan highlands with speakers of chʼolan–tzeltalan , separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by kaufman this has led to hypotheses that the early maya were dominated by speakers of mixe–zoquean languages , possibly the olmec this theory was first proposed by in the case of the xincan and lencan languages , on the other hand , mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords mayan language specialists such as campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between maya and the lencan and xinca people , possibly during the classic period ( 250–900 ) although a single prestige language was by far the most frequently recorded on extant hieroglyphic texts , evidence for at least three different varieties of mayan have been discovered within the hieroglyphic corpus—an eastern chʼolan variety found in texts written in the southern maya area and the highlands , a western chʼolan variety diffused from the usumacinta region from the mid-7th century on , and a yucatecan variety found in the texts from the yucatán peninsula the reason why only few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that these served as prestige dialects throughout the maya region ; hieroglyphic texts would have been composed in the language of the elite stephen houston , john robertson and david stuart have suggested that the specific variety of chʼolan found in the majority of southern lowland glyphic texts was a language they dub '' classic chʼoltiʼan '' , the ancestor language of the modern chʼortiʼ and chʼoltiʼ languages during the spanish colonization of central america , all indigenous languages were eclipsed by spanish , which became the new prestige language the use of mayan languages in many important domains of society , including administration , religion and literature , came to an end yet the maya area was more resistant to outside influence than others , the last independent maya kingdom ( tayasal ) was not conquered until 1697 , some 170 years after the first conquistadores arrived the maya area is now dominated by the spanish language while a number of mayan languages are moribund or are considered endangered , others remain quite viable , with speakers across all age groups and native language use in all domains of society grenoble & whaley ( 1998 ) characterized the situation this way : '' mayan languages typically have several hundreds of thousands of speakers , and a majority of mayas speak a mayan language as a first language rather than being at the end of a process of language shift , mayan languages are writes : '' in the recent maya cultural activism , maintenance of mayan languages has been promoted in an attempt to support 'unified maya identity ' however , there is a complex array of perceptions about mayan language and identity among mayans who i researched in momostenango , a highland maya community in guatemala '' this pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different mayan languages , some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as dialects of a single language but , given that the term '' dialect '' has been used by some with racism overtones in the past , as scholars made a spurious distinction between amerindian '' dialects '' and european '' languages '' , the preferred usage in mesoamerica in recent years has been to designate the linguistic varieties spoken by different ethnic group as separate languages a wide range of proposals have tried to link the mayan family to other language families or isolates , but none is generally supported by linguists the mayan language family is extremely well documented , and its internal genealogical classification scheme is widely accepted and established , except for some minor unresolved differences the chʼolan languages were formerly widespread throughout the maya area , but today the language with most speakers is chʼol , spoken by 130,000 in chiapas another related language , now endangered , is chʼortiʼ , which is spoken by 30,000 in guatemala chʼolan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology , and are closely related to the classic maya language found in the central lowlands gordon ( 2005 ) recognizes eastern and western dialects of jakaltek , as well as mochoʼ ( also called mototzintlec ) , a language with less than 200 speakers in the chiapan villages of tuzantán and mototzintla however , owing to a historical division between the two ethnic groups , the achi maya do not regard themselves as kʼicheʼ the other three yucatecan languages are mopan , spoken by around 10,000 speakers primarily in belize ; itzaʼ , an extinct or moribund language from guatemala 's petén basin ; there were only 12 remaining native speakers in 1986 according to gordon , raymond g chicomuceltec was a language related to wastek and spoken in chiapas that became extinct some time before 1982 it has been suggested that proto-mayan was a tonal language , based on the fact that four different contemporary mayan languages have tone ( yucatec , uspantek , san bartolo tzotzil mistakenly writes tzeltal for tzotzil , states that the reports of a fully developed tone contrast in san bartolome tzotzil are inaccurate and mochoʼ ) , but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated tone in different ways , campbell considers this unlikely since the colonial period , practically all maya writing has used a latin script formerly these were based largely on the spanish alphabet and varied between authors , and it is only recently that standardized alphabets have been established the cordemex contains a lengthy introduction on the history , importance , and key resources of written yucatec maya , including a summary of the orthography used by the project ( pp subsequently , the guatemalan academy of mayan languages ( known by its spanish acronym almg ) , founded in 1986 , adapted these standards to 22 mayan languages ( primarily in guatemala ) josephe dechicchis , '' revisiting an imperfection in mayan orthography '' , journal of policy studies 37 ( march 2011 ) other major maya languages , primarily in the mexican state of chiapas , such as tzotzil , tzeltal , chʼol , and tojolabʼal , are not generally included in this reformation , and are sometimes written with the conventions standardized by the chiapan '' state center for indigenous language , art , and literature '' ( celali ) , which for instance writes '' ts '' rather than '' tz '' ( thus tseltal and tsotsil ) from the classic language to the present day , a body of literature has been written in mayan languages shortly after the spanish conquest , the mayan languages began to be written with latin letters colonial-era literature in mayan languages include the famous popol vuh , a mythico-historical narrative written in 17th century classical quiché but believed to be based on an earlier work written in the 1550s , now lost in addition to these singular works , many early grammars of indigenous languages , called '' artes '' , were written by priests and friars because indigenous languages were excluded from the education systems of mexico and guatemala after independence , mayan peoples remained largely illiterate in their native languages , learning to read and write in spanish , if at all however , since the establishment of the cordemex and the guatemalan academy of mayan languages ( 1986 ) , native language literacy has begun to spread and a number of indigenous writers have started a new tradition of writing in mayan languages notable among this new generation is the kʼicheʼ poet humberto akʼabʼal , whose works are often published in dual-language spanish/kʼicheʼ editions , as well as kʼicheʼ scholar luis enrique sam colop ( 1955–2011 ) whose translations of the popol vuh into both spanish and modern kʼicheʼ achieved high acclaim
