intensity-based methods compare intensity patterns in images via correlation metrics , while feature-based methods find correspondence between image features such as points , lines , and contours image registration algorithms can also be classified according to the transformation models they use to relate the target image space to the reference image space linear transformations are global in nature , thus , they can not model local geometric differences between images spatial methods operate in the image domain , matching intensity patterns or features in images some of the feature matching algorithms are outgrowths of traditional techniques for performing manual image registration , in which an operator chooses corresponding control points ( cp ) in images when the number of control points exceeds the minimum required to define the appropriate transformation model , iterative algorithms like ransac can be used to robustly estimate the parameters of a particular transformation type ( e.g frequency-domain methods find the transformation parameters for registration of the images while working in the transform domain unlike many spatial-domain algorithms , the phase correlation method is resilient to noise , occlusions , and other defects typical of medical or satellite images additionally , the phase correlation uses the fast fourier transform to compute the cross-correlation between the two images , generally resulting in large performance gains the method can be extended to determine rotation and scaling differences between two images by first converting the images to log-polar coordinates interactive methods reduce user bias by performing certain key operations automatically while still relying on the user to guide the registration many new features have been derived for cost functions based on matching methods via large deformations have emerged in the field computational anatomy including measure matching which are pointsets or landmarks without correspondence , curve matching and surface matching via mathematical currents and varifolds due to the vast range of applications to which image registration can be applied , it is impossible to develop a general method that is optimized for all uses medical image registration ( for data of the same patient taken at different points in time such as change detection or tumor monitoring ) often additionally involves elastic ( also known as nonrigid ) registration to cope with deformation of the subject ( due to breathing , anatomical changes , and so forth ) using control points ( automatically or manually entered ) , the computer performs transformations on one image to make major features align with a second or multiple images in cryo-tem instability causes specimen drift and many fast acquisitions with accurate image registration is required to preserve high resolution and obtain high signal to noise images
