on his first day of school at brighton primary school ( now big rock primary school ) , baxter burned his hand on a stove and later used this incident to represent the failure of institutional education baxter said of his early life that he felt a gap between himself and other people , '' increased considerably by the fact that i was born in new zealand , and grew up there till i was nine , and then attended an english boarding school for a couple of years , and came back to new zealand at thirteen , in the first flush of puberty , quite out of touch with my childhood companions and uncertain whether i was an englishman or a new zealander '' baxter began writing poetry at the age of seven , and he accumulated a large body of technically accomplished work both before and during his teenage years in 1940 , baxter began attending king 's high school , dunedin , where he was bullied , because of his differences to other students ( in personality , voice and background ) , his lack of interest in team sports and his family 's pacifism between 1942 and 1946 , baxter drafted around 600 poems , saying later in life that his experiences as a teenager were painful but '' created a gap in which the poems were able to grow '' in 1943 , baxter 's final year of high school , he wrote to a friend that he was considering becoming a lawyer , but was '' not decided on it '' : '' if i should find it possible to live by writing i would gladly do so allen curnow selected six poems from the collection for 1945 collection a book of new zealand verse 1923–1945 , and described baxter 's poems as '' a new occurrence in new zealand : strong in impulse and confident in invention , with qualities of youth in verse which we have lacked '' baxter failed to complete his course work at the university of otago due to increasing alcoholism , and was forced to take a range of odd jobs from 1945–7 it was during this time that he had his first significant relationship , with a young medical student , but the relationship ended due to his alcoholism he wrote the collection of poems cold spring about this early failed relationship , but it was not published until after his death in 1996 he completed his teaching course in december 1952 , and subsequently published his third major collection of poems , the fallen house in 1954 he was appointed assistant master at epuni school , lower hutt , and it was here that he wrote a series of children 's poems published later as the tree house , and other poems for children ( 1974 ) in 1957 baxter took a course in roman catholicism and his collection of poems in fires of no return , published in 1958 by oxford university press , was influenced by his new faith this was his first work to be published internationally , though it was not critically well-received later in 1958 , baxter received a unesco stipend to study educational publishing and began an extended journey through asia , and especially india , where rabindranath tagore 's university shantiniketan was one of the inspirations for baxter 's later community at jerusalem , new zealand the first half of the 1960s also saw , however , baxter struggling to make ends meet on a postman 's wage , having resigned from the department of education in 1963 and refused to take work as a schoolmaster however , in 1966 baxter 's critically acclaimed collection of poems pig island letters was published in which his writing found a new level of clarity the five goals baxter devised for the commune were : '' to share one 's goods ; to speak the truth , not hiding one 's heart from others ; to love one another and show it by the embrace ; to take no job where one has to lick the boss 's arse ; to learn from the maori side of the fence '' paul millar , a baxter scholar and personal friend of sturm , who had been appointed as her literary executor after her death , cautioned against reading the letter as turning sturm into a victim : '' leaving apart how appalling this letter is – a betrayal on so many levels from the brutal act described , the lack of shame in the description , and the profound betrayal of trust – its publicity is once again putting jacquie in a subordinate position to baxter , a bit player in his narrative '' mark williams , emeritus professor of english at victoria university , said the admission was consistent with what he knew of baxter : '' he observed his own adulteries objectively as part of the fallen human condition '' baxter and sturm 's great-grandson , jack mcdonald , wrote that the account was '' sickening '' and that he believed his great-grandmother '' would never have wanted these brutal details made public '' he also noted that she never received sufficient credit for connecting baxter to the māori world : '' the reality is that nana had introduced baxter to everything he knew about māoritanga '' an allegation of attempted rape followed when , in april 2019 , the new zealand news outlet stuff published an account by rosalind lewis ( ros ) , who had been at the jerusalem commune in 1970 when she was aged 18 years new zealand poet laureate vincent o'sullivan wrote in 1976 that baxter is an inherently new zealand poet : '' that is the proportion of baxter 's achievement – the most complete delineation yet of a new zealand mind '' a common theme in baxter 's extensive body of writing was strong criticism of new zealand society his biographer paul millar said : '' if , at times , baxter appears to evaluate new zealand society harshly , his judgements are always from the perspective of one intimately involved in the social process in his critical study lives of the poets , michael schmidt claimed that baxter was '' one of the most precocious poets of the century '' whose neglect outside of new zealand is baffling the critic martin seymour-smith ranked baxter above robert lowell ( '' baxter knew all about narcissism and vanity , and is a much superior poet '' ) , and defended baxter 's high reputation on the grounds of his spiritual and intellectual seeking : '' baxter 's energy and sheer intelligence , his refusal to give way to mean cerebral impulses or to give up his terrible struggle with himself , are sufficient to justify his high position in new zealand poetry '' beyond the palisade , 1944 blow , wind of fruitfulness , 1948 hart crane ;
