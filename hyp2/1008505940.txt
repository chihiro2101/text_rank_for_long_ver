these early headphones used moving iron speaker , with either single-ended or balanced armatures the requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used , so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance , resulting in poor sound quality those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity some very sensitive headphones , such as those manufactured by brandes around 1919 , were commonly used for early radio work smaller earbud type earpieces , which plugged into the user 's ear canal , were first developed for hearing aids the earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a crystal earpiece to produce sound in the professional audio sector , headphones are used in live situations by disc jockeys with a dj mixer , and sound engineers for monitoring signal sources in military applications , audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones in-the-ear or insert style earphones are used more commonly today as they provide higher levels of interaural attenuation , introduce less variability when testing 6,000 and 8,000 & nbsp ; hz , and avoid testing issues resulting from collapsed ear canals along with etymotic research er-2a insert earphones , the sennheiser hda300 and koss hv/1a circum-aural earphones are the only models that have reference equivalent threshold sound pressure level values for the extended high frequency range as described by ansi standards because specific headphones are used in the initial audiometer calibration process , they can not be replaced with any other set of headphones , even from the same make and model electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers may be readily applied to headphones , because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers in recent years , impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered cmos-based portable electronics a modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier , with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load therefore , lower impedance headphones tend to be louder and more efficient , but also demand a more capable amplifier historically , many headphones had relatively high impedance , often over 500 & nbsp ; ohms so they could operate well with high-impedance tube amplifiers unfortunately , this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern , low-impedance headphones it thus indicates how loud the headphones are for a given electrical drive level as the output voltage ( but not power ) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones , db/mw is often more useful if converted into db/v using ohm 's law : : \mathrm alternatively , online calculators can be used pairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones this type of headphone generally tends to be smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones , resulting in less attenuation of outside noise custom in-ear headphones use castings of the ear canal to create custom-molded plugs that provide added comfort and noise isolation this type combines advantages of earbuds and in-ear headphones â€“ depending on the environment and requirements of the user , they provide passive noise reduction for quality mode ( conversation or active music listening ) or they give control over the sound environment around user in comfort mode ( stand by or background voice/music listening ) most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone , mute function and switching between headset and handset they come in all shapes and sizes , depending on use , required noise attenuation , and fidelity of communication needed active noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone , amplifier , and speaker to pick up , amplify , and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form ; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source , which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone they require a power source , usually a battery , to drive their circuitry headphones use various types of transducer to convert electrical signals to sound the electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field ; depending on the polarity of this field , the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates air is forced through the perforations ; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane , a sound wave is generated the high-frequency response means that the low-midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band , which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types original electrets were also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics planar magnetic ( also known as orthodynamic ) headphones use similar technology to electrostatic headphones , with some fundamental differences left a balanced armature is a sound transducer design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems as illustrated in the second diagram , when there is electric current through the coil , it magnetizes the armature one way or the other , causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound although this reduces its efficiency , this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other today they are typically used only in in-ear headphones and hearing aids , where their high efficiency and diminutive size is a major advantage below 20 & nbsp ; hz and above 16 & nbsp ; khz ) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by pioneer , their two models used a flat sheet of film that limited the maximum volume of air movement magnetostriction headphones , sometimes sold under the label bonephones , work by vibrating against the side of head , transmitting sound via bone conduction magnetostriction headphones though , are limited in their fidelity compared to conventional headphones that rely on the normal workings of the ear while a loudspeaker must use a relatively large ( often 15 '' or 18 '' ) speaker driver to reproduce low frequencies , headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide ( or much smaller , as is the case with in-ear monitor headphones ) headphones ' impressive low-frequency performance is possible because they are so much closer to the ear that they only need to move relatively small volumes of air headphones are also useful for video games that use 3d positional audio processing algorithms , as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source ( such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gunfire ) stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues ( stereo separation ) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels when the sounds from two speakers mix , they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate direction binaural recordings use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase , with very little amplitude difference below 2 & nbsp ; khz , often using a dummy head it is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones , to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction , by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels extended periods of exposure to high sound pressure levels created by headphones at high volume settings may be damaging to hearing ; nearly 50 % of teenagers and young adults ( 12 to 35 years old ) in middle and high income countries listen to unsafe levels of sound on their personal audio devices and smartphones the usual way of limiting sound volume on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power this has the additional undesirable effect of being dependent of the efficiency of the headphones ; a device producing the maximum allowed power may not produce adequate volume when paired with low-efficiency , high-impedance equipment , while the same amount of power can reach dangerous levels with very efficient earphones hearing risk from headphones ' use also applies to workers who must wear electronic or communication headsets as part of their daily job ( i.e
