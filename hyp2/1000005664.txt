at least 119 honourable members from scotland , wales and northern ireland exercising an important , and probably often decisive , effect on english politics while they themselves have no say in the same matters in scotland , wales and northern ireland ? to illustrate his point , dalyell chose the example of a member of parliament for west lothian who could vote on matters affecting the english town of blackburn ( in lancashire ) , but not on matters concerning the blackburn in his own constituency '' the question is more commonly assumed to refer to the anomaly that came into being in 1999 , with scottish , welsh and northern ireland members at westminster allowed to vote upon english matters , but mps for english constituencies having no influence on affairs which were devolved to scotland , wales or northern ireland the ability of all westminster mps to vote on scottish legislation has not been legally diminished by devolution , as made clear by section 28 ( 7 ) of the scotland act 1998 , which states that the legislative powers of the scottish parliament do '' not affect the power of the parliament of the united kingdom to make laws for scotland '' the opposition conservative party commissioned a report , '' devolution , the west lothian question and the future of the union '' , which proposed some procedural changes restricting the participation of mps representing non-english constituencies during the passage of bills relating only to england the commission proposed that bills in the house of commons which affected england solely or differently should require a majority vote of mps representing english constituencies having won a majority in that election , the conservative government used a change in standing orders in october 2015 to give mps representing english ( or english and welsh ) constituencies a '' veto '' over laws affecting only england ( or only england and wales ) thus , a new law can not be imposed only on england by a majority of all mps if a majority of english mps are opposed however , a proposed new law can still be vetoed by a majority of all mps even if a majority of english mps are in favour the creation of a devolved english parliament , with full legislative powers , akin to the scottish parliament is seen by some as a solution to this problem , campaign for an english parliament , with full legislative powers also being conferred on the existing welsh parliament '' peter hain , who campaigned for a welsh assembly , warned creating an english parliament or trying to stop scottish and welsh mps from voting on england-only matters would break up the union chuka umunna suggested in july 2015 that the labour party should support the creation of a separate english parliament , as part of a federal united kingdom the labour government of tony blair attempted to address part of the west lothian question by introducing english regional assemblies with no legislative powers during periods when the predominantly unionist mps from northern ireland deprived labour of working majorities , conservatives supported the principle that '' every member of the house of commons is equal to every other member of the house of commons '' an argument against the idea of having a lower number of mps , in return for more devolved powers , is that if the national parliament takes important decisions ( such as waging war ) then people should be fully represented
