he was intended for a medical career and studied in london for two years before his determination to be a musician gained the upper hand after the war simpson lectured extensively and founded the exploratory concerts society ; in 1951 he joined the music staff of the bbc and became one of its best-known and most respected music producers , remaining with the corporation for nearly three decades simpson 's other great passions were astronomy ( he was a member of the british astronomical association and & nbsp ; – unusually for an amateur & nbsp ; – was made a fellow of the royal astronomical society ) and pacifism , specifically addressed in the title of his tenth string quartet , for peace ) his extensive output of chamber music comprised 15 string quartets , two string quintets , a clarinet quintet , piano trio , clarinet trio , horn trio , violin sonata and a number of non-standard chamber ensemble works as well as works for piano , a sonata for two pianos , and a major organ work entitled ( after the famous remark attributed to galileo ) variation form was important to him , and in addition to variation-movements on his own themes he composed orchestral variations on themes of nielsen and johann sebastian bach , as well as a set of piano variations on a palindromic theme by haydn to which he returned in his large-scale string quartet no 4–6 can be regarded as variations upon the compositional processes , rather than the themes , of beethoven 's three rasumovsky quartets , op robert simpson is said to have written and destroyed four symphonies ( one of which even used serial procedures ) before his first published symphony the official , published symphonies include the following : symphony no ; violin concerto ( 1959 ) : a work of some forty minutes , dedicated to the violinist ernest element , withdrawn by the composer late in his life ; piano concerto ( 1967 ) : a one-movement twenty-minute work , falling into several sections and written for the pianist john ogdon ; flute concerto ( 1989 ) : a one movement work of twenty-five minutes duration , commissioned by and dedicated to the flautist susan milan simpson composed 15 numbered string quartets ; a quartet preceding this sequence was written as part of his course at durham university and still exists there 4–6 are a clearly distinct group related to three beethoven quartets , though they can all be performed as entirely independent compositions 8 has the label eretmapodites gilletti , and the quartet is dedicated to two people including the discoverer of the mosquito with that scientific name ; the ninth quartet , from 1982 , is a one-movement ( but subdivided , with slow and scherzando sections ) palindromic 32 variations and fugue on a theme by haydn ; number 10 is entitled '' for peace '' 1–3 at the arts council of great britain building in london sw1 on 11 february 1955 , simpson wrote that '' although they were not consciously designed as a group , they nevertheless seem to fall into a natural sequence '' 1 ( 1951–52 ) : is in two movements , quick and slow ; the second movement is a set of variations on a palindromic theme stated by the viola ( simpson made a transcription of this movement as an independent piece for full string orchestra 1–3 , constituted '' a close study of beethoven 's three rasumovsky quartets , op the three simpson quartets offer , in his own idiom , '' musical analogies '' to the procedures of beethoven 's three quartets , but they can be performed without reference to the beethoven and indeed without reference to each other at about 57 minutes ' duration , it is one of the longest continuous movements for string quartet ever written the 32 quartet variations take simpson 's fascination with formal symmetry to a new extreme , though they are grouped to correspond to first movement , scherzo and slow movement 10 , but is much more turbulent and intense in character : simpson said he was conscious of the influence of beethoven 's f minor quartet , op.95 in this work the entire basis of the material for the work is outlined in the opening introduction , with the main theme having some sort of parallel with beethoven 's c sharp minor quartet ; violin sonata ( 1984 ) : this is a two movement structure , the first movement a vigorous allegro , and the second combining the characters of a slow movement , scherzo and finale ; string trio ( 1987 ) : a three movement work it contains some of the most peaceful music the composer ever wrote the slow , final coda is one of the darkest endings in all string chamber music literature the composer also re-orchestrated this work for orchestral brass his earliest published writings were as a reviewer and critic ; but before long his focus had shifted towards being an advocate for widely unappreciated or misunderstood composers like anton bruckner , carl nielsen and jean sibelius , as well as to the analysis of better-known figures ( such as beethoven ) whenever he felt able to illuminate their work from a composer 's perspective besides writing the 'introduction ' to the first volume and the preludial essay 'stravinsky , hindemith and others ' of the second , simpson added several pithy editorial footnotes to the chapters of his contributors in addition , he wrote the essay on rachmaninoff found in volume 2 'ianus germinus : music in scandinavia ' ( 1960 ) , in twentieth century music & nbsp ; – an international symposium of essays on current trends in music , ed 'the seventh symphony of bruckner : an analysis ' music review ( 1947 ) : 178–187 the music was performed by the leicestershire schools symphony orchestra and the lp was released by unicorn records to great critical acclaim in 1973 a special edition of the television programme aquarius called the unknown warrior gave considerable coverage to the recording session and a camera crew also joined robert simpson and members of the orchestra during a visit they made to the composer 's home in shoreham ( see video links below ) this cbs release included the 22nd symphony , brian 's setting of the 23rd psalm ( which clearly belongs to the mainstream british choral tradition of vaughan williams and parry ) and the english suite rustic scenes which contains some highly original music
