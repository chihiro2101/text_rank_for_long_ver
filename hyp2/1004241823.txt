ernst stuhlinger , enabling technology for space transportation ( the century of space science , page 66 , kluwer , the world 's first spaceport for orbital and human launches , the baikonur cosmodrome in southern kazakhstan , started as a soviet military rocket range in 1955 the launch complex used , site 1 , has reached a special symbolic significance and is commonly called gagarin 's start a large number of unmanned flights , as well as the early human flights , were carried out at cape canaveral space force station breaking with tradition , in june 2004 on a runway at mojave air and space port , california , a human was for the first time launched to space in a privately funded , suborbital spaceflight , that was intended to pave the way for future commercial spaceflights such launches also provide a desirable orientation for arriving at a geostationary orbit however , altitude of the launch site is not a driving factor in spaceport placement because most of the delta-v for a launch is spent on achieving the required horizontal orbital speed the 2012 space studies program of the international space university studied the economic benefit of a network of spaceports throughout the solar system beginning from earth and expanding outwardly in phases , within its team project operations and service infrastructure for space ( oasis ) oasis official website its analysis claimed that the first phase , placing the '' node 1 '' spaceport with space tug services in low earth orbit ( leo ) , would be commercially profitable and reduce transportation costs to geosynchronous orbit by as much as 44 % ( depending on the launch vehicle ) the second phase would add a node 2 spaceport on the lunar surface to provide services including lunar ice mining and delivery of rocket propellants back to node 1
