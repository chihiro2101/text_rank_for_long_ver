increased flow , as during a flood or high-rainfall season , can make permanent changes to the streambed by displacing rocks and boulders , by deposition of alluvium , or by creating new channels for flowing water ) if the flow passes next to the obstruction , an eddy may form behind the obstruction ; although eddies are typically sheltered areas where boaters can stop to rest , scout , or leave the main current , they may be swirling and whirlpool-like this can make it difficult for a boater , who has stopped in that particular eddy , to re-enter the river due to a wall of water that can be several feet high at the point at which the eddy meets the river flow the most widely used grading system is the international scale of river difficulty , where whitewater ( either an individual rapid , or the entire river ) is classed in six categories from class i ( the easiest and safest ) to class vi ( the most difficult and most dangerous ) harder rapids ( for example a grade-v rapid on a mainly grade-iii river ) are often portaged , a french term for carrying although some rapids may be easier at high flows because features are covered or '' washed-out '' , high water usually makes rapids more difficult and dangerous at flood stage , even rapids that are usually easy can contain lethal and unpredictable hazards ( briefly adapted from the american version of the international scale of river difficulty ) class 1 : very small rough areas , requires no maneuvering ( skill level : none ) class 2 : some rough water , maybe some rocks , small drops , might require maneuvering ( skill level : basic paddling ) class 3 : medium waves , maybe a 3–5 & nbsp ; ft drop , but not much considerable danger , may require significant maneuvering ( skill level : experienced paddling ) class 4 : whitewater , large waves , long rapids , rocks , maybe a considerable drop , sharp maneuvers may be needed ( skill level : advanced whitewater experience ) class 5 : whitewater , large waves , continuous rapids , large rocks and hazards , maybe a large drop , precise maneuvering , often characterized by '' must make '' moves , i.e strainers occur naturally most often on the outside curves of rivers where the current undermines the shore , exposing the roots of trees and causing them to fall into the river and form strainers in an emergency , climbing on top of a strainer may be better so as not to be pinned against the object under the water holes , or '' hydraulics '' , ( also known as '' stoppers '' or '' souse-holes '' ( see also pillows ) are formed when water pours over the top of a submerged object , or underwater ledges , causing the surface water to flow back upstream toward the object holes can be particularly dangerous—a boater or watercraft may become stuck under the surface in the recirculating water—or entertaining play-spots , where paddlers use the holes ' features to perform various playboating moves in a low-head dam , the 'hole ' has a very wide , uniform structure with no escape point , and the sides of the hydraulic ( ends of the dam ) are often blocked by a man-made wall , making paddling around , or slipping off , the side of the hydraulic , where the bypass water flow would become normal ( laminar ) , difficult waves are noted by the large , smooth face on the water rushing down these standing waves can be smooth , or particularly the larger ones , can be breaking waves ( also called '' whitecaps '' or '' haystacks '' ) this is often counterintuitive because it requires turning the boat such that it is no longer parallel to the current typically , they are calm spots where the downward movement of water is partially or fully arrested—a place to rest or to make one 's way upstream however , in very powerful water , eddies can have powerful , swirling currents that trap or even can flip boats and from which escape can be very difficult they can be extremely dangerous features of a rapid because a person can get trapped underneath them under water undercuts sometimes have pillows , but other times the water just flows smoothly under them , which can indicate that the rock is undercut another major whitewater feature is a sieve , which is a narrow , empty space through which water flows between two obstructions , usually rocks thumb people use many types of whitewater craft to make their way down a rapid , preferably with finesse and control rafts sometimes have inflatable floors , with holes around the edges , that allow water that splashes into the boat to easily flow to the side and out the bottom ( these are typically called '' self-bailers '' because the occupants do not have to '' bail '' water out with a bucket ) others have simple fabric floors , without anyway for water to escape , these are called '' bucket boats '' , both for their tendency to hold water like a bucket , and because the only way to get water out of them is by bailing with a bucket open whitewater canoes often have large airbags and in some cases foam , usually 2-lb density ethyl foam , firmly attached to the sides , to displace water in the boat when swamped by big waves and holes and to allow water to be spilled from the boat while still in the river by floating it up on its side using the foam and bags
