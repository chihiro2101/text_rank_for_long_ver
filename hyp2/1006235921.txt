the difference between a synthesizer module and an effects unit is that an effects unit will have sockets for input and output of the audio signal and knobs or switches for the musician to control various parameters of the device ( for example , the rate of a chorus pedal ) while a synthesizer module may have sockets for input and output , but will also have sockets so that the device 's parameters can be further controlled by other devices/modules ( for example , to connect an external low frequency oscillator to a delay module to get the chorus effect some examples include the voltage controlled oscillator ( vco ) , which may have options for sync ( hard or soft ) , linear or exponential frequency modulation , and variable waveshape ; the voltage controlled filter ( vcf ) that may have both resonance and bandwidth controls ; and the envelope follower which may provide outputs at each stage of the process there are some standards which manufacturers followed for their range of physical synthesizers , such as 1v/octave control voltages , and gate / trigger thresholds providing general compatibility ; however , connecting synthesizers from different manufacturers may require cables with different kinds of plugs some standard modules found on almost any modular synthesizer are : sources - characterized by an output , but no signal input ; it may have control inputs : vco â€“ voltage-controlled oscillator , a continuous voltage source , which will output a signal whose frequency is a function of the settings in its basic form these may be simple waveforms ( most usually a square wave or a sawtooth wave , but also includes pulse , triangle and sine waves ) , however these can be dynamically changed through such controls as sync , frequency modulation , and self-modulation it is generally used as a control voltage for another module the rectangular wave can be used as a logic / timing / trigger function sequencer , also sometimes called an analog step sequencer , is a family of compound module types which may be a source or a processor , see also below as a source , depending upon the configuration , it may produce a sequence of voltages , usually set by adjusting values on front panel knobs designs may allow for stepping forwards or backwards , oscillating patterns , random order , or only using a limited number of stages an example of an analog sequencer and controller with this level of complexity is the doepfer a-154 , a-155 combination lpg - low pass gate , is a compound module , similar to a vca and a vcf , except that the circuit uses a resistive opto-isolator ( vactrol ) to respond to the control voltage , which also filters the sound as it amplifies , allowing more high frequency information through at higher amplifications rm - ring modulator - two audio inputs are utilized to create sum and difference frequencies while suppressing the original signals depending upon the design , usually an ascending edge ( trigger ) , captures the value of the voltage at the input , and outputs this voltage until the trigger input reads another voltage and repeats the process sequencer , ( see also above ) , as a processor , may have a signal input into each step , ( location or stage ) , which is output , when stepped to custom control inputs - it is possible to connect any kind of voltage to a modular synthesizer as long as it remains in the usable voltage range of the instrument , usually -15v to +15v ) most analog modular systems use a system in which the frequency is exponentially related to the pitch ( such as 1 volt/octave or 1.2 volts/octave ) , sometimes called '' linear '' because the human ear perceives frequencies in a logarithmic fashion , with each octave having the same perceptual size ; some synthesizers ( such as korg ms-20 , eti 4600 ) use a volts/hertz system , where the frequency ( but not the perceived pitch ) is linear in the voltage while potentially lacking the physical presence of desirable analog sound generation , real voltage manipulation , knobs , sliders , cables , and leds , software modular synthesizers offer the infinite variations and visual patching at a more affordable price and in a compact form factor a modular synthesizer has a case or frame into which arbitrary modules can be fitted ; modules are usually connected together using patch cords and a system may include modules from different sources , as long as it fits the form factors of the case and uses the same electrical specifications however , the manufacturer provides mechanisms to allow the user to connect modules in different orders and often to connect external components or modules ( chosen and supplied by the user ) between those of the instrument in digital times the clean logical layout of these matrices has inspired a number of manufacturers like arturia to include digitally programmable matrices in their analog or virtual analog synthesizers many fully digital synthesizers , like the alesis ion , make use of the logic and nomenclature of a '' modulation matrix '' , even when the graphical layout of a hardware matrix is completely absent reconfigurable systems allow certain signals to be routed through modules in different orders
