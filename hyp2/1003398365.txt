ceremonial maces originated in the ancient near east , where they were used as symbols of rank and authority across the region during the late stone age , bronze age , and early iron age in later mesopotamian art , the mace is more clearly associated with authority ; by the old babylonian period the most common figure on cylinder seals ( a type of seal used to authenticate clay documents ) is a repeated type now known as '' the figure with mace '' who wears a royal hat , holds a mace in his left hand , and is thought to represent a generic king the ceremonial function of the mace may have passed to the late roman empire from the ancient near east by way of persia , and from there to other european cultures the earliest ceremonial maces in france and england were practical weapons intended to protect the king 's person , borne by the sergeant-at-arms , a royal bodyguard established in france by philip ii , and in england probably by richard i , ( c the history of the civic mace ( carried by the sergeants-at-arms ) begins around the middle of the 13th century , though no examples from that period remain today at the time , ornamented civic maces were considered an infringement of one of the privileges of the king 's sergeants , who alone deserved to bear maces enriched with costly metals , according to a house of commons petition of 1344 several other cities and towns subsequently acquired silver maces , and the 16th century saw almost universal use early in the 15th century , the flanged end of the mace ( the head of the war mace ) was carried uppermost , with the small button bearing the royal arms in the base this mace is still in use today , though without the original head the ceremonial maces of the australian house of representatives and the australian senate symbolise both the authority of each chamber and the royal authority of australia 's monarch at the beginning and end of every day the house sits , the speaker of the house enters and leaves the house preceded by the sergeant-at-arms carrying the mace on his or her right shoulder the house of assembly reconvened with a temporary wooden mace loaned by canada ;

the speaker ( politics ) normally enters following a mace-bearer ( normally the sergeant-at-arms ) , who subsequently sets the mace on the clerks ' table to begin the sitting before the reigning monarch or one of his or her representatives ( the governor general or one of the lieutenant governors ) may enter a legislative chamber , the mace must be completely hidden from view during the election of the speaker , the mace is removed from the table to show that the house is not fully constituted until the new speaker takes the chair and the mace is laid on the table the oldest documented use of a ceremonial mace in a legislature of a british north american colony was at the 1st general assembly of nova scotia , which convened in 1758 the new house of commons of canada then adopted the mace , where it remained until 1916 in the immediate aftermath , the house of commons used the surviving senate mace , then the mace of the ontario provincial legislature for three weeks , after which a wooden mace was crafted and used in june 1916 , the city of london donated a new mace made with the remains of the one destroyed ;
