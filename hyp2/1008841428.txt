the effects of mercury and acid rain pollution are considered to be among some of the most important factors in the reproductive success of common loons across the upper united states and lower canada , studies have shown that lake acidity tends to increase from west to east likely stemming from fossil fuel combustion that releases mercury and other harmful components of acid rain which are then moved eastward by prevailing winds resulting from this transmission of mercury , there is a significant positive correlation between mercury levels in fish and mercury levels in male , female , and chick blood of common loons ; consequently , an increase in mercury concentration in the blood of common loons and fish was seen with a decrease in ph related to this information , it was discovered that mercury concentration differs by sex and age of common loons male common loons were found to contain the highest blood mercury concentration likely due to the fact that they tend to consume bigger fish with higher mercury concentrations scientists found that the data from juveniles helped to best indicate the local mercury availability as they are fed exclusively from their natal territory elevated levels of mercury have been associated with changes in foraging as well as brooding behavior among adult common loons , especially in higher concentrations due to elevated mercury levels in lakes that common loons inhabit , many studies have revealed that a large number of common loons tested are at high risk for detrimental impacts on health and reproduction one study in the adirondack mountains in new york state showed that 21 % of male and 8 % of female common loons were at high risk for detrimental impacts high levels of heavy metals are linked to loons being in poor condition , males being affected more because they eat larger fish in addition , artificial floating nesting platforms have been provided for the common loon in some lakes to reduce the impact of changing water levels due to dams and other human activities
