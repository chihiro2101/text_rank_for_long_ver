the fact that eliezer was his first teacher , and the only one whom akiva later designates as '' rabbi '' , is of importance in settling the date of akiva 's birth akiva asked him , '' would you have made your vow if you had known that he would become a great scholar ? '' ben kalba sabu ' a replied , '' had i known that he would learn even one chapter or one single halakha , i would not have made the vow '' according to another source , talmud , avodah zara 20a akiva saw that at some future time he would take in marriage the wife of turnus rufus ( his executioner , also known as quintus tineius rufus ) after she converted to judaism , for which reason he spat on the ground ( for having come from a fetid drop ) , smiled ( at her conversion ) and wept ( at such beauty eventually rotting in the dust after death ) besides these , akiva had many disciples whose names have not been handed down , but the aggadah variously gives their number as 12,000 , genesis rabbah 61:3 24,000 yevamot 62b and 48,000 convinced of the necessity of a central authority for judaism , akiva became a devoted adherent and friend of rabban gamaliel , who aimed at constituting the patriarch the true spiritual chief of the jews rosh hashanah 2:9 however , akiva was just as firmly convinced that the power of the patriarch must be limited both by the written and the oral law , the interpretation of which lay in the hands of the learned ; and he was accordingly brave enough to act in ritual matters in rabban gamaliel 's own house contrary to the decisions of rabban gamaliel himself the only established fact concerning akiva 's connection with bar kochba is that he regarded bar kochba as the promised messiah ; yerushalmi ta'anit , 4 68d ; also sanhedrin 93b in yad harav herzog manuscript this is the only evidence of active participation by akiva in the revolution some modern scholars argue that akiva 's thousands of students died fighting for bar kochba , but this opinion was first formulated by nachman krochmal around 200 years ago and has no earlier source midrash shoher tov , on proverbs ( § 9 ) , jerusalem 1968 as this story credits the execution to religious rather than political reasons , it may be evidence against akiva 's having a role in the revolt the most common version of akiva 's death is that the roman government ordered him to stop teaching torah , on pain of death , and that he refused when turnus rufus , as he is called in jewish sources , ordered akiva 's execution , akiva is said to have recited his prayers calmly , though suffering agonies ; and when rufus asked him whether he was a sorcerer , since he felt no pain , akiva replied , '' i am no sorcerer ; but i rejoice at the opportunity now given to me to love my god 'with all my life , ' seeing that i have hitherto been able to love him only 'with all my means ' and 'with all my might , ' '' and began reciting the shema , with the word '' g-d is one ! '' he expired talmud yerushalmi berachot 9 14b , and somewhat modified in babylonian talmud 61b the version in the babylonian talmud tells it as a response of akiva to his students , who asked him how he could yet offer prayers to god he says to them , '' all my life i was worried about the verse , 'with all your soul ' ( and the sages expounded this to signify ) , even if he takes away your soul 14b ; tosefta hagigah 2:3 this serves at least to show how strong in later ages was the recollection of akiva 's philosophical speculation akiva 's opinion about the creation of man is recorded in pirkei avot : : how favored is man , for he was created after an image ; as scripture says , '' for in an image , god made man '' pirkei avot 3:14 akiva 's anthropology is based upon the principle that man was created בצלם , that is , not in the image of god—which would be בצלם אלהים—but after an image , after a primordial type ; or , philosophically speaking , after an idea—what philo calls in agreement with judean theology , '' the first heavenly man '' ( see adam ḳadmon ) strict monotheist that akiva was , he protested against any comparison of god with the angels , and declared the plain interpretation of כאחד ממנו genesis 3:22 as meaning '' like one of us '' to be arrant blasphemy mekhilta of rabbi ishmael , beshallaḥ 6 it is quite instructive to read how a christian of akiva 's generation , justin martyr , calls the literal interpretation—thus objected to by akiva—a '' jewish heretical one '' yoma , 75b this view of akiva 's , in spite of the energetic protests of his colleague rabbi ishmael , became the one generally accepted by his contemporaries '' leviticus 19:18 ; sifra , ḳedoshim , 4 he does not , indeed , maintain thereby that the execution of this command is equivalent to the performance of the whole law ; and in one of his polemic interpretations of scripture he protests strongly against a contrary opinion allegedly held by christians , and other non-jews since the diaspora , according to which judaism is at best '' simply morality weiss ) for , in spite of his philosophy , akiva was an extremely strict and national jew but he is far from representing strict justice as the only attribute of god : in agreement with the ancient israel theology of the מדת הדין , '' the attribute of justice '' , and מדת הרחמים , '' the attribute of mercy , '' genesis rabbah 12 , end ; the χαριστική and κολαστική of philo , quis rer 14a hence his maxim , referred to above , '' god rules the world in mercy , but according to the preponderance of good or bad in human acts concerning end times , akiva interpreted bible prophecy using what is now called the historicist methodology , which recognizes the day-year principle and the four kingdoms of daniel ( i.e justice as an attribute of god must also be exemplary for man the condition of the halakah , that is , of religious praxis , and indeed of judaism in general , was a very precarious one at the turn of the 1st century of the common era means for the theoretical study of the halachah were also scant ; both logic and exegesis—the two props of the halakah—being differently conceived by the various ruling tannaim , and differently taught the δευτερώσεις τοῦ καλουμένου ραββὶ ακιβά ( mishnah of the one called '' rabbi akiva '' ) mentioned by epiphanius , panarion , 33:9 , and 15 , end as well as the '' great mishnayot of akiva '' , in the midr 6:2 are probably not to be understood as independent mishnayot ( δευτερώσεις ) existing at that time , but as the teachings and opinions of akiva contained in the officially recognized mishnayot and midrashim at the same time , it is fair to consider the mishnah of judah ha-nasi ( called simply '' the mishnah '' ) , as well as the majority of all halakhic midrashim now extant , as derived from the school of akiva the enormous difference between the halakha before and after akiva may be briefly described as follows : the old halakha was ( as its name indicates ) the religious practice sanctioned as binding by tradition , to which were added extensions and ( in some cases ) limitations of the torah , arrived at by strict logical deduction the opposition offered by the sadducees ( which became especially strenuous in the first century bc ) led to the development the halakhic midrash , whose purpose was to deduce these amplifications of the law , by tradition and logic , out of the law itself it might be thought that with the destruction of the temple in jerusalem—which event made an end of sadduceeism—the halakhic midrash would also have disappeared , seeing that the halakha could now dispense with the midrash this probably would have been the case had not akiva created his own midrash , by means of which he was able '' to discover things that were even unknown to moses if the older halakha is to be considered as the product of the internal struggle between phariseeism and sadduceeism , the halacha of akiva must be conceived as the result of an external contest between judaism on the one hand and hellenism and hellenistic christianity on the other the bible could never again fill the place alone ; for the christians also regarded it as a divine revelation mention has already been made of the fact that akiva was the creator of a rabbinical bible version elaborated with the aid of his pupil , aquila ( though this is traditionally debated ) , and designed to become the common property of all jews akiva sought to apply the system of isolation followed by the pharisees ( פרושים those who '' separate '' themselves ) to doctrine as they did to practice , to the intellectual life as they did to that of daily discourse , and he succeeded in furnishing a firm foundation for his system as the fundamental principle of his system , akiva enunciates his conviction that the mode of expression used by the torah is quite different from that of every other book in the language of the torah nothing is mere form ; everything is essence 4:427 he thus gave the jewish mind not only a new field for its own employment , but , convinced both of the immutability of tanakh and of the necessity for development in judaism , he succeeded in reconciling these two apparently hopeless opposites by means of his remarkable method the following two illustrations will serve to make this clear : the high conception of woman 's dignity , which akiva shared in common with most other pharisees , induced him to abolish the oriental custom that banished niddah women from all social intercourse sifra , meẓora , end ; shabbat 64b the biblical legislation in exodus 21:7 could not be reconciled by akiva with his view of jewish ethics : for him a '' jewish slave '' is a contradiction in terms , for every jew is to be regarded as a prince bava metzia 113b akiva therefore teaches , in opposition to the old halakhah , that the sale of a daughter under age by her father conveys to her purchaser no legal title to marriage with her , but , on the contrary , carries with it the duty to keep the female slave until she is of age , and then to marry her 68a for similar reasons , akiva comes near abolishing the biblical ordinance of kil'ayim ; nearly every chapter in the treatise of that name contains a mitigation by akiva love for the holy land , which he as a genuine nationalist frequently and warmly expressed , avot of rabbi natan 26 was so powerful with him that he would have exempted agriculture from much of the rigor of the law upon his inquiry as to what these might be for , he received the answer , '' there will come a man , named akiva ben yosef , who will deduce halakhot from every little curve and crown of the letters of the law '' moses ' request to be allowed to see this man was granted ; but he became much dismayed as he listened to akiva 's teaching ; for he could not understand it however , moses ' spirit was revived when a student asked akiva the source of a law , and akiva replied '' a law to moses at sinai '' menahot 29b this story gives a picture of akiva 's activity as the father of rabbinic judaism tinnius rufus asked : '' which is the more beautiful—god 's work or man 's ? '' akiva replied : '' undoubtedly man 's work is the better , for while nature at god 's command supplies us only with the raw material , human skill enables us to elaborate the same according to the requirements of art and good taste numbers rabbah 9:34 it is related that , during his stay in rome , akiva became intimately acquainted with the jewish proselyte ketia bar shalom , a very influential roman ( according to some scholars identical with flavius clemens , domitian 's nephew keti ’ a bar shalom ) , who , before his execution for pleading the cause of the jews , bequeathed to akiva all his possessions commentaries to nedarim 50a this was not the only occasion on which akiva was made to feel the truth of his favorite maxim ( '' whatever god does , he does for the best '' ) berachot 60b another legend according to which the gates of the infernal regions opened for akiva is analogous to the more familiar tale that he entered paradise and was allowed to leave it unscathed when , in the course of his travels , he reached the place , akiva sought for information concerning the man 's family akiva , however , was not to be turned from his purpose ; he sought the son of the tax-gatherer and labored long and assiduously in teaching him the word of god
