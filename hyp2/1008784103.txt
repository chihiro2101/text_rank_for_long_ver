photon mapping can trace the paths of individual photons to model where these concentrated patches of light will appear photon mapping is particularly adept at handling this effect because the algorithm reflects photons from one surface to another based on that surface 's bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( brdf ) , and thus light from one object striking another is a natural result of the method finally , if the photon is transmitting , a function for its direction is given depending upon the nature of the transmission as long as a ray does not intersect another object , the light source is used to calculate the direct illumination for soft indirect illumination , radiance is calculated using the photon map directly in order to calculate surface radiance at an intersection point , one of the cached photon maps is used instead of simply sending out photons in random directions , they are sent in the direction of a known object that is a desired photon manipulator to either focus or diffuse the light it would seem that emitting more photons in a specific direction would cause a higher density of photons to be stored in the photon map around the position where the photons hit , and thus measuring this density would give an inaccurate value for irradiance during the photon mapping process , when a photon strikes a surface , in addition to the usual operations performed , a shadow photon is emitted in the same direction the original photon came from that goes all the way through the object then during the direct illumination calculation , instead of sending out a ray from the surface to the light that tests collisions with objects , the photon map is queried for shadow photons essentially , the filter gives weight to photons ' contributions to radiance depending on how far they are from ray-surface intersections
