was adopted as the official irish title of the irish free state when it was established at the end of the irish war of independence , although this free state was not a republic but a form of constitutional monarchy within the british empire by this declaration they claimed to establish an independent state called the '' irish republic '' and proclaimed that the leaders of the rebellion would serve as the '' provisional government of the irish republic '' until it became possible to elect a national parliament a compromise was reached at the 1917 ard fheis ( party conference ) , where it was agreed that the party would pursue the establishment of an independent republic in the short term , until the irish people could be given the opportunity to decide on the form of government they preferred it also said it would boycott the british parliament and instead unilaterally establish a new irish assembly in dublin the decision to establish a republic in 1919 , rather than any other form of government , was significant because it amounted to a complete repudiation of all constitutional ties with great britain , and set the party against any compromise that might involve initial self-government under the home rule act 1914 or continued membership of the british empire one obstacle to this decision—that the unionists of the north-east had long indicated that they would never participate in any form of a republic—was left unresolved , the six north-eastern counties remaining part of the united kingdom under the government of ireland act 1920 , and later the anglo-irish treaty in august 1921 , it was changed again with the title president of the republic used , suggesting a position of head of state later the english title '' president of dáil éireann '' also came to be used for the same post , especially during president de valera 's tour of the united states on 26 august 1921 , de valera had the dáil appoint him to the new post of '' president of the republic '' , so that he would be regarded as the head of state in the forthcoming treaty negotiations the military branch of the irish republic were the irish volunteers who , in the course of the war of independence , who were formally renamed the '' irish republican army '' to reflect their status as the national army of the declared republic the irish republic had some of the attributes of a functioning state ; a ministry ( with a head of state in the latter stages ) , a parliament , a courts system , a police force and a constitution at the height of the irish war of independence , as atrocities committed by the black and tans reached such a scale as to result in the burning of the city of cork ( leading to widespread criticism in the united states and from king george v ) , the republican police and dáil courts reached their zenith , and senior barristers who had qualified within the british courts system also represented defendants in the dáil courts in declaring independence unilaterally for the whole island , the new republic had denied '' equal weight '' to the wishes of britain or the irish loyalists the obvious problem was that the irish republic 's declaration of independence of january 1919 was hostile to britain , which was one of the four main powers arranging terms at versailles the british view was that the 69 new sinn féin members of parliament had chosen not to take their seats at westminster ( to the relief of the conservative party ) , and that an irish settlement would be arranged after the more important treaties with the former central powers had been signed off , involving sinn féin as the representatives of the majority , whether or not it had proclaimed a republic because its original contents were not seen as workable , the government under david lloyd george abandoned plans to amend the third home rule act enacted in 1914 , having called the irish convention in 1917–18 the british cabinet started in september 1919 to work from walter long 's 1918 proposals , and in december 1920 they enacted the government of ireland act 1920 while rejecting the right of the british parliament to legislate for ireland , sinn féin took the opportunity of the two general elections in may 1921 , one in the north and one in the south , to seek a renewed mandate for the republic he had been invited as : '' the chosen leader of the great majority in southern ireland '' , but tried to extend this to a british recognition of the republic however , the british view was that they were not envoys , and they recognised them only as elected members of parliament representing those irish people who wanted independence in one form or another by september , the british called for a conference with the envoys '' to ascertain how the association of ireland with the community of nations known as the british empire can best be reconciled with irish national aspirations '' each side in the 1921 negotiations used sufficiently elastic language to enable the republic 's delegates to suggest that what was taking place was inter-state negotiations , while allowing the british government to suggest that it was an internal united kingdom of great britain and ireland matter it was : passed by dáil éireann , to satisfy the belief in the republic 's supporters that it was a state and its parliament was sovereign ; passed by the united kingdom , to satisfy british constitutional theory that a treaty had been negotiated between his majesty 's government and his majesty 's subjects in ireland ; passed by the house of commons of southern ireland , to reflect the belief in british constitutional law that ireland already possessed a home rule parliament finally , the two structures of government ( the british government 's administration in dublin castle and the republic 's ) began a process of convergence , to cover the year until the coming into force of the new irish free state right by approving the anglo-irish treaty on 7 january 1922 and the constitution of the irish free state in october 1922 the dáil agreed to the replacement of the republic with the system of constitutional monarchy of the irish free state cosgrave assumed both leadership positions simultaneously and so the two most important offices effectively became one , producing a unique constitutional hybrid ; a crown-appointed prime minister and a president of a republic on 6 december 1922 , the constitution of the irish free state came into effect and the institutions of both the irish republic and the provisional government ceased to exist in particular the anti-treaty faction objected to the continued role in the irish constitution that would be granted to the british monarch under the irish free state '' opponents of the treaty refused to recognise either the provisional government or , when it was established , the irish free state , insisting that the irish republic continued to exist as a entity their line of authority included some tds but also the army executive of the ira which decided in early 1922 that it , and no longer the dáil , was the only body loyal to the republic the anti-treaty faction also refused to recognise the third dáil elected in june 1922 , as the second dáil had not met to dissolve itself formally ( though the '' declaration of election '' on 19 may , which gave dates for nominations and the election , was not opposed at the time ) the irish republican army ultimately ceased military operations against ireland in 1948 , but continued to consider itself the legitimate government of ireland the pira conducted a campaign of bombings and shootings in northern ireland from the late 1960s until 1998 , and its political wing , the modern sinn féin party , used to insist that the irish republic was still legally in existence , with the provisional ira as its national army , and the ira army council ireland 's sole legitimate government
