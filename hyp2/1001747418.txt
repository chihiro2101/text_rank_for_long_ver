although a molten aluminium salt could be used instead , aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 & nbsp ; °c so electrolysing it is impractical in the hall–héroult process the following simplified reactions take place at the carbon electrodes : cathode : anode : overall : in reality , much more carbon dioxide is formed at the anode than co : pure cryolite has a melting point of besides having a relatively low melting point , cryolite is used as an electrolyte because , among other things , it also dissolves alumina well , conducts electricity , dissociates electrolytically at higher voltage than alumina , and also has a lower density than aluminum at the temperatures required by the electrolysis the liquid aluminium is removed from the cell via a siphon every 1 to 3 days in order to avoid having to use extremely high temperature valves and pumps agitation of the molten material in the cell increases its production rate at the expense of an increase in cryolite impurities in the product in non-agitating static pool cells , the impurities either rise to the top of the metallic aluminium , or sink to the bottom , leaving high-purity aluminium in the middle area the materials most often used in anodes , coke and pitch resin , are mainly residues from the petroleum industry and need to be of high enough purity so no impurities end up into the molten aluminum or the electrolyte the anode is contained within a frame and , as the bottom of the anode turns mainly into co 2 during the electrolysis , the anode loses mass and , being amorphous , it slowly sinks within its frame the lost heat from the smelting operation is used to bake the briquettes into the carbon form required for the reaction with alumina prebaked anodes are baked in very large gas-fired ovens at high temperature before being lowered by various heavy industrial lifting systems into the electrolytic solution prebake technology also has much lower risk of the anode effect ( see below ) , but cells using it are more expensive to build and labor-intensive to use , as each prebaked anode in a cell needs to be removed and replaced once it has been used the anode effect is a situation where too many gas bubbles form at the bottom of the anode and join together , forming a layer this increases the resistance of the cell , because smaller areas of the electrolyte touch the anode these areas of the electrolyte and anode heat up when the density of the electric current of the cell focuses to go through only them this heats up the gas layer and causes it to expand , thus further reducing the surface area where electrolyte and anode are in contact with each other aluminum produced via the hall–héroult process , in combination with cheaper electric power , helped make aluminium ( and incidentally magnesium ) an inexpensive commodity rather than a precious metal
