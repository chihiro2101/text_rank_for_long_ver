he later got a job with baguès , an electrical engineering company in paris blériot set about courting her with the same determination that he would later bring to his aviation experiments , and on 21 february 1901 the couple were married the disappointment of the failure of his aircraft was compounded by the success of alberto santos dumont later that day , when he managed to fly his 14-bis a distance of , winning the aéro club de france prize for the first flight of over 100 metres the first of these , the canard ( aeronautics ) blériot v , was first tried on 21 march 1907 , elliott 2000 , p two further ground trials , also damaging the aircraft , were undertaken , followed by another attempt on 5 april this was followed by the blériot vi , a tandem wing design , first tested on 7 july , when the aircraft failed to lift off further successful flights took place that month , and by 25 july he had managed a flight of 150 & nbsp ; m ( 490 & nbsp ; ft ) on 6 december blériot managed two flights of over 500 metres , including a successful u-turn this was the most impressive achievement to date of any of the french pioneer aviators , causing patrick alexander to write to major baden baden-powell , president of the royal aeronautical society , '' i got back from paris last night i think blériot with his new machine is leading the way '' after modifications , it proved successful , and on 31 october 1908 he succeeded in making a cross-country flight , making a round trip from toury to arteny and back , a total distance of the first two of the designs , which used antoinette engines , never flew , possibly because at this time , blériot severed his connection with the antoinette company because the company had begun to design and construct aircraft as well as engines , presenting blériot with a conflict of interests the type xi was initially powered by a rep engine and was first flown with this engine on 18 january 1909 , sanger 2008 , p but although the aircraft flew well , after a very short time in the air , the engine began to overheat , leading blériot to get in touch with alessandro anzani , who had developed a successful motorcycle engine and had subsequently entered the aero-engine market this was shortly followed by the blériot xii , a high-wing two-seater monoplane first flown on 21 may , and for a while blériot concentrated on flying this machine , flying it with a passenger on 2 july , and on 12 july making the world 's first flight with two passengers , one of whom was santos dumont at the end of july he took part in an aviation meet at douai , where he made a flight lasting over 47 minutes in the type xii on 3 july : the following day he flew the type xi for 50 minutes at another meet at juvisy , and on 13 july , he made a cross-country flight of from etampes to orléans after half an hour , one of his shoes had been burnt through and he was in considerable pain , but nevertheless continued his flight until engine failure ended the flight three days later , on 19 july , he informed the daily mail of his intention to make an attempt to win the thousand-pound prize offered by the paper for a successful crossing of the english channel in a heavier-than-air aircraft the daily mail prize was first announced in october 1908 , with a prize of £500 being offered for a flight made before the end of the year blériot , who intended to fly across the channel in his type xi monoplane , had three rivals for the prize , the most serious being hubert latham , a french national of english extraction flying an antoinette iv monoplane also wilbur had already amassed a fortune in prize money for altitude and duration flights and had secured sales contracts for the wright flyer with the french , italians , british and germans ; his tour in europe was essentially complete by the summer of 1909 hallion ; c.1978 by the smithsonian institution latham arrived in calais in early july , and set up his base at sangatte in the semi-derelict buildings which had been constructed for a 1881 attempt to dig a tunnel under the channel the following day a replacement aircraft for latham was delivered from the antoinette factory his spirits revived , however , and by half past three , his wife alice had been put on board the destroyer escopette , which was to escort the flight at 4:15 am , 25 july , watched by an excited crowd , blériot made a short trial flight in his type xi , and then , on a signal that the sun had risen ( the competition rules required a flight between sunrise and sunset ) , he took off at 4:41 to attempt the crossing '' the new york times , 24 july 2009 the grey line of the english coast , however , came into sight on his left ;
