in this , he joins the ranks of many other heroes of serbian poetry who fought against turkish oppression and are claimed to have been descendants of a dragon in many sources he is mentioned as a son-in-law of prince lazar , which would make him a brother-in-law to vuk branković , another serbian high ranking nobleman and a prominent antagonist in epic traditions concerning the battle of kosovo according to this legend , miloš was accused by branković , at the eve of the battle of kosovo of intent to betray his lord lazar and switch sides mid battle the historian rade mihaljčić suggests that the cult was a popular movement which originated among the serbs south of the sava and danube during the ottoman period later in the same century , the heroic figure of miloš was given a national boost in the epic poem the mountain wreath ( 1847 ) by petar ii petrović-njegoš , prince-bishop of montenegro in the late 1980s , religious nationalists began to breathe further life into the figure of miloš and the kosovo myth
