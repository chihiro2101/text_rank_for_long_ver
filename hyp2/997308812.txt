although the rate of turnover of isotopic oxygen in hydroxyapatite is not fully known , it is assumed to be similar to that of collagen ; approximately 10 years consequently , should an individual remain in a region for 10 years or longer , the isotopic oxygen ratios in the bone hydroxyapatite would reflect the oxygen ratios present in that region as such , isotopic analysis makes use of the more resistant phosphate groups , rather than the less abundant hydroxyl group or the more likely diagenetic carbonate groups present carbon , nitrogen and zinc isotope ratios are used to investigate the diets of past people ; these isotopic systems can be used with others , such as strontium or oxygen , to answer questions about population movements and cultural interactions , such as trade examining the carbon 12/carbon 13 isotope ratio , it is possible to determine whether animals and humans ate predominantly c3 or c4 plants carbon isotope ratios can also be used to distinguish between marine , freshwater , and terrestrial food sources particularly in the bronze age mediterranean , lead isotope analysis has been a useful tool for determining the sources of metals and an important indicator of trade patterns the ratio of the two isotopes may be altered by biological and geophysical processes , and these differences can be utilized in a number of ways by ecologists certain isotopes can signify distinct primary producers forming the bases of food webs and trophic level positioning analysis is usually done using a mass spectrometer , detecting small differences between gaseous elements the main advantage to using stable isotope analysis as opposed to stomach content observations is that no matter what the status is of the animal 's stomach ( empty or not ) , the isotope tracers in the tissues will give us an understanding of its trophic position and food source the three major isotopes used in aquatic ecosystem food web analysis are 13 c , 15 n and 34 s while all three indicate information on trophic dynamics , it is common to perform analysis on at least two of the previously mentioned 3 isotopes for better understanding of marine trophic interactions and for stronger results the transfer of 13 c through trophic levels remains relatively the same , except for a small increase ( an enrichment 13 c between animals indicate that they have different food sources or that their food webs are based on different primary producers ( i.e these include isotopes within dissolved inorganic carbon pools ( dic ) may vary with temperature and location and that growth rates of phytoplankton may affect their uptake of the isotopes nitrogen isotopes indicate the trophic level position of organisms ( reflective of the time the tissue samples were taken ) in addition to trophic positioning of organisms , Î´ 15 n values have become commonly used in distinguishing between land derived and natural sources of nutrients this method of identifying high levels of nitrogen input is becoming a more and more popular method in attempting to monitor nutrient input into estuaries and coastal ecosystems a study on the isotope ratios of tissues from plants growing within a small area in texas found tissues from cam plants were enriched in deuterium relative to c4 plants hydrogen isotope ratios in animal tissue reflect diet , including drinking water , and have been used to study bird migration and aquatic food webs these differences in isotopic ratio are then biologically 'set ' in our hair as it grows and it has therefore become possible to identify recent geographic histories by the analysis of hair strands researchers have also shown that analysis of the 12 c/ 13 c ratios can locate the country of origin for a given explosive in isotope hydrology , stable isotopes of water ( 2 h and 18 o ) are used to estimate the source , age , and flow paths of water flowing through ecosystems the ratio of 18 o to 16 o in ice and deep sea cores is temperature dependent , and can be used as a proxy measure for reconstructing climate change
