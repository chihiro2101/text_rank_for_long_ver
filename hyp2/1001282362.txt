kohlberg found a scholarly approach that gave a central place to the individual 's reasoning in moral decision making sequence in the development of moral thought he also outlined how educators can influence moral development without indoctrination and how public school can be engaged in moral education consistent with the united states constitution kohlberg also held that there are common patterns of social life , observed in universally occurring social institutions , such as families , peer groups , structures and procedures for clan or society decision-making , and cooperative work for mutual defense and sustenance each stage of moral cognitive development is the realization in conscious thought of the relations of justice , care , and respect exhibited in a wider circle of social relations , including narrower circles within the wider kohlberg 's theory holds that moral reasoning , which is the basis for ethical behavior , has six identifiable developmental constructive stages â€“ each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than the last kohlberg suggested that the higher stages of moral development provide the person with greater capacities/abilities in terms of decision making and so these stages allow people to handle more complex dilemmas in studying these , kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment beyond the ages originally studied earlier by piaget , who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages expanding considerably upon this groundwork , it was determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice and that its development continued throughout the life span , even spawning dialogue of philosophical implications of such research these stages heavily influenced others and have been utilized by others like james rest in making the defining issues test in 1979 kohlberg is most well known among psychologists for his research in moral psychology , but among educators he is known for his applied work of moral education in schools the three major contributions kohlberg made to moral education were the use of moral exemplars , dilemma discussions , and just community schools recent research in moral psychology has brought back the value of witnessing moral exemplars in action or learning about their stories dilemma discussions in schools was another method proposed by kohlberg to increase moral reasoning results of this and other studies using similar methods found that moral discussion does increase moral reasoning and works best if the individual in question is in discussion with a person who is using reasoning that is just one stage above their own the final method kohlberg used for moral education was known as '' just communities '' i and ii , the philosophy of moral development ( 1981 ) and the psychology of moral development ( 1984 ) , published by harper & row other works published by kohlgainz or about kohlberg 's theories and research include consensus and controversy , the meaning and measurement of moral development , lawrence kohlberg 's approach to moral education and child psychology and childhood education : a cognitive developmental view carol gilligan , a fellow researcher of kohlberg 's in the studies of moral reasoning that led to kohlberg 's developmental stage theory , suggested that to make moral judgments based on optimizing concrete human relations is not necessarily a lower stage of moral judgment than to consider objective principles postulating that women may develop an empathy-based ethic with a different , but not lower structure than that kohlberg had described , gilligan wrote in a different voice , a book that founded a new movement of ethics of care that initially found strong resonance among feminists and later achieved wider recognition kohlberg 's response to carol gilligan 's criticism was that he agreed with her that there is a care moral orientation that is distinct from a justice moral orientation , but he disagreed with her claim that women scored lower than men on measures of moral developmental stages because they are more inclined to use care orientation rather than a justice orientation san francisco , harper & row he then proposed a model of the relationship between moral judgments and moral action according to kohlberg , an individual first interprets the situation using their moral reasoning , which is influenced by their moral stage and sub-stage if this model is true then it would explain why research was having a hard time finding a direct relationship between moral reason and moral behavior the high use of intuition directly challenges the place of reason in moral experience this expanding of the moral domain from reason has raised questions that perhaps morality research is entering areas of inquiry that are not considered real morality , which was a concern of kohlberg when he first started his research the long-term effects of the infection and the medications took their toll , and kohlberg 's health declined as he also engaged in increasingly demanding professional work , including '' just community '' prison and school moral education programs
