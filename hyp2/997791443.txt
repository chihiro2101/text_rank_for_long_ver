the l2 cache ran at half the processor 's clock frequency , unlike the pentium pro , whose off die l2 cache ran at the same frequency as the processor intel improved 16-bit code execution performance on the pentium ii , an area in which the pentium pro was at a notable handicap , by adding segment register caches to compensate for the slower l2 cache , the pentium ii featured 32 & nbsp ; kb of l1 cache , double that of the pentium pro , as well as 4 write buffers ( vs all klamath and some early deschutes pentium iis use a combined l2 cache controller / tag ram chip that only allows for 512 & nbsp ; mb to be cached ; while more ram could be installed in theory , this would result in very slow performance presumably , intel put this limitation deliberately in place to distinguish the pentium ii from the more upmarket pentium pro line , which has a full 4 & nbsp ; gb cacheable area the '82459ad ' revision of the chip on some 333 & nbsp ; mhz and all 350 & nbsp ; mhz and faster pentium iis lifted this restriction and also offered a full 4 gb cacheable area the original klamath pentium ii microprocessor ( intel product code 80522 ) ran at 233 , 266 , and 300 & nbsp ; mhz and was produced in a 0.35 μm process on july 14 , 1997 , intel announced a version of the pentium ii klamath with 2× 72-bit ecc l2 cache for entry-level servers , as opposed to the 2× 64-bit non-ecc l2 cache on regular models the 333 & nbsp ; mhz variant was the final pentium cpu that used the older 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus ; all subsequent deschutes-core models used a 100 & nbsp ; mhz fsb towards the end of its design life , deschutes chips capable of 500 & nbsp ; mhz within intel cooling and design specifications were produced overclockers , upon learning of this , purchased the units in question and ran them well over 500 & nbsp ; mhz ; most notably , when overclocking , the final batch of '' 333 mhz '' cpus were capable of speeds much higher than cpus sold at 350 , 400 , or 450 & nbsp ; mhz in 1998 , the 0.25 μm deschutes core was utilized in the creation of the pentium ii overdrive processor , which was aimed at allowing corporate pentium pro users to upgrade their aging servers combining the deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 & nbsp ; kb full-speed l2 cache chip from the pentium ii xeon into a socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 & nbsp ; mhz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus this combination brought together some of the more attractive aspects of the pentium ii and the pentium ii xeon : mmx support/improved 16-bit performance and full-speed l2 cache , respectively in intel 's '' family/model/stepping '' scheme , the pentium ii overdrive cpu identifies itself as family 6 , model 3 , though this is misleading , as it is not based on the family 6/model 3 klamath core the 0.25 & nbsp ; μm tonga core was the first mobile pentium ii and had all of the features of the desktop models later , in 1999 , the 0.25 ; 0.18 ( 400 & nbsp ; mhz ) μm dixon core with 256 & nbsp ; kb of on-die full speed cache was produced for the mobile market l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb external chip on cpu module running at 100 % of cpu speed socket : socket 8 front-side bus : 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz , gtl+ vcore : 3.1–3.3 & nbsp ; v ( has on-board voltage regulator ) fabrication : 0.25 & nbsp ; μm based on the deschutes-generation pentium ii first release : 1998 supports mmx technology the sspec number sl2ke denotes a pentium ii overdrive sold with an integrated heatsink/fan combination for socket 8
