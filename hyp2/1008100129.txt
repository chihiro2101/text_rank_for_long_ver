classical and neoclassical economics regard capital as one of the factors of production ( alongside the other factors : land and labour ) marxian economics distinguishes between different forms of capital : constant capital , which refers to capital goods variable capital , which refers to labor-inputs , where the cost is '' variable '' based on the amount of wages and salaries paid during an employee 's contract/employment , fictitious capital , which refers to intangible representations or abstractions of physical capital , such as stocks , bonds and securities ( or '' tradable paper wealth '' ) earlier illustrations often described capital as physical items , such as tools , buildings , and vehicles that are used in the production process for example , investment in skills and education can be viewed as building up human capital or knowledge capital , and investments in intellectual property can be viewed as building up intellectual capital detailed classifications of capital that have been used in various theoretical or applied uses generally respect the following division : financial capital , which represents obligations , and is liquidated as money for trade , and owned by legal entities natural capital , which is inherent in ecologies and which increases the supply of human wealth social capital , which in private enterprise is partly captured as goodwill or brand value , but is a more general concept of inter-relationships between human beings having money-like value that motivates actions in a similar fashion to paid compensation various theories use names like knowledge or intellectual capital to describe similar concepts but these are not strictly defined as in the academic definition and have no widely agreed accounting treatment it is used in technical economics to define “ balanced growth ” , which is the goal of improving human capital as much as economic capital however , this increasingly distinguishes means of capital investment , and collection of potential rewards for patent , copyright ( creative or individual capital ) , and trademark ( social trust or social capital ) instruments within classical economics , adam smith ( wealth of nations , book ii , chapter 1 ) distinguished fixed capital from circulating capital economist henry george argued that financial instruments like stocks , bonds , mortgages , promissory notes , or other certificates for transferring wealth is not really capital , because '' their economic value merely represents the power of one class to appropriate the earnings of another '' and '' their increase or decrease does not affect the sum of wealth in the community '' on the other hand , constant capital refers to investment in non-human factors of production , such as plant and machinery , which marx takes to contribute only its own replacement value to the commodities it is used to produce investment is closely related to saving , though it is not the same in traditional economic analysis individual capital is more usually called labour this theory is the basis of triple bottom line accounting and is further developed in ecological economics , welfare economics and the various theories of green economics
