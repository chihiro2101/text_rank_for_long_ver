transform boundaries are also known as conservative plate boundaries because they involve no addition or loss of lithosphere at the earth 's surface slip along transform faults does not increase the distance between the ridges it separates ; the distance remains constant in earthquakes because the ridges are spreading centers both types of fault are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement ; nevertheless , transform faults always end at a junction with another plate boundary , while transcurrent faults may die out without a junction with another fault although separated only by tens of kilometers , this separation between segments of the ridges causes portions of the seafloor to push past each other in opposing directions instead of the ridges moving away from each other , as they do in other strike-slip faults , transform-fault ridges remain in the same , fixed locations , and the new ocean seafloor created at the ridges is pushed away from the ridge finally , fracturing along these planes forms transform faults fracture zones represent the previously active transform-fault lines , which have since passed the active transform zone and are being pushed toward the continents in his work on transform-fault systems , geologist tuzo wilson said that transform faults must be connected to other faults or tectonic-plate boundaries on both ends ; because of that requirement , transform faults can grow in length , keep a constant length , or decrease in length wilson described six types of transform faults : growing length : in situations where a transform fault links a spreading center and the upper block of a subduction zone or where two upper blocks of subduction zones are linked , the transform fault itself will grow in length finally , when two upper subduction plates are linked there is no change in length this is due to the plates moving parallel with each other and no new lithosphere is being created to change that length in time as the plates are subducted , the transform fault will decrease in length until the transform fault disappears completely , leaving only two subduction zones facing in opposite directions
