ranke wrote largely on the history of early modern europe , using the diplomatic archives of the european powers ( particularly the venetians ) to construct a detailed understanding of the history of europe wie es eigentlich gewesen ( '' as it actually happened '' ) ranke saw diplomatic history as the most important kind of history to write because of his idea of the '' primacy of foreign affairs '' ( primat der aussenpolitik ) , arguing that the concerns of international relations drive the internal development of the state a notable event in diplomatic history occurred in 1910 when the french government start to publish all of the archives relating to the war of 1870 ranke 's understanding of the dominance of foreign policy , and hence an emphasis on diplomatic history , remained the dominant paradigm in historical writing through the first half of the twentieth century this emphasis , combined with the effects of the war guilt clause in the treaty of versailles ( 1919 ) which ended the first world war , led to a huge amount of historical writing on the subject of the origins of the war of 1914 , with the involved governments printing huge , carefully edited , collections of documents and numerous historians writing multi-volume histories of the origins of the war taylor , struggle for mastery in europe 1848-1918 ( oxford up , 1954 ) in the interwar period , most diplomatic historians tended to blame all of the great powers of 1914 for the first world war , arguing that the war was in effect everybody 's responsibility historian muriel chamberlain notes that after the first world war : : diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation , at once the most important , most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies muriel e chamberlain , pax britannica ' ? british foreign policy 1789-1914 ( 1988 ) p 1 she adds that after 1945 , the trend reversed , allowing political , intellectual and social history to displace diplomatic history for the first half of the 20th century , most diplomatic history working within the narrow confines of the primat der aussenpolitik approach was very narrowly concerned with foreign-policy making elites with little reference to broader historical forces sir winston churchill 's multi-volume the second world war , especially the first volume the gathering storm ( 1948 ) set the framework and the interpretation for much later historiography in recent years the debates regarding the 1930s have continued , but new approaches are in use , such as an analysis in terms of britain 's national identity a group of french historians centered around pierre renouvin ( 1893-1974 ) and his protégés jean-baptiste duroselle and maurice baumont started a new type of international history in the 1950s that included taking into account what renouvin called ( profound forces ) such as the influence of domestic politics on french foreign policy peter jackson , “ post-war politics and the historiography of french strategy and diplomacy before the second world war '' history compass , volume 4/5 , 2006 pp 870-95 s wehler , who favored the primat der innenpolitik approach , for his part contended that diplomatic history should be treated as a sub-branch of social history , calling for theoretically-based research , and argued that the real focus should be on the study of the society in question a notable example of the primat der innenpolitik approach was the claim by the british marxist historian timothy mason who claimed that the launch of world war ii in 1939 was best understood as a “ barbaric variant of social imperialism ” kaillis , aristotle fascist ideology , london : routledge , 2000 page 7 mason argued that “ nazi germany was always bent at some time upon a major war of expansion ” kaillis , aristotle fascist ideology , london : routledge , 2000 page 165 however , mason argued that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures , especially as relating to a failing economy , and had nothing to do with what hitler wanted kaillis , aristotle fascist ideology , london : routledge , 2000 pages 165-166 mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless “ smash and grab ” foreign policy of seizing territory in eastern europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in germany kaillis , aristotle fascist ideology , london : routledge , 2000 page 166 mason 's theory of a '' flight into war '' being imposed on hitler generated much controversy , and in the 1980s he conducted a series of debates with economic historian richard overy over this matter “ debate : germany , ` domestic crisis ’ and the war in 1939 ” from the origins of the second world war edited by patrick finney , edward arnold : london , united kingdom , 1997 page 102 overy argued that there was a major difference between economic pressures inducted by the problems of the four year plan , and economic motives to seize raw materials , industry and foreign reserve of neighboring states as a way of accelerating the four year plan overy , richard “ germany , ‘ domestic crisis ’ and war in 1939 ” from the third reich edited by christian leitz , blackwell : oxford , 1999 pages 117-118 moreover , overy asserted that the repressive capacity of the german state as a way of dealing with domestic unhappiness was somewhat downplayed by mason , the encyclopedia of historians and historical writing ( 1999 ) pp 314-165 a sign of the changing times was the rise to prominence of such diplomatic historians such as the japanese historian chihiro hosoya , the british historian ian nish , and the american historian akira iriye , which was the first time that asian specialists became noted diplomatic historians the vietnam war led to the rise of a revisionist school in the united states , which led many american historians such as gabriel kolko and william appleman williams to reject traditional diplomatic history in favor of a primat der innenpolitik approach that saw a widespread examination of the influence of american domestic politics together with various social , economic and cultural forces on foreign-policy making latterly , a third school known as '' neo-orthodox '' whose most prominent
