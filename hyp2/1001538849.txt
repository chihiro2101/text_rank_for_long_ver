in 1928 george gamow derived what is now called the gamow factor , a quantum mechanics formula yielding the probability for two contiguous nuclei to overcome the electrostatic coulomb barrier between them and approach each other closely enough to undergo nuclear reaction due to the strong nuclear force which is effective only at very short distances he defined two processes that he believed to be the sources of energy in stars the first one , the proton-proton chain reaction , is the dominant energy source in stars with masses up to about the mass of the sun hoyle followed that in 1954 with a paper describing how advanced fusion stages within massive stars would synthesize the elements from carbon to iron in mass this review paper collected and refined earlier research into a heavily cited picture that gave promise of accounting for the observed relative abundances of the elements ; but it did not itself enlarge hoyle 's 1954 picture for the origin of primary nuclei as much as many assumed , except in the understanding of nucleosynthesis of those elements heavier than iron by neutron capture the most important reactions in stellar nucleosynthesis : hydrogen fusion : deuterium fusion the proton–proton chain the cno cycle helium fusion : the triple-alpha process the alpha process fusion of heavier elements : lithium burning : a process found most commonly in brown dwarfs carbon-burning process neon-burning process oxygen-burning process silicon-burning process production of elements heavier than iron : neutron capture : the r-process the s-process proton capture : the rp-process the p-process photodisintegration in the cores of lower-mass main-sequence stars such as the sun , the dominant energy production process is the proton–proton chain reaction the proton–proton chain reaction cycle is relatively insensitive to temperature ; a 10 % rise of temperature would increase energy production by this method by 46 % , hence , this hydrogen fusion process can occur in up to a third of the star 's radius and occupy half the star 's mass for stars above 35 % of the sun 's mass , the energy flux toward the surface is sufficiently low and energy transfer from the core region remains by radiative heat transfer , rather than by convective heat transfer about 90 % of the cno cycle energy generation occurs within the inner 15 % of the star 's mass , hence it is strongly concentrated at the core the type of hydrogen fusion process that dominates in a star is determined by the temperature dependency differences between the two reactions the proton–proton chain reaction starts at temperatures about , making it the dominant fusion mechanism in smaller stars this temperature is achieved in the cores of main sequence stars with at least 1.3 times the mass of the sun main sequence stars accumulate helium in their cores as a result of hydrogen fusion , but the core does not become hot enough to initiate helium fusion
