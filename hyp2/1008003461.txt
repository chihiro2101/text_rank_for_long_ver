joseph jacobs schulim ochser 1911 jewish encyclopedia article although it is presented as the original '' book of jasher '' in translations such as that of moses samuel ( 1840 ) , it is not accepted as such in rabbinical judaism , nor does the original hebrew text make such a claim & nbsp ; 1099 , was '' probably written in the 13th century the bible twice quotes from a sefer hayashar , and this midrashic work includes text that fits both biblical references - the reference about the sun and moon found in joshua , and also the reference in 2 samuel ( in the hebrew but not in the septuagint ) to teaching the sons of judah to fight with the bow the earliest extant version of this hebrew midrash was printed in venice in 1625 , and the introduction refers to an earlier 1552 edition in naples , of which neither trace nor other mention has been found the printer yosèf ben samuel claimed the work was copied by a scribe named jacob the son of atyah , from an ancient manuscript whose letters could hardly be made out , sefer ha-yashar '' despite modena 's intervention , the preface to the 1625 version still claims that its original source book came from the ruins of jerusalem in ad 70 , where a roman officer named sidrus allegedly discovered a hebrew scholar hiding in a hidden library although there remains doubt about whether the 1552 '' edition '' in naples was ever truly printed , the study of joseph dan , professor of kabbalah at the hebrew university of jerusalem , in the preface to his 1986 critical edition of the 1625 text joseph sefer hayashar , edited with an introduction , jerusalem : the bialik institute 1986 concludes , from the hebrew used and other indicators , that the work was in fact written in naples in the early 16th century the translator of the 1840 edition was not published , but indicated as an eminent jewish scholar in britain in the comments of one of the four certificating hebraist scholars to the publisher in the preface to the 2nd editions : subsequently , the translator identified himself as moses samuel of liverpool ( 1795–1860 ) , who obtained a copy of the 1625 hebrew edition and became convinced that the core of this work truly was the self-same book of the upright referenced in hebrew scriptures samuel gave the reason his name did not appear on the translation thus : '' i did not put my name to it as my patron and myself differed about its authenticity '' & mdash ; the nyc publisher noah having had a lower opinion of the work 's authenticity than samuel : volume 35 jewish historical society of england 2000 '' ' i did not put my name to it as my patron and myself differed about its authenticity ' , samuel later explained.16 this was odd since noah seems to have had a lower opinion of the work 's authenticity than samuel '' samuel had in fact originally tried to persuade the royal asiatic society at calcutta to publish the work , a fact alluded to obliquely in the preface to noah 's 1840 edition , but eventually samuel sold the work to noah for £150 noah 's 1840 preface contained endorsements by hebrew scholars of the day , all of whom praised the quality of the translation , but these said nothing to indicate they believed it to be the work referred to in joshua and 2 samuel another translation of this book exist , created by reform rabbi and editor , dr browne , known as “ alphabet ” browne , and published in new york in 1876 joseph smith , founder of the latter day saint movement , acquired a copy in 1841 or 1842 and wrote in the september 1 , 1842 edition of the times and seasons , in reference to the patriarch abraham : '' the book of jasher , which has not been disproved as a bad author , says he was cast into the fire of the chaldeans '' some of these scholars suggest that the book likely contains many original portions of the sefer hayashar referenced in the old testament but also has a number of added interpolations the bible has only scant information about pre-flood times , but both the book of jasher and parts of the joseph smith translation of the bible contain additional information , some of which is strikingly similar
