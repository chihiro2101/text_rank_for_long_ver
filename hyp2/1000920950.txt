dorgon was one of the most influential among nurhaci 's sons , and his role was instrumental to the qing occupation of beijing , the capital of the fallen ming dynasty , in 1644 . hearing the news , dorgon 's han chinese advisors hong chengchou and fan wencheng ( 范文程 ; 1597–1666 ) urged the prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen ming empire and claim the mandate of heaven for the qing empire . li zicheng and his defeated troops looted beijing for several days until they left the capital on 4 june with all the wealth they could carry yet , at the same time , as he claimed to have come to avenge the ming empire , dorgon ordered that all claimants to the ming throne ( including descendants of the last ming emperor ) should be executed along with their supporters he had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around beijing , threatening qing control over the capital region 858 and 860 ( '' according to the emperor 's speechwriter , who was probably fan wencheng , dorgon even 'surpassed ' ( guo ) the revered duke of zhou because 'the uncle prince also led the grand army through shanhai pass to smash two hundred thousand bandit soldiers , and then proceeded to take yanjing , pacifying the central xia . in june 1645 , dorgon eventually decreed that all official documents should refer to him as '' imperial uncle prince regent '' ( 皇叔父攝政王 ) , leaving him one step short of claiming the throne for himself to promote ethnic harmony , a 1648 decree from the shunzhi emperor allowed han chinese civilian men to marry manchu women from the banners with the permission of the board of revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners , it was only later in the qing dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with one of dorgon 's first orders in the new qing capital was to vacate the entire northern part of beijing and give it to bannermen , including han chinese bannermen from then on , examinations were held every three years as under the ming empire in the very first imperial examination held under qing rule in 1646 , candidates , most of whom were northern chinese , were asked how the manchus and han chinese could work together for a common purpose . the 1649 examination asked '' how manchus and han chinese could be unified so that their hearts were the same and they worked together without division under the reign of dorgon – whom historians have called '' the mastermind of the qing conquest '' and '' the principal architect of the great manchu enterprise '' – the qing subdued almost all of china and pushed loyalist '' southern ming '' resistance into the far southwestern reaches of china under the pressure of qing armies , li was forced to leave xi'an in february 1645 . from newly captured xi'an , in early april 1645 , the qing forces mounted a campaign against the rich commercial and agricultural region of jiangnan south of the lower yangtze river , where in june 1644 prince of fu had established a regime loyal to the ming . the qing forces soon captured the ming emperor ( who died in beijing the following year ) and seized jiangnan 's main cities , including suzhou and hangzhou ; by early july 1645 , the frontier between the qing empire and the southern ming regime had been pushed south to the qiantang river ( capture of suzhou and hangzhou by early july 1645 ; new frontier ) ; ( capture of the emperor around 17 june , and later death in beijing ) because it united chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against qing rule , the hair cutting command greatly hindered the qing conquest ( '' broke the momentum of the qing conquest '' ) ; ( '' the hair-cutting order , more than any other act , engendered the kiangnan jiangnan resistance of 1645 '' ) ; ( '' the rulers ' effort to make manchus and han one unified 'body ' initially had the effect of unifying upper- and lower-class natives in central and south china against the interlopers '' ) . jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 qing troops for 83 days when the city walls were finally breached on 9 october 1645 , the qing army led by the previous ming defector liu liangzuo ( 劉良佐 ; d after the fall of nanjing , two more members of the ming imperial household created new southern ming regimes : one centred in coastal fujian around the '' longwu emperor '' zhu yujian – a ninth-generation descendant of the hongwu emperor , the ming dynasty 's founder – and one in zhejiang around '' regent '' zhu yihai , prince of lu the two ming regimes fought each other until 20 january 1647 , when a small qing force led by li chengdong captured guangzhou , killed the zhu yuyue , and sent the yongli court fleeing to nanning in guangxi . in may 1648 , however , li mutinied against the qing empire , and the concurrent rebellion of another former ming general in jiangxi helped the yongli emperor to retake most of south china . although dutch traveler johan nieuhof who witnessed the event happened claimed only 8000 people were slaughtered 《广东通志》、《广州市志》 《 '' 庚寅之劫 '' ——1650年广州大屠杀》，大洋網，2010年7月13日。 meanwhile , in october 1646 , qing armies led by hooge reached sichuan , where their mission was to destroy the regime of bandit chief zhang xianzhong also late in 1646 but further north , forces assembled by a muslim leader known in chinese sources as milayin ( 米喇印 ) revolted against qing rule in ganzhou ( gansu ) his death also took place when emperor shunzhi was about 13 , an appropriate age for removing the regency over his head that is , if dorgon had died any earlier , shunzhi would still need a regent to supervise the empire on his behalf in 1651 , dorgon 's political enemies , led by his former co-regent jirgalang , submitted to the shunzhi emperor a long memorial listing a series of crimes committed by dorgon , which included : possession of yellow robes , which were strictly for use only by the emperor ; plotting to seize the throne from the shunzhi emperor by calling himself '' emperor 's father '' ; killing hooge and taking hooge 's wife for himself it is difficult to prove verbal accusations made at the time when all records were ordered to be purged by emperor qianlong in 1778 when he also ordered the rehabilitation of dorgon the last charge that dorgon took hooge 's wife was mostly contrived , as the manchu tradition dating from the 12th century had allowed a male relative to marry the deceased person 's wife almost as a charitable act to save her and her children from being starved to death in the minus 20 , merciless winters of the northeastern tip of china , known nowadays as manchuria in the february 1651 imperial edict trying to justify the ultimate punishment to a dead person as well as a key member of the imperial clan , shunzhi ordered that not only dorgon 's name be removed from the scrolls of the imperial ancestral temple execution of all of dorgon 's heirs was also ordered but intentionally not recorded in official qing history with dodo dying of smallpox a few months prior to the death of dorgon in december 1650 and the death of ajige after he was arrested by jirgalang 's forces and put in jail , the 1651 purge was meant to permanently eliminate the potential that a future prince descending from empress xiaolewu would repeat the two dorgon competitions for succession to the throne happening in 1626 , upon the death of nurhaci , and 1643 , upon the death of hongtaiji in the march 1651 purge of dorgon , shunzhi also ordered that the ancestral temple records be written to indicate that no woman had ever conceived a son for dorgon ( not that all of his sons had died due to infant mortality or some other reasons ) , to conceal this political conspiracy against dorgon and his two biological brothers , who had conquered more than half of china for the young qing empire since 1644 he fled beijing with the active assistance of a key member of the white banner under the command of dorgon when he was alive after successfully escaping execution , the camouflage to re-emerge as a han chinese person was considered perfect , as yuan 袁 ( yuen ) was also the family name of yuan chonghuan 袁崇煥 the han chinese general who fatally wounded nurhaci in the 1626 battle of ningyuan , making it highly unlikely that pursuing forces from the forbidden city would suspect that he and/or his descendants were members of the dorgon clan the village where his descendants have sprang up since 1651 was named '' revelation of the dragon 顯龍 '' , indicating his hope that one day someone in his line would be able to reclaim the throne , which never happened through the remaining years of the qing dynasty after dorgon led manchu and han chinese troops loyal to him into beijing on june 6 , 1644 , he immediately ordered restoration of order , as well as penalties for extortion and corruption activities conducted by any member of the imperial clan and other officials 阎崇年，《清十二帝疑案》 these were policies designed to bolster the rule of the qing conquerors , but which caused considerable disturbance and bloodshed in china , and included : forced head-shaving ( 剃发 ) and adopting manchu clothing ( 易服 ) : chinese men were compelled to shave the front half of their heads and tie their hair in queues after the manchu fashion , on pain of death
