his literary career began in 1783 , when he sold to a publisher the comedy “ the coffee-grounds fortune teller ” ( kofeynitsa ) that he had written at 14 , although in the end it was never published or produced beginning in 1789 , krylov also made three attempts to start a literary magazine , although none achieved a large circulation or lasted more than a year little is known of him in the years immediately after , other than the commonly accepted myth that he wandered from town to town playing cards soon , however , he moved on to st petersburg and returned to play writing with more success , particularly with the productions of “ the fashion shop ” ( modnaya lavka ) and “ a lesson for the daughters ” ( urok dochkam ) krylov 's first collection of fables , 23 in number , appeared in 1809 and met with such an enthusiastic reception that thereafter he abandoned drama for fable-writing from 1812 to 1841 he was employed by the imperial public library , first as an assistant , and then as head of the russian books department , a not very demanding position that left him plenty of time to write portraits of krylov began to be painted almost as soon as the fame of his fables spread , beginning in 1812 with roman m russian academic dictionary later monuments chose to represent individual fables separately from the main statue of the poet so well known were krylov 's fables that readers were immediately alerted by its first line , 'my uncle , of most honest principles' by the time of krylov 's death , 77,000 copies of his fables had been sold in russia , and his unique brand of wisdom and humor has remained popular ever since though he began as a translator and imitator of existing fables , krylov soon showed himself an imaginative , prolific writer , who found abundant original material in his native land and in the burning issues of the day in the case of '' the grandee '' ( 1835 ) , it was only allowed to be published after it became known that krylov had amused the emperor by reading it to him , ralston , p.13 while others did not see the light until long after his death , such as '' the speckled sheep '' , published in 1867 , and '' the feast '' in 1869 krylov 's '' the peasant and the snake '' makes la fontaine 's the farmer and the viper ( vi.13 ) the reference point as it relates how the reptile seeks a place in the peasant 's family , presenting itself as completely different in behaviour from the normal run of snakes napoleon.org the fable of '' the swan , the pike and the crawfish '' , all of them pulling a cart in a different direction , originally commented sceptically on a new phase in the campaign against napoleon in the coalition of 1814 ( although some interpreters tend to see it as an allusion to the endless debates of the state council kriloff 's original fables ) lomonosov porcelain factory this was the perfect choice of subject , since the humour of krylov 's poem centres on their wish to get the seating arrangement right as an aid to their performance illustrated books , on the other hand , have been numerous and at the start of the 20th century the style of other new art movements were applied to the fables wikiart a decade later , when the artistic avant-garde was giving its support to the russian revolution , elements of various schools were incorporated by aleksandr deyneka into a 1922 edition of the fables he was followed by alexander gretchaninov , who set 4 fables after ivan krylov for medium voice and piano ( op.33 ) , which included '' the musicians '' , '' the peasant and the sheep '' , '' the eagle and the bee '' , and '' the bear among the bees '' at about this time too , vladimir rebikov wrote a stage work titled krylov 's fables and made some settings under the title fables in faces ( basni v litsach ) that are reported to have been sergei prokofiev ’ s model for peter and the wolf krylov is sometimes referred to as 'the russian la fontaine ' because , though he was not the first of the russian fabulists , he became the foremost and is the one whose reputation has lasted , but the comparison between the two men can be extended further krylov had learned french while still a child and his early work followed la fontaine closely though he lacked latin , he taught himself koine greek from a new testament in about 1819 , ralston , p.xxxii and so was able to read aesop in the original rather than remaining reliant on la fontaine 's recreations of latin versions the major difference between them , however , was that la fontaine created very few fables of his own , whereas the bulk of krylov 's work after 1809 was either indebted to other sources only for the germ of the idea or the fables were of his invention krylov 's first three fables , published in a moscow magazine in 1806 , followed la fontaine 's wording closely ; the majority of those in his 1809 collection were likewise adaptations of la fontaine thereafter he was more often indebted to la fontaine for themes , although his treatment of the story was independent
