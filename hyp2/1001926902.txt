after two years , he was transferred to a carpenter 's shop followed by a blacksmith 's forge , where at the age of fifteen he began training as a blacksmith bell and sons ltd , isbn during his time at the arsenal , maudslay also worked at the royal foundry , where jan verbruggen had installed an innovative horizontal boring machine in 1772 maudslay acquired such a good reputation that joseph bramah called for his services on the recommendation of one of his employees maudslay designed and made a set of special tools and machines that allowed the lock to be made at an economic price maudslay came up with the idea of a leather cup washer , which gave a perfect seal but offered no resistance to movement when the pressure was released the new hydraulic press worked perfectly thereafter and may not have been the first to combine a lead screw , slide rest , and set of change gears all on one lathe ( jesse ramsden may have done that in 1775 ; evidence is scant ) , roe 1916:38 but he did introduce the three-part combination of lead screw , slide rest , and change gears , sparking a great advance in machine tools and in the engineering use of screw threads following earlier work by samuel bentham , his first major commission was to build a series of 42 woodworking machines to produce wooden rigging blocks ( each ship required thousands ) for the navy under sir marc isambard brunel the machines were installed in the purpose-built portsmouth block mills , which still survive , including some of the original machinery completed for hms dee was the largest marine engine existing at that time the marine engine business was developed by henry 's third son , joseph maudslay ( 1801 - 1861 ) by 1850 the firm had supplied more than two hundred vessels with steam engines , though the firm 's dominance was being challenged by john penn 's trunk engine design after many difficulties this first tunnel under the thames was successfully completed in 1842 the tunnel would not have been possible without the innovative tunneling shield designed by marc brunel and built by maudslay sons & field at their lambeth works near the end of his life maudslay developed an interest in astronomy and began to construct a telescope maudslay played his part in the development of mechanical engineering when it was in its infancy , but he was especially pioneering in the development of machine tools to be used in engineering workshops across the world maudslay 's company was one of the most important british engineering manufactories of the nineteenth century , finally closing in 1904
