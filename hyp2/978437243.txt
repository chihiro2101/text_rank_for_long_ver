the monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the river during this period , the private owners began to use fully rigged sailing ships by the 18th century , the commercial expansion of liverpool and the increase in stage coach traffic from chester spurred the growth of the transportation of passengers and goods across the river the service from new ferry to liverpool was first mentioned in 1774 there was considerable debate as to the best way of boarding a ferry vessel at woodside , a small slipway was built on the beach to allow the boats to berth , and in 1822 the paddle steamer royal mail began commercial operation between liverpool and woodside in 1820 , the birkenhead ferry began operating from a new site just to the south ; this closed in 1870 in 1838 , the monks ferry company began operating rival ferries from a new stone slip and hotel about 400 metres south of woodside , but this service closed in 1878 in 1847 , the first floating landing stage , which rose and fell with the tide so that boats could dock at any time , was opened at liverpool the pontoons were towed into position , moored by chains originally made for the ss great eastern , and linked to the mainland by two double bridges the ferry service at tranmere , which had operated since mediaeval times , closed in 1897 the pier and landing stage at rock ferry was built in 1899 , and birkenhead corporation also operated the ferry service at new ferry they both saw action , which was described on 24 april 1918 by roger keyes , 1st baron keyes of the royal navy in a message to the ferries ' manager : '' i am sure it will interest you to know that your two stout vessels carried bluejackets and marines to zeebrugge , and remained alongside the mole for an hour , greatly contributing to the success of the operation the early incarnations of today 's modern vessels can be seen in some of the early propeller driven ships , mainly the 1906 pair , royal iris and royal daffodil as built , the two ferries still had the wheel at promenade deck level , however this was subsequently moved up onto the bridge so navigation was all on one level on early paddlers , the wheelhouse and side cabs were open largely due to the transition from sail to steam , and most ships at the time had open navigation bridges with the ferries being no different birkenhead did not use flying bridges , instead having a central wheelhouse and two outer navigation boxes which were raised up higher above deck level when the railway tunnels were constructed and opened , the ferry service did suffer somewhat but it always remained popular when the queensway road tunnel opened in 1934 , the ferry service from seacombe lost two million passengers because people started to use the tunnel rather than the ferry the opening of the road tunnel also had an effect on the luggage boats which were introduced in 1879 by this time , new brighton had declined as a tourist destination and coupled with silting problems near the landing stage , the ferry service was withdrawn in 1971 , with the stage and pier subsequently demolished this service was usually operated by the overchurch the ferries also began to operate summer manchester ship canal cruises , a service which had been popular for many year since the canal opened , but declined somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s sailing ships from the tall ships ' race visited the river in august 1984 , which helped bring patronage to 250,000 over four days , a level unseen for forty years as a result , many buses which formerly stopped at the birkenhead woodside bus/ferry terminal were extended into liverpool the royal iris remained in service for nearly 40 years before being sold in 1993 - two years after withdrawal - for use as a floating nightclub the forward saloons also had facility for a bar area and dance floor , which meant the vessels could be used for cruising the two vessels were primarily used on the seacombe - liverpool service , augmenting the new brighton run during the summer seasons the leasowe and egremont were popular ferries with their crews as they had much improved crew accommodation compared to the earlier steamers , where much of the lower deck space was taken up with boilers and machinery she was larger than the dartmouth pair as she had three decks and was designed for the dual role of ferry and cruise service the former royal daffodil ii was converted to a container ship , but still retained its forward section largely in its original condition the current mersey ferries fleet comprises two vessels , based on a similar design by naval architects graham and woolnough of liverpool until 2012 a third ferry , royal daffodil , was also in service in their early years of service both the ferries carried rope fenders to protect the strakes the addition of a totally enclosed bridge meant that there only needed to be one binnacle upon it , whereas on the two sisters there were three , one inside the main wheelhouse and two in the docking/navigation boxes overchurch had a high funnel immediately behind the bridge and also a small bridge deck , giving the appearance of a somewhat forward top-heavy look , as a result the trio of ferries all remained in near constant operation up until 1981 , when cost-cutting measures saw woodchurch withdrawn for almost three years whilst in lay up at clarence dry docks , she was offered for sale , with one prospective buyer hoping to use her to operate cruises around the isle of man she was not sold and after main engine repairs and a full repaint woodchurch returned to service in 1983 , freeing up overchurch to become the primary ferry to be used on a new otterspool service , set up for the 1984 international garden festival they were given new modern interiors and their separate bridge wings and wheel houses were plated over to form one large bridge , although none of the original equipment was removed from the new bridge they entered service by july 1990 in time for the qe2 's first visit to the mersey and also operated the new '' heritage cruises '' she was then moved to the ferries ' regular berth on the east float , where she was used as a stand by vessel and during the busy summer season early birkenhead steamers carried red and black , however this appears to have changed to orange in the 1920s or 1930s and this remained up until the merger of the two fleets under the mpte in 1969 the overchurch was given her major refit in 1998 at lengthline ship repairers in manchester , which resulted in a major rebuilding of all decks and fitting of new engines and navigation equipment the current two ferries have been in service for nearly 60 years and 2019 sees the 60th anniversary of the launching of royal iris of the mersey and the snowdrop the mersey ferries used to operate in fog , however currently the service is usually suspended when visibility is very poor the ferries carried record numbers of passengers , and on the 18–21 july , the tall ships returned to the mersey a combination of the tall ships and the golf open at nearby royal birkdale ensured over 1 million visitors to the city over the weekend , with many of these taking a trip on the famous ferries all three ferries were packed to capacity over the weekend , with the royal daffodil operating a special cruise to witness the parade of sail and departure of the ships on monday 21 july another threat to the ferries ' future is the cost of replacing the current ferries , the oldest ever to ply the river , when required in december 2015 merseytravel announced a 20-year plan for the ferries which included the possible closure of one of the two wirral landing stages ( possibly woodside ) , a later start to commuter services which only operate from seacombe to liverpool , and one or two new vessels with better ability to hold social functions or musical events , a facility not available since the disposal of the 1951 royal iris '' mersey ferry terminal could close , 20-year plan reveals '' , bbc news , 16 december 2015 the mersey ferries long term strategy , whilst currently subject to approval , anticipates that a naval architect will be appointed with the intention of having a new vessel ready for service in 2020–21 the vessel will be used as the main day to day vessel with snowdrop used as a secondary vessel plans were announced in august 2019 for two new low-carbon ferries to be built and for improvement works to take place at seacombe ferry terminal by using a share of a £172m 'transforming cities fund ' , it is hoped that at least one of the two ferries will be in service by 2022
