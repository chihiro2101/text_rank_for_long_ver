this is generally taken as marking the beginning of old english poetry with the norman conquest of england , beginning in 1111 the anglo-saxon language rapidly diminished as a written literary language while anglo-norman or latin was preferred for high culture , english literature by no means died out , and a number of important works illustrate the development of the language around the turn of the 13th century , layamon wrote his brut , based on wace 's 12th century anglo-norman epic of the same name ; layamon 's language is recognisably middle english , though his prosody shows a strong anglo-saxon influence remaining it was with the 14th century that major works of english literature began once again to appear ; these include the so-called pearl poet 's pearl , patience , cleanness , and sir gawain and the green knight ; langland 's political and religious allegory piers plowman ; gower 's confessio amantis ; and the works of chaucer , the most highly regarded english poet of the middle ages , who was seen by his contemporaries as a successor to the great tradition of virgil and dante the rise of scottish poetry began with the writing of the kingis quair by james i of scotland henryson and douglas introduced a note of almost savage satire , which may have owed something to the gaelic bards , while douglas ' eneados , a translation into middle scots of virgil 's aeneid , was the first complete translation of any major work of classical antiquity into an anglic languages caxton also printed the works of chaucer and gower and these books helped establish the idea of a native poetic tradition that was linked to its european counterparts in addition , the writings of english humanists like thomas more and thomas elyot helped bring the ideas and attitudes associated with the new learning to an english audience thomas wyatt ( 1503–42 ) , one of the earliest english renaissance poets he was responsible for many innovations in english poetry , and alongside henry howard , earl of surrey ( 1516/1517–47 ) introduced the sonnet from italy into england in the early 16th century elizabethan literature refers to bodies of work produced during the reign of queen elizabeth i ( 1558–1603 ) the introduction and adaptation of themes , models and verse forms from other european traditions and classical literature , the elizabethan song tradition , the emergence of a courtly poetry often centred around the figure of the monarch and the growth of a verse-based drama are among the most important of these developments by the end of the 16th century , a new generation of composers , including john dowland , william byrd , orlando gibbons , thomas weelkes and thomas morley were helping to bring the art of elizabethan song to an extremely high musical level however , much metrical experimentation took place during the period , and many of the songs , in particular , departed widely from the iambic norm the explorations of love found in the sonnets of william shakespeare and the poetry of walter raleigh and others also implies a courtly audience it remained common for poets of the period to write on themes from classical mythology ; shakespeare 's venus and adonis and the christopher marlowe/george chapman hero and leander are examples of this kind of work english renaissance poetry after the elizabethan poetry can be seen as belonging to one of three strains ; the metaphysical poets , the cavalier poets and the school of spenser john milton ( 1608–74 ) is considered one of the greatest english poets , and wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his most renowned epic poems were written in the restoration period , including paradise lost ( 1667 ) the early 17th century saw the emergence of this group of poets who wrote in a witty , complicated style the metaphysical poets went out of favour in the 18th century but began to be read again in the victorian era another important group of poets at this time were the cavalier poets they were an important group of writers , who came from the classes that supported king charles i during the wars of the three kingdoms ( 1639–51 ) john milton 's paradise lost ( 1667 ) , a story of fallen pride , was the first major poem to appear in england after the restoration one of the greatest english poets , john milton ( 1608–1674 ) , wrote during this period of religious and political instability he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his major epic poems were written in the restoration period some of milton 's important poems , were written before the restoration ( see above ) '' milton , john – introduction '' , contemporary literary criticism the 18th century is sometimes called the augustan age , and contemporary admiration for the classical world extended to the poetry of the time in the past decades there has been substantial scholarly and critical work done on women poets of the long 18th century : first , to reclaim them and make them available in contemporary editions in print or online , and second , to assess them and position them within a literary tradition see also : romantic literature in english ; english romantic sonnets the last quarter of the 18th century was a time of social and political turbulence , with american revolution , france , ireland and elsewhere the romantics , with the partial exception of byron , rejected the poetic ideals of the 18th century , and each of them returned to milton for inspiration , though each drew something different from milton attempting to express the '' language of the common man '' , wordsworth and his fellow romantic poets focused on employing poetic language for a wider audience , countering the mimetic , tightly constrained neo-classic poems ( although it 's important to note that the poet wrote first and foremost for his/her own creative , expression ) in the work of john clare the late augustan voice is blended with a peasant 's first-hand knowledge to produce arguably some of the finest nature poetry in the english language robert browning 's great innovation was the dramatic poetry , which he used to its full extent in his long novel in verse , the ring and the book elizabeth barrett browning is perhaps best remembered for sonnets from the portuguese but her long poem aurora leigh is one of the classics of 19th century feminist literature matthew arnold was much influenced by wordsworth , though his poem dover beach is often considered a precursor of the modernist revolution although primarily concerned with the visual arts , a member of the inner circle , dante gabriel rossetti was a poet of some ability , whilst his sister christina rossetti is generally considered a greater poet , whose contribution to victorian poetry is of a standard equal to that of elizabeth barrett browning morris shared the pre-raphaelite interest in the poetry of the european middle ages , to the point of producing some illuminated manuscript volumes of his work the victorian era continued into the early years of the 20th century and two figures emerged as the leading representative of the poetry of the old era to act as a bridge into the new yeats , although not a modernist , was to learn a lot from the new poetic movements that sprang up around him and adapted his writing to the new circumstances this collection was turned down by several publishers so that housman published it himself , and the work only became popular when '' the advent of war , first in the boer war and then in world war i , gave the book widespread appeal due to its nostalgic depiction of brave english soldiers '' poetry.org the poems ' wistful evocation of doomed youth in the english countryside , in spare language and distinctive imagery , appealed strongly to late victorian and edwardian taste , and the fact that several early 20th-century composers set it to music helped its popularity eliot , particularly after the publication of the waste land , became a major figure and influence on other english poets these included the london-welsh poet and painter david jones , whose first book , in parenthesis , was one of the very few experimental poems to come out of world war i , the scot hugh macdiarmid , mina loy and basil bunting a number of other , less enduring , poets also worked in the same vein these poets turned to french models rather than either the new country poets or english-language modernism , and their works were a proof of the importance of later english experimental poets as it broadened the scope of the english avant-garde tradition as with the poets of the first world war , the work of these writers can be seen as something of an interlude in the history of 20th century poetry the main movement in post-war 1940s poetry was the new romantic group that included dylan thomas , george barker , w thomas , in particular , helped anglo-welsh poetry to emerge as a recognisable force the movement poets as a group came to public notice in robert conquest 's 1955 anthology new lines a number of young poets working in what might be termed a modernist vein also started publishing during this decade the british poetry revival was a wide-reaching collection of groupings and subgroupings that embraces performance , sound and concrete poetry as well as the legacy of pound , jones , macdiarmid , loy and bunting , the objectivist poets , the beats and the black mountain poets , among others some consider the late geoffrey hill to have been the finest english poet of recent years the last three decades of the 20th century saw a number of short-lived poetic groupings , including the martians , along with a general trend towards what has been termed 'poeclectics ' , '' making voices : identity , poeclectics and the contemporary british poet '' , new writing , the international journal for the practice and theory of creative writing ; volume 3 ( 1 ) ; pp 66–77 mark ford is an example of a poet influenced by new york school throughout this period , and to the present , independent poetry presses such as enitharmon have continued to promote original work from ( among others ) dannie abse , martyn crucefix and jane duran
