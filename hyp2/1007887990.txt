the toaster was announced at the world of commodore expo in 1987 and released as a commercial product in december 1990 for the commodore amiga 2000 computer system , taking advantage of the video-friendly aspects of that system 's hardware to deliver the product at an unusually low cost of 2,399 the amiga was well adapted to this application in that its system clock at was precisely double that of the ntsc color carrier frequency , , allowing for simple synchronization of the video signal the hardware component is a full-sized card that is installed into the amiga 2000 's unique single video expansion slot rather than the standard bus slots , and therefore can not be used with the a500 or a1000 models this program became so popular in its own right that in 1994 it was made available as standalone product separate from the toaster systems the toaster hardware requires very stable input signals , and therefore is often used along with a separate video sync time-base corrector to stabilize the video sources as with all video switchers that use a frame buffer to create dves ( digital video effects ) , the video path through the toaster hardware introduced delays in the signals when the signal was in '' digital '' mode depending on the video setup of the user , this delay could be quite noticeable when viewed along with the corresponding audio , so some users installed audio delay circuits to match the toaster 's video-delay lag , as is common practice in video-switching studios a user still needs at least three video tape recorders ( vtr ) and a controller to perform b-roll linear video editing ( le ) , as the toaster serves merely as a switcher , which can be triggered through general-purpose input/output ( gpio ) to switch on cue in such a configuration , as the toaster has no edit-controlling capabilities the toaster was also the first such video device designed around a general-purpose personal computer that is capable of delivering broadcast-quality ntsc signals as such , during the early 1990s the toaster was widely used by consumer amiga owners , desktop video enthusiasts , and local television studios , and was even used during the tonight show regularly to produce special effects for comedy skits in addition to just processing live video signals , the flyer makes use of hard drives to store video clips as well as audio and allow complex scripted playback one of the card 's primary uses is for playing back lightwave 3d animations created in the toaster the tricaster packages the vt system as a turnkey solution in a custom-designed portable pc case with video , audio and remote computer inputs and outputs on the front and back of the case as of april 2008 , four versions are in production : the basic tricaster 2.0 , tricaster pro 2.0 , tricaster studio 2.0 and the new tricaster broadcast , the latter of which adds sdi and aes-ebu connectivity plus a preview output capability dollars worth of conventional 3d virtual set equipment alone , and is also found in newtek 's venerable vt5 integrated production suite , the modern-day successor to the original video toaster the xd300 also features five m/e style virtual inputs , permitting up to three video sources in one source , accessible like any other input on the switcher
