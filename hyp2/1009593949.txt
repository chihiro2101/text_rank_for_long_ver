a 2017 study found that the just war tradition can be traced as far back as to ancient egypt , '' demonstrating that just war thought developed beyond the boundaries of europe and existed many centuries earlier than the advent of christianity or even the emergence of greco-roman doctrine at the beginning of the war , there is the discussion of '' just conduct '' appropriate to the context of war in sikhism , the term dharamyudh describes a war that is fought for just , righteous or religious reasons , especially in defence of one 's own beliefs it was aristotle who first introduced the concept and terminology to the hellenic world where war was a last resort and required conduct that would not make impossible the restoration of peace christians and war : thomas aquinas refines the '' just war '' theory the just war theory , with some amendments , is still used by christians today as a guide to whether or not a war can be justified in the case of a country that has been invaded by an occupying force , war may be the only way to restore justice saint augustine held that , while individuals should not resort immediately to violence , god has given the sword to government for good reason ( based upon romans 13:4 ) in contra faustum manichaeum book 22 sections 69–76 , augustine argues that christians , as part of a government , need not be ashamed of protecting peace and punishing wickedness when forced to do so by a government defense of one 's self or others could be a necessity , especially when authorized by a legitimate authority : they who have waged war in obedience to the divine command , or in conformity with his laws , have represented in their persons the public justice or the wisdom of government , and in this capacity have put to death wicked men ; such persons have by no means violated the commandment , '' thou shalt not kill '' while not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just , augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase itself in his work the city of god : but , say they , the wise man will wage just wars mark mattox writes that , for the individual christian under the rule of a government engaged in an immoral war , augustine admonished that christians , '' by divine edict , have no choice but to subject themselves to their political masters and should seek to ensure that they execute their war-fighting duty as justly as possible according to aquinas , three requirements must be met : first , the war must be waged upon the command of a rightful sovereign second , the war needs to be waged for just cause , on account of some wrong the attacked have committed aquinas argued that it was only in the pursuit of justice , that the good intention of a moral act could justify negative consequences , including the killing of the innocent during a war the school 's adherents reasoned that war should be a last resort , and only then , when necessary to prevent an even greater evil examples of '' just war '' are : in self-defense , as long as there is a reasonable possibility of success war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation : it must comply with a series of additional requirements : it is necessary that the response be commensurate with the evil ; use of more violence than is strictly necessary would constitute an unjust war once war has begun , there remain moral limits to action in the early part of the first world war , a group of theologians in germany published a manifesto seeking to justify the actions of the german government the just war doctrine of the catholic church found in the 1992 catechism of the catholic church , in paragraph 2309 , lists four strict conditions for '' legitimate defense by military force '' : the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting , grave , and certain ; all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective ; there must be serious prospects of success ; the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated ( the power of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition ) the compendium of the social doctrine of the church elaborates on the just war doctrine in paragraphs 500 to 501 : : if this responsibility justifies the possession of sufficient means to exercise this right to defense , states still have the obligation to do everything possible '' to ensure that the conditions of peace exist , not only within their own territory but throughout the world '' nor does the mere fact that war has unfortunately broken out mean that all is fair between the warring parties '' the document offers criteria of distinguishing between an aggressive war , which is unacceptable , and a justified war , attributing the highest moral and sacred value of military acts of bravery to a true believer who participates in a “ justified ” war additionally , the document considers the just war criteria as developed in western christianity eligible for russian orthodoxy , so the “ justified war ” idea in western theology is applicable to the russian orthodox church too also , it is stated to orthodoxy has had profound respect for soldiers who gave their lives to protect the life and security of their neighbors if by pacifism is meant the teaching that the use of force is never justifiable , then , however well meant , it is mistaken , and it is hurtful to the life of our country just war theorists combine a moral abhorrence towards war with a readiness to accept that war may sometimes be necessary just war theories are attempts '' to distinguish between justifiable and unjustifiable uses of organized armed forces '' ; they attempt '' to conceive of how the use of arms might be restrained , made more humane , and ultimately directed towards the aim of establishing lasting peace and justice '' in more recent years , a third category—jus post bellum—has been added , which governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements , as well as the prosecution of war criminals in simple terms : '' to the russian workers has fallen the honor and the good fortune of being the first to start the revolution—the great and only legitimate and just war , the war of the oppressed against the oppressors in that manner , lenin shunned the more common interpretation of a defensive war as a just one—often summarized as '' who fired the first shot ? '' —precisely because it did n't take in consideration the class factor clearly , the application of the term '' defensive '' war , or war '' for the defense of the fatherland '' in such a case would be historically false , and in practice would be sheer deception of the common people , of philistines , of ignorant people , by the astute slaveowners the just war theory prevailing for most of the last two centuries—that violence is an evil that can , in certain situations , be condoned as the lesser of evils—is relatively young although it has inherited some elements ( the criteria of legitimate authority , just cause , right intention ) from the older war theory that first evolved around ad 400 , it has rejected two premises that underpinned all medieval just wars , including crusades : first , that violence could be employed on behalf of christ 's intentions for mankind and could even be directly authorized by him ; and second , that it was a morally neutral force that drew whatever ethical coloring it had from the intentions of the perpetrators just war theory has two sets of criteria , the first establishing jus ad bellum ( the right to go to war ) , and the second establishing jus in bello ( right conduct within war ) '' ; comparative justice : while there may be rights and wrongs on all sides of a conflict , to overcome the presumption against the use of force , the injustice suffered by one party must significantly outweigh that suffered by the other '' a just war must be initiated by a political authority within a political system that allows distinctions of justice a just war must be initiated by a political authority within a political system that allows distinctions of justice '' ; right intention : force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose—correcting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention , while material gain or maintaining economies is not in modern terms , just war is waged in terms of self-defense , or in defense of another ( with sufficient evidence ) this idea has largely been added to help decide what to do if there are prisoners that have been taken during battle this is the theory used to justify the actions taken by anyone fighting in a war to treat prisoners outside of war orend , who was one of the theorists mentioned earlier , proposes the following principles : ; just cause for termination : a state may terminate a war if there has been a reasonable vindication of the rights that were violated in the first place , and if the aggressor is willing to negotiate the terms of surrender alternatively , a state may end a war if it becomes clear that any just goals of the war can not be reached at all or can not be reached without using excessive force the victor state must also be willing to apply the same level of objectivity and investigation into any war crimes its armed forces may have committed truth and reconciliation may sometimes be more important than punishing war crimes draconian measures , absolutionist crusades , and any attempt at denying the surrendered country the right to participate in the world community are not permitted revolution and civil war – just war theory states that a just war must have just authority to the extent that this is interpreted as a legitimate government , this leaves little room for revolutionary war or civil war , in which an illegitimate entity may declare war for reasons that fit the remaining criteria of just war theory article 3 of the 1949 geneva conventions side-steps this issue by stating that if one of the parties to a civil war is a high contracting party ( in practice , the state recognized by the international community ) , both parties to the conflict are bound '' as a minimum , the following humanitarian provisions '' article 4 of the third geneva convention also makes clear that the treatment of prisoners of war is binding on both parties even when captured soldiers have an '' allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the detaining power '' military theory perpetual war philosophy of war use of force by states
