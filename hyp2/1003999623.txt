the national foundation for infantile paralysis , known today as the march of dimes , provided the initial funding construction began in 1962 and a handful of researchers moved into the first laboratory in 1963 additional buildings housing more laboratories as well as the organizational administrative offices were constructed in the 1990s , designed by anshen & allen many supporters , in particular the national foundation , '' helped him build his dream of a research complex for the investigation of biological phenomena 'from cell to society ' salk believed that the institution would help new and upcoming scientists along in their careers , as he said himself , '' i thought how nice it would be if a place like this existed and i was invited to work there '' father of biophilosophy '' the new york times , november 11 , 1966 author and journalist howard taubman explained : the new york times , in a 1980 article celebrating the 25th anniversary of the salk vaccine , described the current workings at the facility : at the institute , a magnificent complex of laboratories and study units set on a bluff overlooking the pacific , dr '' salk studies man 's future '' the new york times , april 8 , 1980 in an interview about his future hopes at the institute , he said , '' in the end , what may have more significance is my creation of the institute and what will come out of it , because of its example as a place for excellence , a creative environment for creative minds the salk institute , la jolla , california ( 1959â€“1965 ) was to be a campus composed of three clusters : meeting and conference areas , living quarters , and laboratories salk had sought a beautiful campus in order to draw the best researchers in the world jack macallister , faia , of the kahn firm was the supervising architect and a major design influence on the structure that consists of two symmetric buildings with a water stream flowing towards the ocean in the middle travertine-paved central plaza that separates the two the lighting fixtures on the roof slide along rails thus reflecting the collaborative and open philosophy of the salk institute 's science after two years of design work , and after the design had been approved and meetings with building contractors had begun , kahn and the salk institute abruptly decided to reduce the number of laboratory buildings from four narrow ones to two wider ones and to increase the number of floors per building from two to three komendant re-engineered the structure and produced a new set of drawings with a speed that professor leslie described as '' legendary '' in 1992 the american institute of architects ( aia ) gave this building its prestigious twenty-five year award , which is given to only one building per year at first kahn wanted to put a garden in the middle of the two buildings but , as construction continued , he did not know what shape it should take when he saw an exhibit of luis barragan 's work at the museum of modern art in new york , kahn invited baragan to collaborate on the court that separated the two buildings originally the design also included living quarters and a conference building , but they were never actually built the salk institute replete with empty space is symbolic of an open environment for creation the contrast between balance and dynamic space manifests a pluralistic invitation for scientific study in structures developed to accommodate their respective functions as parts of a research facility although modern in appearance , it is essentially an isolated compound for individual and collaborative study , not unlike monasteries as sanctuaries for religious discovery , and they are thought to have directly influenced kahn in his design left in keeping with his design and the philosophy of '' served and servant spaces , '' and as the vast requirement for mechanical spaces were extensive , kahn decided to create a separate service floor for them above each of the laboratories to make it easier to reconfigure individual laboratories in the future without disrupting neighboring spaces he also designed each laboratory floor to be entirely free of internal support columns , making laboratory configuration easier the institute is organized into several research units , each of which is further composed of several scientific groups , each led by a member of the faculty five of these are members of the howard hughes medical institute , and more than a quarter are elected members of the us national academy of sciences in terms of research output measured by number of publications and citations , the institute is recognized as one of the world 's leading institutions in several areas of biology , especially in neurosciences and plant biology broad
