the skeleton serves six major functions : support , movement , protection , production of blood cells , storage of minerals and endocrine regulation movement is powered by skeletal muscles , which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones muscles , bones , and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement , all coordinated by the nervous system it is believed that the reduction of human bone density in prehistoric times reduced the agility and dexterity of human movement shifting from hunting to agriculture has caused human bone density to reduce significantly the skeleton is the site of haematopoiesis , the development of blood cells that takes place in the bone marrow anatomical differences between human males and females are highly pronounced in some soft tissue areas , but tend to be limited in the skeleton muscle attachment sites on long bones are often more robust in males than in females , reflecting a difference in overall muscle mass and development between sexes one of the most common is osteoporosis also common is scoliosis , a side-to-side curve in the back or spine , often creating a pronounced '' c '' or '' s '' shape when viewed on an x-ray of the spine when affected by arthritis , the joint or joints affected may be painful to move , may move in unusual directions or may be immobile completely the most common form of arthritis , osteoarthritis , can affect both the larger and smaller joints of the human skeleton osteoporosis is defined by the world health organization in women as a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass , relative to the age and sex-matched average , as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , with the term '' established osteoporosis '' including the presence of a fragility fracture for this reason , dexa scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors , who have developed osteoporosis and be at risk of fracture it enumerates six types of dislocations , twelve varieties of fractures , and classification of the bone and their reaction to the injuries , and gives a classification of eye diseases including cataract
