however , suitability of this portion of the spectrum for such communication varies greatly with a complex combination of factors : sunlight/darkness at site of transmission and reception transmitter/receiver proximity to solar terminator season solar cycle sunspot aurora at any point in time , for a given '' skip '' communication path between two points , the frequencies at which communication is possible are specified by these parameters maximum usable frequency ( muf ) lowest usable high frequency ( luf ) and a frequency of optimum transmission ( fot ) the maximum usable frequency regularly drops below 10 & nbsp ; mhz in darkness during the winter months , while in summer during daylight it can easily surpass 30 & nbsp ; mhz when a transcontinental or worldwide path is open on a particular frequency , digital , ssb and morse code communication is possible using surprisingly low transmission powers , often of the order of milliwatts , provided suitable antennas are in use at both ends and that there is little or no man-made or natural interference the main users of the high frequency spectrum are : military and governmental communication systems aviation air-to-ground communications amateur radio shortwave international and regional broadcasting maritime sea-to-shore and ship-to-ship services over-the-horizon radar systems global maritime distress and safety system ( gmdss ) communication citizen 's band radio services worldwide ( generally 26-28 & nbsp ; mhz , the higher portion of the hf band , that behaves more like low-vhf ) the high frequency band is very popular with amateur radio operators , who can take advantage of direct , long-distance ( often inter-continental ) communications and the '' thrill factor '' resulting from making contacts in variable conditions international shortwave broadcasting utilizes this set of frequencies , as well as a seemingly declining number of '' utility '' users ( marine , aviation , military , and diplomatic interests ) , who have , in recent years , been swayed over to less volatile means of communication ( for example , via satellites ) , but may maintain hf stations after switch-over for back-up purposes however , the development of automatic link establishment technology based on mil-std-188-141 for automated connectivity and frequency selection , along with the high costs of satellite usage , have led to a renaissance in hf usage in government networks some modes of communication , such as continuous wave morse code transmissions ( especially by amateur radio operators ) and single sideband voice transmissions are more common in the hf range than on other frequencies , because of their bandwidth-conserving nature , but broadband modes , such as tv transmissions , are generally prohibited by hf 's relatively small chunk of electromagnetic spectrum space this is due to the frequencies on which bpl operates ( typically corresponding with the hf band ) and the tendency for the bpl signal to leak from power lines some bpl providers have installed notch filters to block out certain portions of the spectrum ( namely the amateur radio bands ) , but a great amount of controversy over the deployment of this access method remains alternatively , the same directional antennas used for transmitting are helpful for receiving , since most noise comes from all directions , but the desired signal comes from only one direction high frequency active auroral research program high frequency internet protocol radio propagation space weather critical frequency
