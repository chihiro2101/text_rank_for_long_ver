normally the transition from a spoken to an extinct language occurs when a language undergoes language death by being directly replaced by a different one the most prominent western example of such a language is latin , but comparable cases are found throughout world history due to the universal tendency to retain a historical stage of a language as liturgical language historical languages with living descendants that have undergone significant language change may be considered '' extinct '' , especially in cases where they did not leave a corpus of literature or liturgy that remained in widespread use ( see corpus language ) , as is the case with old english or old high german relative to their contemporary descendants , english and german some degree of misunderstanding can result from designating languages such as old english and old high german as extinct , or latin dead , while ignoring their evolution as a language this is expressed in the apparent paradox '' latin is a dead language , but latin never died in contrast , old english , old high german and latin never ceased evolving as living languages , nor did they become totally extinct as etruscan did similarly , old english and old high german never died , but developed into various forms of modern english and german with regard to the written language , skills in reading or writing etruscan are all but non-existent , but trained people can understand and write old english , old high german and latin this last observation illustrates that for latin , old english , or old high german to be described accurately as dead or extinct , the language in question must be conceptualized as frozen in time at a particular state of its history this is accomplished by periodizing english and german as old ; for latin , an apt clarifying adjective is classical , which also normally includes designation of high or formal register in their study of contact-induced language change , american linguists sarah grey thomason and terrence kaufman ( 1991 ) stated that in situations of cultural pressure ( where populations are forced to speak a dominant language ) , three linguistic outcomes may occur : first - and most commonly - a subordinate population may shift abruptly to the dominant language , leaving the native language to a sudden linguistic death the third and most rare outcome is for the pressured group to maintain as much of its native language as possible , while borrowing elements of the dominant language 's grammar ( replacing all , or portions of , the grammar of the original language ) language contact , creolization , and genetic linguistics , university of california press ( 1991 ) p dr anna goldsworthy on the barngarla language reclamation , the monthly , september 2014 hebrew is an example of a liturgical language that has successfully been revived for everyday use ) ( 1992 ) language death : factual and theoretical explorations with special reference to east africa ) ( 1977 ) 'language death ' ( international journal of the sociology of language vol sasse , hans-j√ºrgen ( 1992 ) 'theory of language death ' , in brenzinger ( ed
