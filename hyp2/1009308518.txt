free-living barnacles are attached to the substratum by cement glands that form the base of the first pair of antennae ; in effect , the animal is fixed upside down by means of its forehead the plates are held together by various means , depending on species , in some cases being solidly fused the eight pairs of thoracic limbs are referred to as '' cirre '' , which are feathery and very long , being used to filter food , such as plankton , from the water and move it towards the mouth the main sense of barnacles appears to be touch , with the hairs on the limbs being especially sensitive it is not a feeding stage ; its role is to find a suitable place to settle , since the adults are sessile it explores potential surfaces with modified antennules ; once it has found a potentially suitable spot , it attaches head-first using its antennules and a secreted glycoproteinous substance larvae assess surfaces based upon their surface texture , chemistry , relative wettability , color , and the presence or absence and composition of a surface biofilm ; swarming species are also more likely to attach near other barnacles typical acorn barnacles develop six hard calcareous plates to surround and protect their bodies for the rest of their lives , they are cemented to the substrate , using their feathery legs ( cirri ) to capture plankton once metamorphosis is over and they have reached their adult form , barnacles continue to grow by adding new material to their heavily calcified plates the sessile lifestyle of barnacles makes sexual reproduction difficult , as the organisms can not leave their shells to mate to facilitate genetic transfer between isolated individuals , barnacles have extraordinarily long penises⁠ barnacles probably have the largest penis to body size ratio of the animal kingdom , up to eight times their body length most barnacles are suspension feeders ; they dwell continually in their shells , which are usually constructed of six plates , and reach into the water column with modified legs within the intertidal zone , different species of barnacles live in very tightly constrained locations , allowing the exact height of an assemblage above or below sea level to be precisely determined in the swamping strategy , vast numbers of barnacles settle in the same place at once , covering a large patch of substrate , allowing at least some to survive in the balance of probabilities fast growth allows the suspension feeders to access higher levels of the water column than their competitors , and to be large enough to resist displacement ; species employing this response , such as the aptly named megabalanus , can reach in length ; other species may grow larger still ( austromegabalanus psittacus ) ( miocene ) showing internal plates in bioimmured smaller barnacles the anatomy of parasitic barnacles is generally simpler than that of their free-living relatives in part , their poor skeletal preservation is due to their restriction to high-energy environments , which tend to be erosional – therefore it is more common for their shells to be ground up by wave action than for them to reach a depositional setting the degree of disarticluation of fossils suggests the distance they have been transported , and since many species have narrow ranges of water depths , it can be assumed that the animals lived in shallow water and broke up as they were washed down-slope
