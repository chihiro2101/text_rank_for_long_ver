2009 there is no eclipse plumage , but the bare parts vary in color around the year on dry land , darters walk with a high-stepped gait , wings often spread for balance , just like pelicans do they tend to gather in flocks – sometimes up to about 100 birds – and frequently associate with storks , herons or ibises , but are highly territorial on the nest : despite being a colonial nester , breeding pairs – especially males – will stab at any other bird that ventures within reach of their long neck and bill they do not dive deep but make use of their low buoyancy made possible by wettable plumage , small air sacs and denser bones the long neck and pointed bill in combination with the '' darting '' mechanism make the birds dangerous even to larger carnivorous mammals , and they will actually move toward an intruder to attack rather than defending passively or fleeing the darters pair bond monogamously at least for a breeding season when one partner comes to relieve the other at the nest , males and females use the same display the male employs during courtship ; during changeovers , the birds may also '' yawn '' at each other breeding is seasonal ( peaking in march/april ) at the northern end of their range ; elsewhere they can be found breeding all year round typically , the male gathers nesting material and brings it to the female , which does most of the actual construction work the clutch size is two to six eggs ( usually about four ) which have a pale green color the last young to hatch will usually starve in years with little food available 2009 these birds reach sexual maturity by about two years , and generally live to around nine years the adults are also eaten occasionally , as they are rather meaty birds ( comparable to a domestic duck ) ; like other fish-eating birds such as cormorants or seaducks they do not taste particularly good though however , in its first documented use as an english term in 1818 , it referred to an old world darter ever since , it has also been used for the modern genus anhinga as a whole cormorants and darters are extremely similar as regards their body and leg skeletons and may be sister taxa in fact , several darter fossils were initially believed to be cormorants or shags ( see below ) however , as this agrees quite well with the fossil evidence e.g hence , the sulae and the frigatebirds – and some prehistoric relatives – are increasingly separated as the suliformes , which is sometimes dubbed '' phalacrocoraciformes '' there are four living species of darters recognized , all in the genus anhinga , although the old world ones were often lumped together as subspecies of a the late pleistocene anhinga laticeps is not specifically distinct from the australasian darter ; it might have been a large paleosubspecies of the last ice age the other families placed in the phalacrocoraciformes sequentially appear throughout the eocene , the most distinct – frigatebirds – being known since almost 50 ma ( million years ago ) and probably of paleocene origin 40 ma ) and fossil cormorants appearing soon thereafter , the origin of the darters as a distinct lineage was presumably around 50–40 ma , maybe a bit earlier becker ( 1986 ) , mayr ( 2009 ) : pp.67–70 fossil anhingidae are known since the early miocene ; a number of prehistoric darters similar to those still alive have been described , as well as some more distinct genera now extinct the diversity was highest in south america , and thus it is likely that the family originated there their distinctness has been doubted , but this was due to the supposed '' anhinga '' fraileyi being rather similar to macranhinga , rather than due to them resembling the living species : cione et al as evidenced by the fossil species ' biogeography centered around the equator , with the younger species ranging eastwards out of the americas , the hadley cell seems to have been the main driver of the genus ' success and survival : olson ( 1985 ) : p.206 anhinga walterbolesi worthy , 2012 ( late oligocene to early miocene of central australia anhinga subvolans ( brodkorb , 1956 ) ( early miocene of thomas farm , us ) – formerly in phalacrocorax uf 4500 , a proximal right humerus half ( 1998–99 ) , mlíkovský ( 2002 ) : p.74 '' anhinga '' fraileyi campbell , 1996 ( late miocene – ?
