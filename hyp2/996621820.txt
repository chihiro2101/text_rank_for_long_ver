first , common natural-language proof techniques can be used to prove that the example sentence is true in this method , in order to prove '' if a , then b '' , first a is assumed and then with that assumption b is shown to be true the example in the previous section used unformalized , natural-language reasoning in this context , it shows that if we assume there is a formal sentence ( x → y ) , where x itself is equivalent to ( x → y ) , then we can prove y with a formal proof one example of such a formal proof is as follows therefore , if y is an unprovable statement in a formal system , there is no statement x in that system such that x is equivalent to the implication ( x → y ) in specific cases where the classification of y is already known , few steps are needed to reveal the contradiction even if the underlying mathematical logic does not admit any self-referential sentences , certain forms of naive set theory are still vulnerable to curry 's paradox in set theories that allow unrestricted comprehension , we can nevertheless prove any logical statement y by examining the set can only represent +2 lambda calculus may be considered as part of mathematics if only lambda abstractions that represent a single solution to an equation are allowed there are many language constructs that implicitly invoke an equation that may have none or many solutions the variable represents the multiple values in a way that is meaningful in common human reasoning , but is also valid in mathematics the existence of the variable x was implicit in the natural language the argument in formal logic starts with assuming the validity of naming ( x → y ) as x the order of the quantifiers may be reversed using skolemization : however , now instantiation gives which is not the starting point for the proof and does not lead to a contradiction
