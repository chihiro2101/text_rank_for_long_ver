another oft-stated reason for opposition is the westphalian concept that foreign governments should never possess a right to intervene in another sovereign nation 's internal affairs ( including terrorism or any other non-international affair ) others did accept a limited right for military intervention in foreign countries , but nevertheless opposed the invasion on the basis that it was conducted without united nations ' approval and was hence a violation of international law claims that iraq 's secular government had any links to al-qaeda , the islamic fundamentalist terrorist group considered responsible for the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the world trade center and pentagon some expressed puzzlement that the united states would consider military action against iraq and not against north korea , which claimed it already had nuclear weapons and had announced that it was willing to contemplate war with the united states there was also criticism of coalition policy by those who did not believe that military actions would help to fight terror , with some believing that it would actually help al-qaeda 's recruitment efforts ; others believed that the war and immediate post-war period would lead to a greatly increased risk that weapons of mass destruction would fall into the wrong hands ( including al-qaeda ) these critics felt that the war would not help to reduce the threat of wmd proliferation , and that the real reason for the war was to secure control over the iraqi oil fields at a time when us links with saudi arabia were seen to be at risk administration officials denied these charges , and scholar jeff colgan writes that '' there is still no consensus on the degree to which oil played a role '' in the iraq war some opponents of the war also believed that there would be no weapons of mass destruction in iraq , and thus there was little reason for an invasion in 2006 for example he opined that when the history of iraq is written the period would '' look like just a comma '' , prompting criticism that he took the more than 2,700 us troop deaths lightly the iraq war has met with considerable popular opposition in the united states , beginning during the planning stages and continuing through the invasion subsequent occupation of iraq consistent with the anti-war sentiment of the protests , in the months leading up to the iraq war , american public opinion heavily favored a diplomatic solution over immediate military intervention a january 2003 cbs news/new york times poll found that 63 % of americans wanted president bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iraq situation , compared with 31 % who favored immediate military intervention that poll also found , however , that if diplomacy failed , support for military action to remove saddam hussein was above 60 percent days before the march 20 invasion , a usa today/cnn/gallup poll found support for the war was related to un approval security council were to reject a resolution paving the way for military action , only 54 % of americans favored a u.s and if the bush administration did not seek a final security council vote , support for a war dropped to 47 % immediately after the 2003 invasion most polls within the united states showed a substantial majority of americans supporting war , but that trend began to shift less than a year after the war began since the invasion of iraq , one of the most visible leaders of popular opposition in the u.s several prominent members of the military and national security communities , particularly those who

when representative john murtha , a vietnam combat veteran who voted to authorize the war and is widely regarded as an ardent supporter of the military , introduced a resolution calling for u.s on march 23 , 2007 , the house of representatives passed an iraq spending bill that requires that troops begin withdrawing in march 2008 and that most us forces be out of iraq by august 31 , 2008

mistake barack obama ( who went on to win the election ) was not a senator at the time of the voting of the iraq war resolution , but had repeatedly voiced his disapproval of it both before and during his senatorship , saying at an anti war rally in chicago on october 2 , 2002 : '' i am not opposed to all wars around the 2003 invasion of iraq and subsequent occupation of iraq , polling data
