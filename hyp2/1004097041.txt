early research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of reality , whether communities actually could exist through the media , which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology some authors that built their theories on anderson 's imagined communities have been critical of the concept , claiming that all communities are based on communication and that virtual/real dichotomy is disintegrating , making use of the word '' virtual '' problematic or even obsolete for example , an email distribution list could serve as a personal means of communicating with family and friends , and also formally to coordinate with coworkers the software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users ’ experience and designed specifically for online use user experience testing is utilized to reveal something about the personal experience of the human being using a product or system the widespread use of the internet and virtual communities by millions of diverse users for socializing is a phenomenon that raises new issues for researchers and developers the vast number and diversity of individuals participating in virtual communities worldwide makes it a challenge to test usability across platforms to ensure the best overall user experience some well-established measures applied to the usability framework for online communities are speed of learning , productivity , user satisfaction , how much people remember using the software , and how many errors they make the human computer interactions that are measured during a usability experience test focus on the individuals rather than their social interactions in the online community these forms of social networks allow for open conversation between individuals who are going through similar experiences , whether themselves or in their family such sites have so grown in popularity that now many health care providers form groups for their patients by providing web areas where one may direct questions to doctors people with rare or debilitating disorders may not be able to access support groups in their physical community , thus online communities act as primary means for such support online health communities can serve as supportive outlets as they facilitate connecting with others who truly understand the disease , as well as offer more practical support , such as receiving help in adjusting to life with the disease online health-focused communities were shown to offer a unique form of emotional support that differed from event-based realities and informational support networks growing amounts of presented material show how online communities affect the health of their users online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media , but also connect with large networked communities in his book the wealth of networks from 2006 , yochai benkler suggests that virtual communities would '' come to represent a new form of human communal existence , providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction '' although benkler 's prediction has not become entirely true , clearly communications and social relations are extremely complex within a virtual community previous concerns about the effects of internet use on community and family fell into two categories : 1 ) sustained , intimate human relations '' are critical to well-functioning human beings as a matter of psychological need '' and 2 ) people with '' social capital '' are better off than those who lack it however , benkler argues that unless internet connections actually displace direct , unmediated , human contact , there is no basis to think that using the internet will lead to a decline in those nourishing connections we need psychologically , or in the useful connections we make socially for these reasons , turkle argues users existing in online spaces are less compelled to judge or compare ourselves to our peers , allowing people in virtual settings an opportunity to gain a greater capacity for acknowledging diversity the gaming community is extremely vast and accessible to a wide variety of people , however , there are negative effects on the relationships 'gamers ' have with the medium when expressing identity of gender virtual communities may synthesize web 2.0 technologies with the community , and therefore have been described as community 2.0 , although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970s on timeshare systems like plato and later on usenet online communities depend upon social interaction and exchange between users online the lack of status that is presented with an online identity also might encourage people , because , if one chooses to keep it private , there is no associated label of gender , age , ethnicity or lifestyle shortly after the rise of interest in message boards and forums , people started to want a way of communicating with their '' communities '' in real time users can communicate as if they are speaking to one another in real life this '' simulated reality '' attribute makes it easy for users to form a virtual community , because chat rooms allow users to get to know one another as if they were meeting in real life the individual '' room '' feature also makes it more likely that the people within a chat room share a similar interest ; an interest that allows them to bond with one another and be willing to form a friendship this type of virtual community allows for people to not only hold conversations with others in real time , but also to engage and interact with others these business based worlds have stricter controls and allow functionality such as muting individual participants , desktop sharing , or access lists to provide a highly interactive and controlled virtual world to a specific business or group business based virtual worlds also may provide various enterprise features such as single sign on with third party providers , or content encryption with these sites , one often creates a profile or account , and adds friends or follow friends this allows people to connect and look for support using the social networking service as a gathering place all of these functions encourage people to form a community , large or small , on the internet in participatory culture , users feel that their contributions are important and that by contributing , they are forming meaningful connections with other users specialized information communities are a place where people with similar interests can discuss and share their experiences and interests indeed , in his revised version of virtual community , rheingold goes so far to say that had he read barry wellman 's work earlier , he would have called his book '' online social networks '' lipnack & stamps ( 1997 ) and mowshowitz ( 1997 ) point out how virtual communities can work across space , time and organizational boundaries ; lipnack & stamps ( 1997 ) mention a common purpose ; and lee , eom , jung and kim ( 2004 ) introduce '' desocialization '' which means that there is less frequent interaction with humans in traditional settings , e.g he believes that it also creates different personalities in people which can cause frictions in offline and online communities and groups and in personal contacts internet communities offer the advantage of instant information exchange that is not possible in a real-life community this interaction allows people to engage in many activities from their home , such as : shopping , paying bills , and searching for specific information users of online communities also have access to thousands of specific discussion groups where they can form specialized relationships and access information in such categories as : politics , technical assistance , social activities , health ( see above ) and recreational pleasures virtual communities provide an ideal medium for these types of relationships because information can easily be posted and response times can be very fast while instant communication means fast access , it also means that information is posted without being reviewed for correctness in theory , online identities can be kept anonymous which enables people to use the virtual community for fantasy role playing as in the case of second life 's use of avatars clan ( computer gaming ) commons-based peer production community of
