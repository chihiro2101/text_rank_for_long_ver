adomnán 's work was written in the very late 7th century , probably to mark the centenary of columba 's death the surviving irish annals contain elements of a chronicle kept at iona from the middle of the 7th century onwards , so that these too are retrospective when dealing with áedán 's time 89–90 francis john byrne suggested that the echtra was written by a poet at the court of diarmait mac maíl na mbó , an 11th-century descendant of brandub , and was written to cement an alliance between diarmait and the scots king malcolm iii of scotland ( '' malcolm iii '' ) , who claimed to be a descendant of áedán a lost irish tale , echtra áedáin mac gabráin ( the adventures of áedán son of gabrán ) , appears in a list of works , but its contents are unknown the echtra áedáin mac gabráin is listed in áedán is a character in the epic scéla cano meic gartnáin , but the events which inspired the tale appear to have taken place in the middle of the 7th century áedán additionally appears in a variety of welsh sources , making him one of the few non-britons to figure in welsh tradition though this triad , like the bonedd gwŷr y gogledd , flips father and son 's names as gauran map aedan , bromwich p the bonedd gwŷr y gogledd records him as a descendant of dyfnwal hen of alt clut , though the genealogy is much confused ( gauran is given as his son , rather than father ) according to the senchus , dál riata was divided into three sub-kingdoms in the 7th century , each ruled by a kin group named for their eponymous founder see , for example , byrne , irish kings , pp áedán 's brother eoganán is known from adomnán and his death is recorded c although nothing is known of cuildach and domangart or their descendants , adomnán mentions a certain ioan , son of conall , son of domnall , '' who belonged to the royal lineage of the cenél ngabráin '' , adomnán , ii , 22 áedán was about forty years old when he became king , following the death of his uncle conall mac comgaill in 574 adomnán claims that áedán was ordained as king by columba , the first example of an ordination known in britain and ireland adomnán , iii , 5 and translator 's note 358 ; broun ; byrne , irish kings , p charles-edwards , early christian ireland , p áedán is thought to be the king in question , and ulster sources say that báetán collected tribute from scotland 109–111 ; ó cróinín , early medieval ireland , pp following báetán 's death in 581 , the ulstermen abandoned the isle of man , which they had captured in báetán 's time , perhaps driven out by áedán who is recorded as fighting there c the prophecy of berchán says of áedán : '' thirteen years ( one after another ) he will fight against the pictish host ( fair the diadem ) a welsh triad names áedán 's plundering of alt clut as one of the '' three unrestrained plunderings of britain '' , and the poem peiryan vaban tells of a battle between áedán and rhydderch the lost irish epic orgain sratha cluada is usually thought to refer to the attack on alt clut in 870 by vikings , but macquarrie suggests that it may refer to an attack by áedán on rhydderch the battle was a decisive victory for æthelfrith , and bede says , carefully , that '' from that day until the present , no king of the irish in britain has dared to do battle with the english 103–104 , notes some textual inconsistencies in the irish sources , and suggests that the '' battle of the saxons '' recorded in the irish annals may not be bede 's '' battle of degsastan '' after the defeat of degsastan , the annals report nothing of áedán until his death around six years later , perhaps on 17 april 609 , the date supplied by the martyrology of tallaght , composed c the prophecy of berchán places his death in kintyre and says '' he will not be king at the time of his death '' , while the 12th century acta sancti lasriani claims that he was expelled from the kingship the name conaing implies a familiarity with anglo-saxons and their language as it is derived from old english cyning , king ; byrne , irish kings , pp.111–112 the appearance of two sons named eochaid is not an error , as noted by charles-edwards , p the main line of cenél ngabráin kings were the descendants of eochaid buide through his son domnall brecc , but the descendants of conaing successfully contested for the throne throughout the 7th century and into the 8th it has been suggested that gartnait son of áedán could be the same person as gartnait ii , king of the picts , whose death is reported around 601 , but this rests on the idea of pictish matriliny , which has been criticised the names of áedán 's wives are not recorded , but one was said to be brittonic , and another may have been a pictish woman named domelch , if indeed the gartnait son of domelch and gartnait son of áedán are one and the same artúr mac aedan of dalriada by michelle ziegler , the heroic age issue 1 , spring/summer 1999 scéla & nbsp ; – a catalogue of medieval irish narratives
