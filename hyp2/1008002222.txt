in roman mythology , saturn was an agricultural deity who was said to have reigned over the world in the golden age , when humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labour in a state of innocence while others indicate that the slaves feasted first , or that the masters actually served the food the participation of freeborn roman women is implied by sources that name gifts for women , but their presence at banquets may have depended on the custom of their time ; from the late republic onward , women mingled socially with men more freely than they had in earlier times seneca looked forward to the holiday , if somewhat tentatively , in a letter to a friend : '' it is now the month of december , when the greatest part of the city is in a bustle because gifts of value would mark social status contrary to the spirit of the season , these were often the pottery or wax figurines called sigillaria made specially for the day , candles , or '' gag gifts '' , of which augustus was particularly fond see also in a practice that might be compared to modern greeting cards , verses sometimes accompanied the gifts since this figure does not appear in accounts from the roman republic , the princeps of the saturnalia may have developed as a satiric response to the new era of rule by a princeps , the title assumed by the first emperor augustus to avoid the hated connotations of the word '' king '' ( rex ) art and literature under augustus celebrated his reign as a new golden age , but the saturnalia makes a mockery of a world in which law is determined by one man and the traditional social and political networks are reduced to the power of the emperor over his subjects it was felt , however , that the original day had thus been moved by two days , and so saturnalia was celebrated under augustus as a three-day official holiday encompassing both dates by the late republic , the private festivities of saturnalia had expanded to seven days , macrobius , saturnalia 1.10.3 , citing the atellane composers novius and mummius but during the imperial period contracted variously to three to five days 268 , note 3 ;

because jesus died during passover and , in the third century ad , passover was celebrated on 25 march , he may have assumed that jesus 's birthday must have come nine months later , on 25 december as a result of the close proximity of dates , many christians in western europe continued to celebrate traditional saturnalia customs in association with christmas and the surrounding holidays in medieval france and switzerland , a boy would be elected '' boy bishop '' on 28 december ( the feast of the holy innocents ) and would issue decrees much like the saturnalicius princeps this custom was common across western europe , but varied considerably by region ; in some places , the boy bishop 's orders could become quite rowdy and unrestrained , but , in others , his power was only ceremonial during the late middle ages and early renaissance , many towns in england elected a '' lord of misrule '' at christmas time to preside over the feast of fools this custom was sometimes associated with the twelfth night or epiphany a common tradition in western europe was to drop a bean-feast ; whoever found the object would become the '' king ( or queen ) of the bean '' the puritans banned the '' lord of misrule '' in england and the custom was largely forgotten shortly thereafter , though the bean in the pudding survived as a tradition of a small gift to the one finding a single almond hidden in the traditional christmas porridge in scandinavia nonetheless , in the middle of the nineteenth century , some of the old ceremonies , such as gift-giving , were revived in english-speaking countries as part of a widespread '' christmas revival '' during this revival , authors such as charles dickens sought to reform the '' conscience of christmas '' and turn the formerly riotous holiday into a family-friendly occasion vestiges of the saturnalia festivities may still be preserved in some of the traditions now associated with christmas
