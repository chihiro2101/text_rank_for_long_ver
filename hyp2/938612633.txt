the rhine campaign of 1795 ( april 1795 to january 1796 ) opened when two habsburg armies under the overall command of françois sébastien charles joseph de croix , count of clerfayt defeated an attempt by two republican french armies to cross the rhine river and capture the fortress of mainz pichegru 's army made a surprise capture of mannheim so that both french armies held significant footholds on the east bank of the rhine with jourdan temporarily out of the picture , the austrians defeated the left wing of the army of rhine and moselle at the battle of mainz and moved down the west bank in january 1796 , clerfayt concluded an armistice with the french , allowing the austrians to retain large portions of the west bank theodore ayrault dodge , warfare in the age of napoleon : the revolutionary wars against the first coalition in northern europe and the italian campaign , 1789–1797 the german-speaking states on the east bank of the rhine were part of the vast complex of territories in central europe called the holy roman empire german home towns : community , state , and general estate , 1648–1871 the armies of the first coalition included the contingents and the infantry and cavalry of the various states , amounted to about 125,000 troops ( including the three autonomous corps ) , a sizable force by eighteenth century standards but a moderate force by the standards of the revolutionary wars in total , charles ’ troops stretched in a line from switzerland to the north sea habsburg troops comprised the bulk of the army but the thin white line of habsburg infantry could not cover the territory from basel to frankfurt with sufficient depth to resist the pressure of the opposition compared to french coverage , charles had half the number of troops covering a 211-mile front , stretching from renchen , near basel to bingen furthermore , he had concentrated the bulk of his force , commanded by count baillet latour , between karlsruhe and darmstadt , where the confluence of the rhine and the main made an attack most likely , as it offered a gateway into eastern german states and ultimately to vienna , with good bridges crossing a relatively well-defined river bank in spring 1796 , drafts from the free imperial cities , and other imperial states in the swabian and franconian circles augmented the habsburg force with perhaps 20,000 men at the most as he gathered his army in march and april , it was largely guess work where they should be placed consequently , in may and early june , when the french started to mass troops by mainz and it looked as if the bulk of the french army would cross there—they even engaged the imperial force at altenkirchen ( 4 june ) and wetzler and uckerath ( 15 june ) —charles felt few qualms placing the 7000-man swabian militia at the crossing by kehl an assault into the german states was essential , as far as french commanders understood , not only in terms of war aims , but also in practical terms : the french directory believed that war should pay for itself , and did not budget for the feeding of its troops throughout that spring and early summer , the french army was in almost constant mutiny : in may 1796 , in the border town of zweibrücken , the 74th demi-brigade revolted the army of the french revolution : from citizen-soldiers to instrument of power , princeton university press , 1988 , pp the original austrian strategy was to capture trier and to use their position on the rhine 's west bank to strike at each of the french armies in turn however , after news arrived in vienna of napoleon bonaparte 's successes in northern italy , wurmser was sent to italy with 25,000 reinforcements ; the aulic council gave archduke charles command over both austrian armies and ordered him to hold his ground the right wing of the army of the rhine and moselle , under jean victor moreau 's command , was positioned east of the rhine from hüningen ( on the border with the french provinces , switzerland , and the german states ) northward , with its center along the queich river near landau and its left wing extended west toward saarbrücken the french plan called for its two armies to press against the flanks of the coalition 's northern armies in the german states while simultaneously a third army approached vienna through italy specifically , jean-baptiste jourdan 's army would push south from düsseldorf , hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves , which would allow moreau ’ s army an easier crossing of the rhine and huningen and kehl if all went according to plan , jourdan ’ s army could feint toward mannheim , which would force charles to reapportion his troops once charles moved the mass of his army to the north , moreau ’ s army , which early in the year had been stationed by speyer , would move swiftly south to strasbourg in the south , by basel , ferino ’ s column was to move speedily across the river and advanced up the rhine along the swiss and german shoreline , toward lake constance and spread into the southern end of the black forest military historians usually maintain that napoleon solidified the use of the autonomous corps , armies that could function without a great deal of direction , scatter about the countryside , but reform again quickly for battle ; this was actually a development that first emerged first in the french and indian war in the thirteen colonies and later in the american revolutionary war , and became widely used in the european military as the size of armies grew in the 1790s and during the napoleonic wars in addition , a small force of about 5,000 french royalists under the command of the louis joseph , prince of condé , supposedly covering the rhine from switzerland to freiburg im breisgau once charles committed his main army to the mid and northern rhine , however , moreau executed an about face , and a forced march with most his army and arrived at strasburg before charles realized the french had even left speyer on 20 june , his troops assaulted the forward posts between strasbourg and the river , overwhelming the pickets there ; the militia withdrew to kehl , leaving behind their cannons , which solved part of moreau 's artillery problem within a day , moreau had four divisions across the river , representing a fundamental success of the french plan , and they executed their plan with alacrity the habsburg and imperial armies did not have enough troops to hold off the army of the rhine and moselle and would need reinforcements from charles , who was occupied in the north keeping jourdan pinned down on the west bank of the rhine theodore ayrault dodge , warfare in the age of napoleon : the revolutionary wars against the first coalition in northern europe and the italian campaign , 1789–1797 , usa , leonaur , 2011 french troops destined to cross the rhine , 24 june 1796 german home towns : community , state , and general estate , 1648–1871 german armies : war and german politics 1648–1806
