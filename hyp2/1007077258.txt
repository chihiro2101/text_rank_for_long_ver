interferometry makes use of the principle of superposition to combine waves in a way that will cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern , which can be used to determine their relative phase difference it is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves the characteristics of the interference pattern depend on the nature of the light source and the precise orientation of the mirrors and beam splitter the central fringe representing equal path length may be light or dark depending on the number of phase inversions experienced by the two beams as they traverse the optical system the phase difference between the two beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector the resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured , or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded the heterodyne technique is used for ( 1 ) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as ( 2 ) amplifying a weak input signal ( assuming use of an active mixer ) while optical heterodyne interferometry is usually done at a single point it is also possible to perform this widefield after being perturbed by interaction with the sample under test , the sample beam is recombined with the reference beam to create an interference pattern which can then be interpreted if white light is used in young 's experiment , the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits , surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity lloyd 's mirror generates interference fringes by combining direct light from a source ( blue lines ) and light from the source 's reflected image ( red lines ) from a mirror held at grazing incidence the fizeau interferometer is shown as it might be set up to test an optical flat the reference flat is slightly beveled ( only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary ) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes by adjusting the tilt , which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern , one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes , so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines if it is decided to produce fringes in white light , then , since white light has a limited coherence length , on the order of micrometre , great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible the reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass in this orientation , the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections , resulting in the same number of phase inversions the result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference in a typical system , illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens in the absence of the paired flats , all light emitted from point a passing through the optical system would be focused at point a ' michelson and morley ( 1887 ) and other early experimentalists using interferometric techniques in an attempt to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether , used monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment , always switching to white light for the actual measurements the advantages of white light , which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern , far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low coherence length reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference because of the low coherence of the light source , interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample high resolution phase-contrast x-ray image of a spider phase contrast and differential interference contrast ( dic ) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine & nbsp ; 26 ) refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues there are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging , all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations
