the first flights of aerological instruments were done in the second half of the 19th century with kites and meteographs , a recording device measuring pressure and temperature that was recuperated after the experiment furthermore , the sounding was limited to low altitudes because of the link to the ground signal corps did the first primitive experiments with weather measurements from balloon , making use of the temperature dependence of radio circuits molchanov 's design became a popular standard because of its simplicity and because it converted sensor readings to morse code , making it easy to use without special equipment or training working with a modified molchanov sonde , sergey vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings at high altitude this became an important technique in the field , and vernov flew his radiosondes on land and sea over the next few years , measuring the radiation 's latitude dependence caused by the earth 's magnetic field in 1938 , diamond developed the first ground receiver for the radiosonde , which prompted the first service use of the nbs radiosondes in the navy then in 1939 , diamond and his colleagues developed a ground-based radiosonde called the “ remote weather station , ” which allowed them to automatically collect weather data in remote and inhospitable locations due to this and other improvements in cost ( about 25 ) , weight ( > 1 kilogram ) , and accuracy , hundreds of thousands of nbs-style radiosondes were produced nationwide for research purposes , and the apparatus was officially adopted by the u.s the expansion of economically important government weather forecasting services during the 1930s and their increasing need for data motivated many nations to begin regular radiosonde observation programs in 1985 , as part of the soviet union 's vega program , the two venus probes , vega 1 and vega 2 , each dropped a radiosonde into the atmosphere of venus although modern remote sensing by satellites , aircraft and ground sensors is an increasing source of atmospheric data , none of these systems can match the vertical resolution or less ) and altitude coverage of radiosonde observations , so they remain essential to modern meteorology modern radiosondes can use a variety of mechanisms for determining wind speed and direction , such as a radio direction finder or gps in the united states the national weather service is tasked with providing timely upper-air observations for use in weather forecasting , severe weather watches and warnings , and atmospheric research uses of upper air observations because a sonde may drift several hundred kilometers during the 90- to 120-minute flight , there may be concern that this could introduce problems into the model initialization
