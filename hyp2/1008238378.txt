the dry gelatin emulsion was not only more convenient , but it could also be made much more sensitive , greatly reducing exposure times one collodion process , the tintype , was in limited use for casual portraiture by some itinerant and amusement park photographers as late as the 1930s , and the wet plate collodion process was still in use in the printing industry in the 1960s for line and tone work ( mostly printed material involving black type against a white background ) since it was much cheaper than gelatin film in large volumes thumb the collodion process produced a negative image on a transparent support ( glass ) when a metal plate is coated with collodion , charged with silver nitrate , exposed , and developed , it produces a direct positive image , although 'backwards ' on the plate wet plate/collodion is also a relatively inexpensive process compared to its predecessor , and does not require polishing equipment or the extremely toxic fuming boxes needed for the daguerreotype with glass as the medium , the cost per image was also far less than special silver-plated copper plates , and more durable than paper negatives the process was also very fast for the time , requiring only a few seconds to expose an image in daylight , rather than 30 seconds or more for other forms of photography available in the mid-1800s the entire process , from coating to developing , had to be done before the plate dried 3 the wet plate process is used by a number of artists and experimenters who prefer its aesthetic qualities to those of the more modern gelatin silver process the extreme inconvenience of exposing wet collodion in the field led to many attempts to develop a dry collodion process , which could be exposed and developed some time after coating many methods worked to an extent ; they allowed the plate to be exposed hours , or even days , after coating an image could require anywhere from three to ten times more exposure on a dry plate than on a wet plate a light-sensitive plate could then be prepared by simply flowing this emulsion across the surface of a glass plate ; no silver nitrate bath was required these emulsions were slow , and could not be developed , so they were mostly used for positive printing the emulsions also had the advantage that they could be washed this salt could not be removed in the wet process however , with the emulsion process , it could be washed out after creation of the emulsion it was not as fast as the ordinary wet process , but was not nearly as slow as the dry plate processes : emulsions created in this manner could be used wet , but they were often coated on the plate and preserved in similar ways to the dry process : collodion emulsion plates were developed in an alkaline developer , not unlike those in common use today watch : george eastman house '' the collodion process â€“ photographic processes '' the getty museum : the wet collodion process step by step wet plate photography collodion : material safety data sheet compound w data sheet world wet plate day getting started in wetplate collodion photography old photography process : collodion wet plate
