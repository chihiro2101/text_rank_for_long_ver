'' front side '' refers to the external interface from the processor to the rest of the computer system , as opposed to the back side , where the back-side bus connects the cache ( and potentially other cpus ) other buses like the peripheral component interconnect ( pci ) , accelerated graphics port ( agp ) , and memory buses all connect to the chipset in order for data to flow between the connected devices these secondary system buses usually run at speeds derived from the front-side bus clock , but are not necessarily synchronized to it setting an fsb speed is related directly to the speed grade of memory a system must use increasing the front-side bus to 450 & nbsp ; mhz in most cases also means running the memory at 450 & nbsp ; mhz however , if the computations involving each element are more complex , the processor will spend longer performing these ; therefore , the fsb will be able to keep pace because the rate at which the memory is accessed is reduced overclocking is the practice of making computer components operate beyond their stock performance levels by manipulating the frequencies at which the component is set to run , and , when necessary , modifying the voltage sent to the component to allow it to operate at these higher frequencies more stably originally , this bus was a central connecting point for all system devices and the cpu the cpu may spend significant time idle while waiting to read or write data in main memory , and high-performance processors therefore require high bandwidth and low latency access to memory in a traditional architecture , the front-side bus served as the immediate data link between the cpu and all other devices in the system , including main memory many manufacturers publish the frequency of the front-side bus in mhz , but marketing materials often list the theoretical effective signaling rate ( which is commonly called megatransfers per second or mt/s ) for example , if a motherboard ( or processor ) has its bus set at 200 & nbsp ; mhz and performs 4 transfers per clock cycle , the fsb is rated at 800 mt/s
