along with these public space programs , many companies produce technical tools and components such as spacecraft and satellites these companies are also involved in other areas of aerospace , such as the construction of aircraft aerospace manufacturing is a high-technology industry that produces '' aircraft , guided missiles , space vehicles , aircraft engines , propulsion units , and related parts '' for each original equipment manufacturer ( oem ) , the us government has assigned a commercial and government entity code in the united states , the department of defense and the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) are the two largest consumers of aerospace technology and products others include the very large airline industry important locations of the civilian aerospace industry worldwide include washington state ( boeing ) , california ( boeing , lockheed martin , etc ( formerly finmeccnica ) account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort , with the european space agency as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products the historic soviet union was also the home of a major aerospace industry the united kingdom formerly attempted to maintain its own large aerospace industry , making its own airliners and warplanes , but it has largely turned its lot over to cooperative efforts with continental companies , and it has turned into a large import customer , too , from countries such as the united states however , the uk has a very active aerospace sector , including the second largest defence contractor in the world , bae systems , supplying fully assembled aircraft , aircraft components , sub-assemblies and sub-systems to other manufacturers , both in europe and all over the world however canada still manufactures some military aircraft although they are generally not combat capable china has developed an extensive capability to design , test and produce military aircraft , missiles and space vehicles despite the cancellation in 1983 of the experimental shanghai y-10 , china is still developing its civil aerospace industry the aircraft parts industry was born out of the sale of second-hand or used aircraft parts from the aerospace manufacture sector once a part is overhauled its value is determined from the supply and demand of the aerospace market when an airline has an aircraft on ground , the part that the airline requires to get the plane back into service becomes invaluable at the end of world war i , piston engine power could be boosted by compressing intake air with a compressor , also compensating for decreasing air density with altitude , improved with 1930s turbochargers for the boeing b-17 the 1937 hindenburg disaster ended the era of passenger airships but the us navy used airships for anti-submarine warfare and airborne early warning into the 1960s , while small airships continue to be used for aerial advertising , sightseeing flights , surveillance and research , and the airlander 10 or the lockheed martin lmh-1 continue to be developed in 1954 , bell labs developed the first transistorized airborne digital computer , tradic for the us boeing b-52 and in the 1960s raytheon built the mit-developed apollo guidance computer ; the mil-std-1553 avionics digital bus was defined in 1973 then first used in the general dynamics f-16 , while the civil arinc 429 was first used in the boeing 757/b767 and airbus a310 in the early 1980s ziegler , was brought to the us under operation paperclip along wernher von braun and vanguard 1 was its first application in 1958 , later enhanced in space-deployable structures like the international space station solar arrays of functional safety relates to a part of the general safety of a system or a piece of equipment
