rimbaud wrote to several famous poets but received either no reply or a disappointing mere acknowledgement ( as from theodore de banville ) ; so his friend , office employee charles auguste bretagne , advised him to write to paul verlaine , a rising poet who had published two well regarded collections ( and future leader of the symbolist movement ) rimbaud sent verlaine two letters with several of his poems , including the hypnotic , finally shocking '' le dormeur du val '' ( the sleeper in the valley ) , in which nature is called upon to comfort an apparently sleeping soldier in later published recollections of his first sight of rimbaud at the age of sixteen , verlaine described him as having '' the real head of a child , chubby and fresh , on a big , bony , rather clumsy body of a still-growing adolescent '' , with a '' very strong ardennes accent that was almost a dialect '' their stormy relationship eventually brought them to london in september 1872 , a period over which rimbaud would later express regret the relationship between the two poets grew increasingly bitter , and verlaine abandoned rimbaud in london to meet his wife in brussels rimbaud was not well liked at the time , and many people thought of him as dirty and rude mérat also spread many rumours in the salons that verlaine and rimbaud were sleeping together ; the spread of those rumours was the commencement of fall for the two poets , who were trying to build a good reputation for themselves in late june 1873 , verlaine returned to paris alone , but quickly began to mourn rimbaud 's absence rimbaud returned home to charleville and completed his prose work une saison en enfer ( '' a season in hell '' ) —still widely regarded as a pioneering example of modern symbolist writing they lived together for three months while he put together his groundbreaking illuminations , a collection of prose poems , although he eventually did not see it through publication ( it only got published in 1886 , without the author 's knowledge ) rimbaud and verlaine met for the last time in march 1875 , in stuttgart , after verlaine 's release from prison and his conversion to catholicism by then rimbaud had given up literature in favour of a steady , working life stéphane mallarmé , in a text about rimbaud from 1896 ( after his death ) , described him as a '' meteor , lit by no other reason than his presence , arising alone then vanishing '' who had managed to '' surgically remove poetry from himself while still alive '' albert camus , in l'homme révolté , although he praised rimbaud 's literary works ( particularly his later prose works , une saison en enfer and illuminations — '' he is the poet of revolt , and the greatest '' ) , wrote a scathing account of his resignation from literature — and revolt itself — in his later life , claiming that there is nothing to admire , nothing noble or even genuinely adventurous , in a man who committed a '' spiritual suicide '' , became a '' bourgeois traficker '' and consented to the materialistic order of things in the following years , between 1888 and 1890 , rimbaud established his own store in harar , but soon got bored and dismayed on the 100th anniversary of rimbaud 's birth , thomas bernhard delivered a memorial lecture on rimbaud and described his end : '' on november 10 , at two o'clock in the afternoon , he was dead , '' noted his sister isabelle the first known poems of arthur rimbaud were mostly emulating the style of the parnasse school and other famous contemporary poets like victor hugo , although he quickly developed an original approach , both thematically and stylistically ( in particular by mixing profane words and ideas with sophisticated verse , as in '' vénus anadyomène '' , '' oraison du soir '' or '' les chercheuses de poux '' ) this inspiration would help him create a style of poetry later labeled as symbolist in may 1871 , aged 16 , rimbaud wrote two letters explaining his poetic philosophy , commonly called the lettres du voyant ( '' letters of the seer '' ) in the first , written 13 may to izambard , rimbaud explained : i 'm now making myself as scummy as i can it involves enormous suffering , but one must be strong and be a born poet the second letter , written 15 may—before his first trip to paris—to his friend paul demeny , expounded his revolutionary theories about poetry and life , while also denouncing some of the most famous poets that preceded him ( reserving a particularly harsh criticism for alfred de musset , while holding charles baudelaire in high regard , although , according to rimbaud , his vision was hampered by a too conventional style ) rimbaud died without the benefit of knowing that his manuscripts had not only been published but were lauded and studied , having finally gained the recognition for which he had striven , peyre , henri , foreword , a season in hell and illuminations by arthur rimbaud , translated by enid rhodes , new york : oxford , 1973 , p his friend ernest delahaye , in a letter to paul verlaine around 1875 , claimed that he had completely forgotten about his past self writing poetry french poet and scholar gérard macé wrote : '' rimbaud is , first and foremost , this silence that ca n't be forgotten , and which , for anyone attempting to write themselves , is there , haunting by mason , i promise to be good : the letters of arthur rimbaud ( new york : modern library , 2004 ) the letters written in africa were first published by paterne berrichon , the poet 's brother-in-law , who took the liberty of
