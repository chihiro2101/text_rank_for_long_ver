century of inventions one was for a steam-powered pump to supply water to fountains ; the device alternately used a partial vacuum and steam pressure two containers were alternately filled with steam , then sprayed with cold water making the steam within condense ; this produced a partial vacuum that would draw water through a pipe up from a well to the container a fresh charge of steam under pressure then drove the water from the container up another pipe to a higher-level header before that steam condensed and the cycle repeated savery 's invention can not be strictly regarded as the first steam '' engine '' since it had no moving parts and could not transmit its power to any external device a theoretical problem with savery 's device stemmed from the fact that a vacuum could only raise water to a maximum height of about ; to this could be added another , or so , raised by steam pressure in savery 's pamphlet , he suggests setting the boiler and containers on a ledge in the mineshaft and even a series of two or more pumps for deeper levels obviously these were inconvenient solutions and some sort of mechanical pump working at surface level – one that lifted the water directly instead of '' sucking '' it up – was desirable papin describes first pouring a small quantity of water into the bottom of a vertical cylinder , inserting a piston on a rod and after first evacuating the air below the piston , placing a fire beneath the cylinder to boil the water away and create enough steam pressure to raise the piston to the top end of the cylinder the fire was then removed , allowing the cylinder to cool , which condensed steam back into water , thus creating a vacuum beneath the piston the boiler supplied the steam at extremely low pressure and was at first located immediately beneath the power cylinder but could also be placed behind a separating wall with a connecting steam pipe this produced large quantities of very low pressure steam , no more than 1 – 2 psi ( 0.07 – 0.14 bar ) – the maximum allowable pressure for a boiler that in earlier versions was made of copper with a domed top of lead and later entirely assembled from small riveted iron plates the action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking beam engine , the lever e of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side projecting outside of the building , the engine being located in-house from the in-house arch-head d was suspended a piston p working in a cylinder b , the top end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston and the bottom end closed , apart from the short admission pipe connecting the cylinder to the boiler ; early cylinders were made of cast brass , but cast iron was soon found more effective and much cheaper to produce the header tank supplied cold water under pressure via a stand-pipe for condensing the steam in the cylinder with a small branch supplying the cylinder-sealing water ; at each top stroke of the piston excess warm sealing water overflowed down two pipes , one to the in-house well and the other to feed the boiler by gravity the pump equipment was heavier than the steam piston , so that the position of the beam at rest was pump-side down/engine-side up , which was called '' out of the house '' as the low pressure steam from the boiler flowed into the cylinder , the weight of the pump and gear returned the beam to its initial position whilst at the same time driving the water up from the mine newcomen found that his first engine would stop working after a while , and eventually discovered that this was due to small amounts of air being admitted to the cylinder with the steam on the 1712 engine , the water feed pump was attached to the bottom of the plug tree , but later engines had the pump outside suspended from a separate small arch-head there is a common legend that in 1713 a cock boy named humphrey potter , dionysius lardner , the steam engine familiarly explained and illustrated whose duty it was to open and shut the valves of an engine he attended , made the engine self-acting by causing the beam itself to open and close the valves by suitable cords and catches ( known as the '' potter cord '' ) ; however the plug tree device ( the first form of valve gear ) was very likely established practice before 1715 , and is clearly depicted in the earliest known images of newcomen engines by henry beighton ( 1717 ) ( believed by hulse to depict the 1714 griff colliery engine ) and by thomas barney ( 1719 ) ( depicting the 1712 dudley castle engine ) because of the very heavy steam demands , the engine had to be periodically stopped and restarted , but even this process was automated by means of a buoy rising and falling in a vertical stand pipe fixed to the boiler ( the first pressure gauge ? ) current opinion is that at least on the early engines , dead-weight force pumps were used , the work of the engine being solely to lift the pump side ready for the next downwards pump stroke towards the close of its career , the atmospheric engine was much improved in its mechanical details and its proportions by john smeaton , who built many large engines of this type during the 1770s although the principle of the crank had long been known , pickard managed to obtain a 12-year patent in 1780 for the specific application of the crank to steam engines ; this was a setback to boulton and watt who got round the patent by applying the sun and planet motion to their advanced double-acting rotative engine of 1782 use of the newcomen engine was extended in some places to pump municipal water supply ; for instance the first newcomen engine in france was built at passy in 1726 to pump water from the seine to the city of paris it was also used to power machinery indirectly , by returning water from below a water wheel to a reservoir above it , so that the same water could again turn the wheel this meant that a considerable amount of fuel was being used just to heat the cylinder back to the point where the steam would start to fill it again it also enabled the development of a double-acting cylinder , with both upwards and downwards power strokes , increasing amount of power from the engine without a great increase in the size of the engine black country living museum : newcomen steam engine the 'fire engine ' as it was known , is an impressive brick building from which a wooden beam projects through one wall
