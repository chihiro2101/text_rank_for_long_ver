little is known about the first inhabitants to cross over to the islands , but they likely came across in search of a safe haven from attack '' eight incredible things you did n't know about ireland 's aran islands '' , irish post , june 29 , 2017 in the 1820s , harvesting kelp was an important sideline to raise money for the land rents '' leaving the “ dreadful rocks ” , history ireland , vol.7 , issue 2 ( summer 1999 ) in 1898 , john millington synge started spending his summers in the aran islands '' the ‘ new york times ’ came to the aran islands here ’ s what it found '' , the irish times , september 13 , 2018 the result is that the aran islands are one of the finest examples of a glacio-karst landscape in the world any karstification now seen dates from around 11,000 years ago , so the island karst is recent since grass will grow once the temperature rises above , this means that the island ( like the neighbouring burren ) has one of the longest growing seasons in ireland or britain , and supports diverse and rich plant growth the islands were first populated in larger numbers probably at the time of the cromwellian conquest of ireland in the mid-17th century , when the catholic population of ireland had the choice of going '' to hell or to connacht '' many fled to the numerous islands off the west coast of ireland , where they adapted themselves to the raw climatic conditions , developing a survival system of total self-sufficiency an unusually high rate of irish-language monolingualism was found among senior natives until the end of the 20th century , in large part because of the isolating nature of the traditional trades practised and the natural isolation of the islands in general from mainland ireland over the course of the islands ' history many blame the decline of irish-speaking among young members of the island community on english-language television , available since the 1960s ; furthermore , many younger islanders leave for the mainland when they come of age visitors come in large numbers , particularly in the summer since 2000 , áras éanna arts centre , inisheer , has been welcoming artists in residence , both local and international , to stay and work on the inspirational aran islands for periods of one month the unusual cultural and physical history of the islands has made them the object of visits by a variety of writers and travelers who recorded their experiences beginning around the late 19th century , many irish writers traveled to the aran islands ; lady gregory , for example , came to aran in the late 19th century to learn irish at the start of the 20th century and throughout his life , one of ireland 's leading artists , seán keating , spent time every year on the islands translating onto canvas all the qualities that make the inhabitants of these atlantic islands so unusual and in many respects remarkable many wrote of their experiences in a personal vein , alternately casting them as narratives about finding , or failing to find , some essential aspect of irish culture that had been lost to the more urban regions of ireland a second , related kind of visitor was those who attempted to collect and catalogue the stories and folklore of the island , treating it as a kind of societal '' time capsule '' of an earlier stage of irish culture one might consider john millington synge 's the aran islands as a work that straddles these first two modes , it being both a personal account and also an attempt at preserving information about the pre- ( or il- ) literate aran culture in literary form in the second half of the 20th century , until perhaps the early 1970s , a third kind of visitor came to the islands they came not necessarily because of the uniquely '' irish '' nature of the island community , but simply because the accidents of geography and history conspired to produce a society that some found intriguing or even beguiling , and they wished to participate in it directly at no time was there a single '' aran '' culture ; any description is necessarily incomplete and can be said to apply completely only to '' parts '' of the island at certain points in time visitors who came and stayed , though , were mainly attracted to aspects of aran culture such as : it was isolated from mainstream print and electronic media , thus reliant primarily on local oral tradition for both entertainment and news instead , they looked directly towards ways in which their time on the islands put them in touch with more general truths about life and human relations , and they often took pains to live '' as an islander '' , eschewing help from friends and family at home this third mode of being in aran died out in the late 1970s due in part to the increased tourist traffic and in part to technological improvements made to the island , that relegated the above aspects to history a fourth kind of visitor to the islands , still prominent today , comes for spiritual reasons often connected to an appreciation for celtic christianity or more modern new age beliefs , the former of which finds sites and landscapes of importance on the islands finally , many thousands of visitors come for broadly tourism , to see the ruins , hear irish spoken ( and irish music played ) in the few pubs on the island , and to experience the often awe-inspiring geology of cliffs tourists and visitors of the fourth kind , however , are under-represented as creators of literature or art directly connected to the island ; few are ordinary '' travelogues '' of note , perhaps because of the small size of the islands , and no personal accounts are written about aran that are primarily concerned with spirituality robinson also has written , and continues to write , about the connemara region that faces the aran islands on the galway mainland more modern versions are still built for racing at the many local regattas , or cruinnithe up and down the west coast of ireland during the summer the aran islands are mentioned in james joyce 's short story '' the dead '' ( 1914 ) as a place where native irish is spoken '' the writer , however , is on record as having said that he simply made this up ; it does not actually refer to anything connected with the aran islands
