therefore the addressable memory is limited to the physical memory of the network device on which the operating system is installed the disadvantage of the ios architecture is that it increases the complexity of the operating system , data corruption is possible as one process can write over the data of another , and one process can destabilize the entire operating system or even cause a software-forced crash an interface descriptor block , or simply idb , is a portion of memory or cisco ios internal data structure that contains information such as the ip address , interface state , and packet statistics for networking data the number of idbs present in a system varies with the cisco hardware platform type ios is shipped as a unique file that has been compiled for specific cisco network devices each ios image therefore include a feature set , which determine the command-line interface ( cli ) commands and features that are available on different cisco devices upgrading to another feature set therefore entails the installation of a new ios image on the networking device and reloading the ios operating system information about the ios version and feature-set running on a cisco device can be obtained with the show version command for example , cisco ios releases meant for use on catalyst switches are available as '' standard '' versions ( providing only basic ip routing ) , '' enhanced '' versions , which provide full ipv4 routing support , and '' advanced ip services '' versions , which provide the enhanced features as well as ipv6 support to simplify the process of enlarging the feature-set and reduce the need for network operating system reloads , cisco introduced universal ios images , that include all features available for a device and customers may unlock certain features by purchasing an additional software license the exact feature set required for a particular function can be determined using the cisco feature set browser routers come with ip base installed , and additional feature pack licenses can be installed as bolt-on additions to expand the feature set of the device to patch a vulnerability in an ios , a binary file with the entire operating system needs to be loaded '' train '' is cisco-speak for '' a vehicle for delivering cisco software to a specific set of platforms and features e ( zero , one or two letters ) is the software release train identifier , such as none ( which designates the mainline , see below ) , t ( for technology ) , e ( for enterprise ) , s ( for service provider ) , xa as a special functionality train , xb as a different special functionality train , etc cisco says , '' a train is a vehicle for delivering cisco software to a specific set of platforms and features ) cisco does n't recommend usage of t train in production environments unless there is urgency to implement a certain t train 's new ios feature there were other trains from time to time , designed for specific needs — for example , the 12.0aa train contained new code required for cisco 's as5800 product this is designed to prevent '' shoulder-surfing '' attacks when viewing router configurations and is not secure – they are easily decrypted using software called '' getpass '' available since 1995 , or '' ios7crypt '' , ios7crypt a modern variant , although the passwords can be decoded by the router using the '' key chain '' command and entering the type 7 password as the key , and then issuing a '' show key '' command ; the above example decrypts to '' stupidpass '' in addition , competitive router operating systems that emerged 10–20 years after ios , such as juniper 's junos , were designed not to have these limitations the ios xr development train used the real-time operating system microkernel ( qnx ) , so a large part of the ios source code was re-written to take advantage of the features offered by the kernel
