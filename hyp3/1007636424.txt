the standard first degree for students studying arts or humanities in scotland is either a bachelor of arts or a master of arts ( the latter traditionally awarded by the ancient universities of scotland for a first degree in an arts/humanities subject ) students can work towards a first degree at either ordinary or honours level the ordinary degree need not be in a specific subject , but can involve study across a range of subjects within ( and sometimes beyond ) the relevant faculty , in which case it may also be called a general degree ; if a third year or junior honours subject is included , the ordinary degree in that named discipline is awarded the honours degree involves two years of study at a sub-honours level in which a range of subjects within the relevant faculty are studied and then two years of study at honours level which is specialised in a single field ( for example classics , history , chemistry , biology , etc not all universities in scotland adhere to this , in some you study in several subjects within a faculty for three years and can then specialise in two areas and attain a joint honours degree in fourth year bachelor 's degrees are normally three to four years in duration , more commonly three years in quebec ( where they follow on from college courses rather than directly from secondary education ) these programs are particularly interesting because they allow students to enter professional university programs , such as physiotherapy ( which consists of an integrated bachelor of science in physiotherapy and master of physical therapy ) , without having to meet the usual grade and course prerequisites required from students holding a pre-university science diploma a similar option is offered for college nursing graduates as they can pursue their studies in university to obtain a bachelor of nursing in two years ( rather than the usual three or four years , depending on whether the student has completed a college diploma in quebec ) additionally , whereas aspiring medical students are usually required to complete an undergraduate degree before applying to medical schools , quebec college graduates have the option to enter : a '' medical preparatory '' year at mcgill university or université de montréal and then pursue medical studies for the four following years ; directly into the undergraduate medical education program at université laval ( 4 to 5 years in duration ) or université de sherbrooke ( 4 years in duration ) once in university , students begin the carrera , the study of a precise academic branch like economics , business administration , sciences , law , engineering or medicine upon graduation , students receive a licenciatura in their chosen subject area , which is equivalent to an american bachelor 's degree several mexican universities offer students the possibility of obtaining an equivalent to an associate degree , called in mexico técnico superior universitario ( tsu ) , studying only half of the licenciatura , with the possibility of finishing a full bachelor 's degree later after receiving the licenciatura , students may take extra courses called diplomados ( similar to a certification but issued by a university ) these courses last 4–12 months and are a means to further study without continuing to the next degree level , usually studied to demonstrate that the student still updated in his field traditionally , students who have completed the maestria may continue on to the doctorado or the doctorate most standard academic programs are based on the four-year bachelor 's degree , most often bachelor of arts ( b.a ) ; either of these programs might be as long as three years in length ) and a further two to five years of coursework and research , culminating in '' comprehensive '' examinations in one or more fields , plus perhaps some teaching experience and then the writing of a dissertation for the doctorate , for a total of ten or more years from starting the bachelor 's degree ( which is usually begun around age 18 ) to the awarding of the doctorate the '' first professional degree '' is a graduate level degree program designed to prepare graduates for professional practice in various fields other than academic scholarship and research most professional degree programs require a prior bachelor 's degree for admission and many require seven or eight years of total study , which are classified as master 's degrees , or with intermediate graduate qualifications that also bear the title of doctor , such as d.min they include awards such as advanced certificates , advanced graduate certificates , graduate diplomas , professional engineer status and professional diplomas , as well as specialist degrees such as education specialist , doctor of ministry , doctor of psychology and the licentiate in sacred theology these are the associate degree ( level 6 ) , which normally takes 2 years , the bachelor degree ( level 7 ) , which normally takes 3 years , the honours degree ( level 8 ) , which normally takes 1 year after the bachelor 's degree and is mostly taken as an optional extension year depending of the discipline , the master degree ( level 9 ) , which normally takes 1 – 2 years for '' research '' or '' coursework '' degrees and 3 – 4 years for an '' extended '' degree and follows on from either a bachelor or honours degree and the doctorate ( level 10 ) , which normally takes 3 – 4 years following on from a master 's degree or a class i or iia honours qualification also included within the higher education system are graduate certificates and graduate diplomas , both of which are at level 8 ( honours degree level ) , as well as advanced diplomas , at level 6 ( associate degree level ) and diplomas at level 5 ( first year of a degree course ) professional doctorates still require research leading to '' a significant and original contribution to knowledge in the context of professional practice '' and should not be confused with extended master 's degrees that bear similar names for historical reasons : the juris doctor and doctors of medical practice , physiotherapy , dentistry and optometry despite their names , these extended master 's degrees may not be described as doctoral degrees nor do they confer the right to use the title of doctor on their recipients licentiate degree , normally takes four-years length degrees , available for students who want to qualify as school teachers individuals who hold either a bachelor 's degree , licentiate or technologist are eligible for admission into graduate courses leading to advanced master 's or doctor 's degrees there are two types of post-graduate programs , lato sensu ( specialization and mbas ) and stricto sensu ( professional master 's , master 's and doctorate ) : specializations or mbas are courses that include taking a minimum number ( minimum 360 hours ) of graduate classes but with no need to do research nor defend a thesis , only present a final work showing the knowledge requirements for an academic master 's degree include taking a minimum number of advanced graduate classes ( typically between five and eight ) and submitting a research thesis which is examined orally by a panel of at least two examiners ( three is the preferred number ) , sometimes including one external member who must be from another university or research institute requirements for obtaining a doctor 's degree include taking additional advanced courses , passing an oral qualifying exam and submitting a longer doctoral dissertation which must represent a significant original contribution to knowledge in the field to which the dissertation topic is related finally , a small number of brazilian universities , most notably the public universities in the state of são paulo still award the title of livre-docente ( free docent ) , which is of higher standing than a doctorate and is obtained , similar to the german habilitation , by the submission of a second ( original or cumulative ) thesis and approval in a livre-docência examination that includes giving a public lecture before a panel of full professors the first one is called a '' '' ( professional career ) , which is similar to a bachelor 's degree requiring from four to 6 years of study according to the chosen program the other option is called a '' técnico '' ( technician ) ; this degree consists in two and a half years of study and prepares the student for technical or mechanical labors finally , the third option is called a ¨tecnólogo¨ ( equivalent to associate degree ) and consist of 3 years of study students also can take a specialization course , '' '' , equivalent to a graduate certificate degree , after their bachelor 's degree in chile , there 's a distinction between academic degrees and professional titles : is the denomination given to an academic degree granted by a higher education institution recognized by the chilean mineduc ( ministry of education ) among degrees , we can find the following levels : , undergraduate degree obtained by completing a 2-year '' bachillerato '' higher education programs that provide a professional title but not an academic degree are referred to as '' '' , which are similar in duration and scope to associate degree programs the reason for this diversity is because some schools provide vocational education as part of their high school curriculum ( thereby allowing them to hand out '' technician '' titles ) while elsewhere , the student is required to decide whether to study sciences or humanities for the last two years of secondary school some higher education institutions may award diplomados ( diploma ) , but the time necessary to obtain one varies postgraduate education follows conventions of the united states ( being named '' master 's '' and '' doctorate '' after the programs there ) '' there are three cycles of degrees that constitute the core of degrees granted by pontifical universities : the first cycle leading to the baccalaureate degree ; the second cycle leading to the licentiate degree ; the third cycle leading to the doctorate
