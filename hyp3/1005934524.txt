the two towers and the central block appear as one construction when viewed from the city side thus it was possible to first lower all but one or two rods , leaving a small gap for their own men to slip through later on the city side it reads , '' spql '' and is framed by the years 1477 and 1871 , the former being the supposed date of construction ( the correct date is , however , now known to be 1478 ) , the latter being the date of the gate 's restoration and the founding of the german reich it would also have been pointless , since the view of the lower parts of the holsten gate from the city side was obscured by high walls on the field side there are accordingly only a few small windows the reasoning during construction may have been to be able to quickly destroy the gate from the city side in an emergency , so that it would not fall into enemy hands as a bulwark in each tower there were three gun chambers , one each on the ground , first and second floors the pediment was also not faithfully restored , but this is not the fault of the restorers , since in the 19th century it had long been gone and its original appearance was unknown today , three towers crown the pediment , but they are visible only from the city side two narrow spiral staircases wind their way upwards , in each case between the central building and the adjacent tower the ceiling of the north tower 's second floor has been removed , so that today the second and third upper storeys there share a common space these city gates were initially simple gates which were repeatedly strengthened over time so that they eventually all had an outer , middle and inner gate so the history of the holsten gate is actually the history of four consecutive gates , although only one of them is left one had to leave the city through this gate in order to get to the holsten bridge , which crossed the river it is not known when a gate was erected here for the first time it is likely that already at that time there was a gate and a city wall along the trave river there is good evidence for the appearance of the gate erected at that time in a woodcut of a view of the city of lübeck produced by elias diebel although this is a city view from the eastern , wakenitz side of the old inner city hill , the artist has folded out essential parts of the gate 's west side , so that they too become visible at an unknown date in the 17th century , the inner holsten gate was replaced by a smaller , simple half-timbered gate—possibly because no point was seen in having a strong inner gate in light of the strong outer fortifications which had been erected in the meantime the half-timbered gate was replaced by a simple iron gate in 1794 , which in turn was demolished in 1828 , together with the tollkeeper 's house and the city wall along the trave river in the 15th century the entire gate construction was considered to be inadequate for more history of the middle holsten gate see the section on demolition and restoration below it was constructed in the 16th century when a wall was built west of the middle holsten gate into which a gate was inserted the new gate obstructed the view of the middle holsten gate since its eastern exit was located only 20 metres from that construction its foregate was small compared with the approximately one hundred years older middle holsten gate , but much more richly decorated on the field side connected to the gate was the home of the wall master , who was responsible for the maintenance of the fortifications this gate existed for about 250 years and was in the end sacrificed to the railway ; it was demolished in 1853 to make room for the first lübeck train station and tracks at the beginning of the 17th century new city walls were built in front of the city moat , under the supervision of military engineer johhann von brüssel this gate was the last of the four holsten gates to be constructed and the first to disappear , namely in 1808 it was then considered to be only as a matter of time before the middle holsten gate , the only remaining of the four gates , would be torn down however , there was at that time also growing resistance to the destruction of old buildings changes were , however , also made which did not correspond with the original character of the gate , including the above-mentioned merging of north tower floors in the second half of the 20th century minor repairs were made to the holsten gate which are no longer in line with current standards for architectural conservation a swastika dating from 1934 was cut out and taken away by unknown parties a few days after the scaffolding was installed for the repairs it was considered to be the last swastika still remaining on a public building in germany and was supposed to be concealed with metal sheeting as part of the restoration work the two monumental iron statues of reclining lions placed in an area in front of the holsten gate designed by harry maasz date from 1823 and are unsigned the holsten gate square ( '' holstentorplatz '' ) is enclosed on one side by a branch of the deutsche bundesbank ; with new construction extending the original reichsbank building to the rear another pedestrian bridge over the upper trave river was completed in spring 2007 to provide a connection the university 's main building complex in the old city centre
