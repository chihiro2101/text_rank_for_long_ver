in most arthropods , however , it is often modified , occurring largely as a component of composite materials , such as in sclerotin , a tanned proteinaceous matrix , which forms much of the exoskeleton of insects in butterfly wing scales , chitin is organized into stacks of gyroids constructed of chitin photonic crystals that produce various iridescent colors serving phenotype signaling and communication for mating and foraging in addition , some social wasps , such as protopolybia chartergoides , orally secrete material containing predominantly chitin to reinforce the outer nest envelopes , composed of paper humans and other mammals have chitinase and chi3l1 that can degrade chitin ; they also possess several immune receptors that can recognize chitin and its degradation products in a pathogen-associated molecular pattern , initiating an immune response chitin is a good inducer of plant defense mechanisms for controlling diseases chitin is used in industry in many processes examples of the potential uses of chemically modified chitin in food processing include the formation of edible films and as an additive to thicken and stabilize foods and food emulsions processes to size and strengthen paper employ chitin and chitosan how chitin interacts with the immune system of plants and animals has been an active area of research , including the identity of key receptors with which chitin interacts , whether the size of chitin particles is relevant to the kind of immune response triggered , and mechanisms by which immune systems respond chitin nanofibers are extracted from crustacean waste and mushrooms for possible development of products in tissue engineering , medicine , and industry in 2020 , chitin was proposed for use in building structures , tools , and other solid objects from a composite material of chitin combined with martian soil
