his chief work , known in ancient greek as pyrrhoneioi logoi ( πυρρώνειοι λóγοι ) and often rendered into english as the pyrrhonian discourses or pyrrhonian principles , dealt primarily with man 's need to suspend judgment due to our epistemology limitations the overall aim of the book is to establish that there is no firm basis for cognition , either through sense-perception , or indeed through thought in the first discourse he differentiates between the pyrrhonists and the academics in almost precisely the following words not one of them has said either that all things are acatalepsy , or that they are cognitive , but that they are no more of this kind than of that , or that they are sometimes of this kind , sometimes not , or that for one person they are of this kind , for another person not of this kind , and for another person not even existent at all but the same thing is , it might be said , no more true than false , convincing than unconvincing , or existent or non-existent ; or sometimes the one , sometimes the other ; or of such a kind for one person but not for another above all , the pyrrhonists , by entertaining doubts about every thesis , maintain consistency and do not conflict with themselves , whereas the academics are unaware that they are conflicting with themselves for to make unambiguous assertions and denials , at the same time as stating as a generalization that no things are cognitive , introduces an undeniable conflict : how is it possible to recognize that this is true , this false , yet still entertain perplexity and doubt , and not make a clear choice of the one and avoidance of the other ? for if it is not known that this is good or bad , or that this is true but that false , and this existent but that non-existent , it must certainly be admitted that each of them is incognitive these similar considerations are set out by aenesidemus of aegae at the beginning of his discourses , to indicate the difference between the pyrrhonists and academics he goes on in the same discourse , the first , also to report in summary outline the entire way of life of the pyrrhonists these are as follows : different animals manifest different modes of perception ; similar differences are seen among individual men ; for the same man , information perceived with the senses is self-contradictory furthermore , it varies from time to time with physical changes in addition , this data differs according to local relations objects are known only indirectly through the medium of air , moisture , etc these objects are in a condition of perpetual change in colour , temperature , size and motion all perceptions are relative and interact one upon another our impressions become less critical through repetition and custom all men are brought up with different beliefs , under different laws and social conditions aenesidemus argues that experiences vary infinitely under circumstances whose importance to one another can not be accurately judged by human observers he therefore rejects any concept of absolute knowledge of reality , since each person has different perceptions , and they arrange their sense-gathered data in methods specific to themselves according to herakleitos , when we draw in this divine reason by means of respiration , we become rational
