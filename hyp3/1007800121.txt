the word catacombs comes from the latin root word catatumbas meaning either “ among the tombs ” or , according to other translations from the original late latin , “ next to the quarry ” the later translation stems from the first excavations done to create the catacombs system , which was conducted outside of rome near the quarry “ catacombs of rome – useful information – rome & vatican museums ” the etruscan civilization , which dominated a territory including the area which now includes rome from perhaps 900 to 100 bc , like many other european peoples , had buried its dead in excavated underground chambers , such as the tomb of the capitals , and less complex tumuli considerable tracts of the ancient roads leading out of rome and other roman cities , like the via appia to this day , had monumental tombs running alongside them despite widespread popular modern ideas , these tunnels were probably not used for regular worship at first , but simply for burial roman law forbade burial places within city limits and so all burial places , including the catacombs , were located outside the walls of the city they were carved in tufa , a type of volcanic rock which is relatively soft to dig into but subsequently hardens , christian catacombs existed as a burial ground for early christians accompanied by inscriptions and early wall art although catacombs were of jewish origin in the first century , by the end of the sixth century there were over 60 christian catacombs from the first to the sixth century , the art in roman christian catacombs progressively went into phases as well : an early phase , an old testament phase , and a new testament phase the fresco decorations provide the main surviving evidence for early christian art , and initially show typically roman styles used for decorating homes – with secular iconography adapted to a religious function the complex system of tunnels that would later be known as the catacombs were first excavated by the etruscan people that lived in the region predating the romans these quarries became the basis for later excavation , first by the romans for rock resources and then by the christians and jews for burial sites and mass graves at first , many still desired to be buried in chambers alongside the martyrs however , the practice of catacomb burial declined slowly , and the dead were increasingly buried in church cemeteries in the 6th century catacombs were used only for martyrs ’ memorial services , though some paintings were added as late as the 7th century , for example a saint stephen in the catacomb of commodilla the catacombs have become an important monument of the early christianity their name refers to the christian martyrs marcellinus and peter who , according to tradition , were buried here , near the body of st they consist of a vast underground burial area , at first in pagan then in christian use , housing various tombs of christian martyrs sited along the appian way , these catacombs were built after ad 150 , with some private christian hypogea and a funeral area directly dependent on the catholic church one of the smallest christian cemeteries , this has always been one of the most accessible catacombs and is thus one of the least preserved ( of the four original floors , the first is almost completely gone ) on the left hand end of the right hand wall of the nave of the primitive basilica , rebuilt in 1933 on ancient remains , arches to end the middle of the nave of the actual church , built in the 13th century , are visible , along with the outside of the apse of the chapel of the relics ;
