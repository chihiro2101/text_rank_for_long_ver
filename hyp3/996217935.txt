& nbsp ; 1485 edge was sufficiently impressed to encourage napier to make his own car and collaborated with harvey du cros , his former boss at dunlop , to form the motor power company , based in london , which agreed to buy napier 's entire output the first of an initial order of six , three each two-cylinder 8 & nbsp ; hp and four-cylinder 16 & nbsp ; hp , all with aluminum bodies by arthur mulliner of northampton and chain drive , was delivered 31 march 1900 ; edge paid £400 and sold at £500 napier & son limited , although it remained in effect a private company for the next few years by june 1900 , eight '' 16 hp '' s had been ordered , and edge entered one in the 837 & nbsp ; mi ( 1,350 & nbsp ; km ) paris-toulouse-paris race , with charles rolls ( co-founder of rolls-royce ) as riding mechanic called the '' 50 hp '' , only two or three were completed , including one for rolls edge entered one in the 1901 gordon bennett cup , only able to test it en route ( it was completed 25 may , only four days before the event ) , montague serving as his riding mechanic ; it overpowered its dunlops , and fitting new ( french ) tires led to disqualification , since they were not of the same nation of origin annual production reached 250 cars in 1903 , overwhelming the lambeth factory , so a move was made to a new plant at acton , in west london on 16 october of that year , napier announced a six-cylinder car for 1904 and became the first manufacturer to make a commercially successful six , a '' remarkably smooth and flexible '' vehicle 18 & nbsp ; hp 301 cu in ( 4.9-litre ) ( 101.6×101.6 & nbsp ; mm , 4×4 in ) with a three-speed gearbox and chain drive within five years , there were 62 makers of six-cylinder cars in britain alone , including the ford motor company 's 1906 model k ( london : grange-universal , 1985 ) napier 's 1902 win brought the gordon bennett hosting duties to the united kingdom , and the 1903 event was held south of dublin , with three shaft-driven napiers defending the british and irish honor , all in the ( later famous ) racing green : two 470 cubic inch ( 7708 & nbsp ; cc ) 45 & nbsp ; horsepower ( 33.5 & nbsp ; kw ) fours for charles jarrott and j hull ( 1974 ) it was a bad year for napier 's racing program ; a 35 & nbsp ; hp in the hands of colonel mark mayhew in the paris-madrid rally lost its steering and hit a tree edge , again with mcdonald , fared no better with the k5 in the 1904 gordon bennett in germany , but a new 920 cubic inch ( 15-litre ; 158.7×127 & nbsp ; mm , 6.25×5-inch ) six , the l48 , with an external radiator reminiscent of the cord 810 , set the fastest time at the velvet strand speed trials at portmarnock , ireland , in september , piloted by mcdonald by 1907 , 1200 & nbsp ; people were employed by napier and were making about a hundred cars a year , aided by continuing racing success when napier was no longer in racing , its lion aero engine was used by several land speed record contestants : malcolm campbell 's napier-campbell blue bird of 1927 and campbell-napier-railton blue bird of 1931 , segrave 's golden arrow of 1929 , and john cobb 's napier-railton and railton special , which held the record from 1939–64 napier & son limited went public and bought out edge 's distribution and sales company , s.f the latter soon went into voluntary liquidation and thus the manufacture and marketing of napier cars were united under a single organization early in the war , napier was contracted to build engines from other companies ' designs : initially the model raf 3 , a v-12 by royal aircraft factory , and then the v-8 sunbeam arab both proved to be rather unreliable , and in 1916 napier decided to design its own instead , an effort that led to the superb w-block 12-cylinder lion together with the engine work , this required enormous expansion of the company the t75 motor car would be napier 's last 187 were built in all by 1924 , and napier quit car production with a total of 4,258 built the last vehicle project was a three-wheeled tractor-trailer goods vehicle , but rather than produce this itself , the design was sold to scammell , which made several thousand starting from scratch , napier decided to use the new sleeve valve design in a much larger h-block 24-cylinder engine , soon to be known as the sabre at that point efforts were made to improve it , leading eventually to the sabre vii delivering 3,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 2,600 & nbsp ; kw ) , making it the most powerful engine in the world , from an engine much smaller than its competition during the war ( 1944 ) napier was asked by the royal navy to supply a diesel engine for use in its patrol boats , but the culverin 's 720 & nbsp ; hp ( 537 & nbsp ; kw ) was not nearly enough for its needs also during the second world war a six-cylinder 300 cubic inch road-vehicle engine was commissioned by the government , but this design was sold to leyland motors by 1945 napier had been taken over by english electric on 23 november 1942 along with every major aero engine company in the post-war era , napier turned to the jet turbine its first design , the naiad and double naiad was developed for various royal navy fleet air arm projects , but did not enter production napier continued in ramjet development for several years , typically working alongside the english electric aircraft design team in 1961 a new company napier aero engines limited was formed by d following the move of the aero engine business , d today napier is no longer in the engine business
