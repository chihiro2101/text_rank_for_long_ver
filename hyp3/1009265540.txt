the day was wasted without the senate ever getting to vote on a motion supporting the bill , but caesar eventually circumvented cato 's opposition by taking the measure to the tribal assembly , where it passed in the parliament of the united kingdom , a bill defeated by a filibustering manoeuvre may be said to have been '' talked out '' on friday 20 april 2007 , a private member 's bill aimed at exempting members of parliament from the freedom of information act was '' talked out '' by a collection of mps , led by liberal democrats simon hughes and norman baker who debated for five hours , therefore running out of time for the parliamentary day and '' sending the bill to the bottom of the stack '' however , since there were no other private members ' bills to debate , it was resurrected the following monday in january 2011 , labour peers , including most notably john prescott , were attempting to delay the passage of the parliamentary voting system and constituencies bill 2010 until after 16 february , the deadline given by the electoral commission to allow the referendum on the alternative vote to take place on 5 may in january 2012 , conservative and scottish national party mps used filibustering to successfully block the daylight savings bill 2010–12 , a private member 's bill that would put the uk on central european time in october 2016 conservative minister sam gyimah filibustered a bill sponsored by john nicolson of the scottish national party that would pardon historic convictions of homosexual activity ( which is no longer an offence ) , replacing an existing law that requires each pardon to be applied for separately this results in any additional motions receiving less time for debate by councillors instead forcing a vote by the council under closure rules since both houses of the australian parliament have strictly enforced rules on how long members may speak , filibusters are generally not possible , though this is not the case in some state parliaments the museum of australian democracy identifies the last filibuster at the federal level to be a 12-hour long speech ( including interruptions ) by senator albert gardiner in 1918 , in which he read the entire commonwealth electoral act 1918 , to which the labor party was opposed because it introduced preferential voting in response to this , senate speeches were limited to 20 minutes the following year ( there was already a limit on speeches in the house of representatives ) during the 2008 parnell–bressington filibuster , two members of the south australian legislative council spoke for 13 hours to filibuster '' to stall changes to workers ' compensation '' in opposition , tony abbott 's coalition ( australia ) used suspension of standing orders in 2012 for the purposes of talking at length on political issues , most commonly during question time against the labor government in august 2000 , new zealand opposition parties national and act delayed the voting for the employment relations bill by voting slowly , and in some cases in māori ( which required translation into english ) in 2009 , several parties staged a filibuster of the local government ( auckland reorganisation ) bill in opposition to the government setting up a new auckland council under urgency and without debate or review by select committee , by proposing thousands of wrecking amendments and voting in māori as each amendment had to be voted on and votes in māori translated into english in an attempt to prevent the passing of bill c-6 , which would have legislated the imposing of a four-year contract and pay conditions on the locked out canada post workers , the new democratic party ( ndp ) led a filibustering session which lasted for fifty-eight hours mps are allowed to give such speeches each time a vote takes place , and many votes were needed before the bill could be passed another example of filibuster in canada federally came in early 2014 when ndp mp and deputy leader david christopherson filibustered the government 's bill c-23 , the fair elections act at the procedure and house affairs committee his filibuster lasted several meetings the last of which he spoke for over 8 hours and was done to support his own motion to hold cross country hearings on the bill so mps could hear what the canadian public thought of the bill in the end , given that the conservative government had a majority at committee , his motion was defeated and the bill passed although with some significant amendments a second high-profile and uniquely implemented filibuster in the ontario legislature occurred in april 1997 , where the ontario new democratic party , then in opposition , tried to prevent the governing progressive conservatives ' bill 103 from taking effect the ontario liberal party also joined the filibuster with a smaller series of amendments ; a typical liberal amendment would give a historical designation to a named street the ndp then added another series of over 700 amendments , each proposing a different date for the bill to come into force on april 4 , exhausted and often sleepy government members inadvertently let one of the ndp amendments pass , and the handful of residents of cafon court in etobicoke were granted the right to a public consultation on the bill , although the government subsequently nullified this with an amendment of its own the liberal amendments were then voted down one by one , eventually using a similar abbreviated process , and the filibuster finally ended on april 11 an unusual example of filibustering occurred in march 2017 , when the governing liberal party of newfoundland and labrador had '' nothing else to do in the house of assembly '' and debated between only themselves about their own interim supply bill , after both the conservative and new democratic parties indicated they intended to vote in favour of the bill in the southern rhodesia legislative assembly , independent member dr ahrn palley staged a similar filibuster against the law and order maintenance bill on 22 november 1960 , although this took the form of moving a long series of amendments to the bill , and therefore consisted of multiple individual speeches interspersed with comments from other members it is not part of the us constitution , becoming theoretically possible with a change of senate rules only in 1806 , and never being used until 1837 rarely used for much of the senate 's first two centuries , it was changed first in 1959 , because of repeated filibusters of civil rights legislation , to reduce the number of votes required from the entire chamber to 2/3 of the senate on november 21 , 2013 , the then-democratic-controlled senate exercised the nuclear option , in a 52–48 vote , to require only a majority vote to end a filibuster of all executive and judicial nominees , excluding supreme court nominees , rather than the 3/5 of votes previously required in the united states house of representatives , the filibuster ( the right to unlimited debate ) was used until 1842 , when a permanent rule limiting the duration of debate was created minority party members subsequently used a disappearing quorum , where members would refuse to vote despite being present on the floor or walk out before a vote until 1890 , when speaker thomas brackett reed changed house rules to eliminate this as the membership of the house grew much larger than the senate , the house had acted earlier to control floor debate , and by extension , the delay and blocking of floor votes on february 7 , 2018 , minority leader nancy pelosi set a record for the longest speech on the house floor , speaking for eight hours and seven minutes in support of deferred action for childhood arrivals : she took advantage of the fact that the minority leader is allowed to speak indefinitely without interruption the french constitution gives the government two options to defeat such a filibuster the first one was originally the use of the article 49 paragraph 3 procedure , according to which the law was adopted except if a majority is reached on a non-confidence motion ( a reform of july 2008 resulted in this power being restricted to budgetary measures only , plus one time each ordinary session – i.e it also appeared that this privatisation law could be used by the left-wing in the presidential election of 2007 as a political argument as the absence of some pro-beijing camp legislators would mean an inadequate support for the passing of the bill , the pro-establishment camp filibustered along with michael suen , the then-secretary for constitutional affairs , the voting of the bill was delayed to the next day and that the absentees could cast their votes , filibustering is still an ongoing practice in hong kong by the pan-democratic party , but at the same time , the pan-democratic party are undergoing huge amounts of fire from the pro-beijing camp for making filibustering a norm in the legislative council south korean opposition lawmakers started a filibuster on february 23 , 2016 , to stall the anti-terrorism bill , which they claim will give too much power to the national intelligence service and result in invasions of citizens ' privacy
