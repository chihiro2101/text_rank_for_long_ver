where primary elections are organized by parties , not the administration , two types of primaries can generally be distinguished : closed primary all voters can take part in an open primary and may cast votes on a ballot of any party people may vote in a party 's primary only if they are registered members of that party prior to election day depending on the state , independents either make their choice of party primary privately , inside the voting booth , or publicly , by registering with any party on election day massachusetts allows unenrolled voters or members of minor parties to vote in the primary of either major party , but registration or party changes must be done no fewer than 20 days prior to the primary raiding consists of voters of one party crossing over and voting in the primary of another party , effectively allowing a party to help choose its opposition 's candidate the theory is that opposing party members vote for the weakest candidate of the opposite party in order to give their own party the advantage in the general election a primary in which the ballot is not restricted to candidates from one party , where the top two candidates advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation the united states is one of a handful of countries to select candidates through popular vote in a primary election system ; most other countries rely on party leaders or paid up party members to select candidates , as was previously the case in the u.s the selection of candidates for federal , state , and local general elections takes place in primary elections organized by the public administration for the general voting public to participate in for the purpose of nominating the respective parties ' official candidates ; state voters start the electoral process for governors and legislators through the primary process , as well as for many local officials from city councilors to county commissioners primaries can be used in nonpartisan elections to reduce the set of candidates that go on to the general election ( qualifying primary ) ) generally , if a candidate receives more than 50 % of the vote in the primary , he or she is automatically elected , without having to run again in the general election if no candidate receives a majority , twice as many candidates pass the primary as can win in the general election , so a single seat election primary would allow the top two primary candidates to participate in the general election following when a qualifying primary is applied to a partisan election , it becomes what is generally known as a blanket or louisiana primary : typically , if no candidate wins a majority in the primary , the two candidates receiving the highest pluralities , regardless of party affiliation , go on to a general election that is in effect a run-off supporters claimed it would bring back voter choice ; opponents said it would exclude third parties and independents from general election ballots , could result in democratic or republican-only races in certain districts , and would in fact reduce voter choice however , tactical voting is sometimes a concern in non-partisan primaries as members of the opposite party can party raiding in order to face an easier general election president and county central committee offices , all candidates running in a primary election regardless of party will appear on a single primary election ballot and voters may vote for any candidate , with the top two vote-getters overall moving on to the general election regardless of party

the united states , iowa and new hampshire have drawn attention every four years because they hold the first caucus and primary election , respectively , and often give a candidate the momentum to win their party 's nomination the democratic national committee ( dnc ) proposed a new schedule and a new rule set for the 2008 presidential primary elections among the changes : the primary election cycle would start nearly a year earlier than in previous cycles , states from the west and the south would be included in the earlier part of the schedule , and candidates who run in primary elections not held in accordance with the dnc 's proposed schedule ( as the dnc does not have any direct control over each state 's official election schedules ) would be penalized by being stripped of delegates won in offending states president who seek their party 's nomination participate in primary elections run by state governments , or caucuses run by the political parties the more open the system , the greater the chance of raiding , or voters voting in the other party 's primary in hopes of getting a weaker opponent chosen to run against a strong candidate in the general election

election all the same , the event played a role in the elimination of candidates : there were cases when the current deputies of the state duma , having seen that they did not enjoy the support of electors , withdrew their candidacies in 2016 , the primaries for the selection of candidates for parliamentary elections were held by four parties : united russia , people 's freedom party , предварительное голосование « волна перемен » парнас the party of growth and the green alliance the most massive were the 22 may 2016 primaries of the united russia , which could vote for every citizen who has an active electoral right however , the primaries , as well as earlier , were not binding for the leadership of united russia : a number of winners of the primaries were withdrawn by the leadership without any explanation of reasons , and in 18 single-seat constituencies the party did not nominate any candidates however , voting for candidates will take place via the internet within three months , and , according to the spokesman of the party , the results of the primaries will not be mandatory for the nomination of the candidate and the party convention may nominate another candidate who does not even participate in the primaries , or even not nominate candidates and support president vladimir putin , if he decides to be re-elected for the 2010 general election , the conservative party used open primaries to select two candidates for member of parliament further open primaries were used to select some conservative candidates for the 2015 general election , and there are hopes other parties may nominate future candidates in this way with a view to the european elections , many european political party consider organising a presidential primary parties are

primary elections ) in canada are not organized by the public administration but by parties themselves typically , in the months before an anticipated general election , local riding associations of political parties in each electoral district will schedule and announce a nomination meeting ( similar to a nominating caucus in the united states ) would-be candidates will then file nomination papers with the association , and usually will devote time to solicit existing party members , and to sign up new party members who will also support them at the nomination meeting at times , party headquarters may overturn an association 's chosen candidate ; for example , if any scandalous information about the candidate comes to light after the nomination a party headquarters may also ''
