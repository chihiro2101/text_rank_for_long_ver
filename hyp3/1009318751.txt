suppose that a piece of information about the value of a stock ( say , about a future merger ) is widely available to investors for example , suppose that the piece of information in question says that a financial crisis is likely to come soon by contrast , the price signals in markets are far less subject to individual biases highlighted by the behavioral finance programme further empirical work has highlighted the impact transaction costs have on the concept of market efficiency , with much evidence suggesting that any anomalies pertaining to market inefficiencies are the result of a cost benefit analysis made by those willing to incur the cost of acquiring the valuable information in order to trade on it consequently , a situation arises where either the asset pricing model is incorrect or the market is inefficient , but one has no way of knowing which is the case further tests of portfolio efficiency by gibbons , ross and shanken ( 1989 ) ( gjr ) led to rejections of the capm , although tests of efficiency inevitably run into the joint hypothesis problem ( see roll 's critique ) he says preponderance of value investing among the world 's money managers with the highest rates of performance rebuts the claim of emh proponents that luck is the reason some investors appear more successful than others he argues that , taken at face value , the theory makes the banal claim that the average investor will not beat the market average—which is a tautology when pressed on this point , pinkington argues that emh proponents will usually say that any actual investor will converge with the average investor given enough time and so no investor will beat the market average but pilkington points out that when proponents of the theory are presented with evidence that a small minority of investors do , in fact , beat the market over the long-run , these proponents then say that these investors were simply 'lucky ' peter lynch , a mutual fund manager at fidelity investments who consistently more than doubled market averages while managing the magellan fund , has argued that the emh is contradictory to the random walk hypothesis—though both concepts are widely taught in business schools without seeming awareness of a contradiction joel tillinghast , also a fund manager at fidelity with a long history of outperforming a benchmark , has written that the core arguments of the emh are '' more true than not '' and he accepts a '' sloppy '' version of the theory allowing for a margin of error columbia business school publishing but he also contends the emh is not completely accurate or accurate in all cases , given the recurrent existence of economic bubbles ( when some assets are dramatically overpriced ) and the fact that value investing ( who focus on underpriced assets ) have tended to outperform the broader market over long periods tillinghast also asserts that even staunch emh proponents will admit weaknesses to the theory when assets are significantly over- or under-priced , such as double or half their value according to fundamental analysis noted financial journalist roger lowenstein blasted the theory , declaring '' the upside of the current great recession is that it could drive a stake through the heart of the academic nostrum known as the efficient-market hypothesis '' former federal reserve chairman paul volcker chimed in , saying it 's '' clear that among the causes of the recent financial crisis was an unjustified faith in rational expectations and market efficiencies '' one financial analyst noted '' by 2007–2009 , you had to be a fanatic to believe in the literal truth of the emh martin wolf , the chief economics commentator for the financial times , dismissed the hypothesis as being a useless way to examine how markets function in reality the theory of efficient markets has been practically applied in the field of securities class action litigation efficient market theory , in conjunction with '' fraud-on-the-market theory '' , has been used in securities class action litigation to both justify and as mechanism for the calculation of damages , the use of efficient market theory in supporting securities class action litigation was affirmed adaptive market hypothesis financial market efficiency dumb agent theory index fund insider trading investment theory noisy market hypothesis perfect market transparency ( market ) random walk hypothesis proof that properly discounted present values of assets vibrate randomly paul samuelson human behavior and the efficiency of the financial system ( 1999 ) by robert j
