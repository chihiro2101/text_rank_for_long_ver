the dc-3 resulted from a marathon telephone call from american airlines ceo c raymond over the next two years , and the prototype dst ( douglas sleeper transport ) first flew on december 17 , 1935 ( the 32nd anniversary of the wright brothers ' flight at kitty hawk ) with douglas chief test pilot carl cover at the controls there was no prototype dc-3 , and the first dc-3 built followed seven dsts off the production line for delivery to american airlines early-production civilian aircraft used either the nine-cylinder wright r-1820 cyclone or the fourteen-cylinder pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp , but the twin wasp was chosen for most military versions and was also used by most dc-3s converted from military service five dc-3s super dc-3s with pratt & whitney r-2000 twin wasps were built in the late 1940s , three of which entered airline service production was as follows : 607 civil variants of the dc-3 ; 10,048 military c-47 and c-53 derivatives built at santa monica , california , long beach , california , and oklahoma city ; 4,937 built under license in the soviet union ( 1939–1950 ) as the lisunov li-2 ( nato reporting name : cab ) ; 487 mitsubishi kinsei-engined aircraft built by showa and nakajima in japan ( 1939–1945 ) , as the showa/nakajima l2d ( allied codename tabby ) production of dsts ended in mid-1941 and civil dc-3 production ended in early 1943 , although dozens of the dsts and dc-3s ordered by airlines that were produced between 1941 and 1943 were pressed into the us military service while still on the production line only five super dc-3s were built , and three of them were delivered for commercial use a nonprofit group , flagship detroit foundation , continues to operate the only original american airlines flagship dc-3 with air show and airport visits throughout the u.s in 1936 , klm royal dutch airlines received its first dc-3 , which replaced the dc-2 in service from amsterdam via batavia ( now jakarta ) to sydney , by far the world 's longest scheduled route at the time flightglobal archive ( april 18 , 1953 ) flightglobal archive ( november 14 , 1946 ) douglas developed an improved version , the super dc-3 , with more power , greater cargo capacity , and an improved wing , but with surplus aircraft available for cheap , they failed to sell well in the civil aviation market navy had 100 of its early r4ds converted to super dc-3 standard during the early 1950s as the r4d-8 , later c-117d the united states forest service used the dc-3 for smoke jumping and general transportation until the last example was retired in december 2015 a number of aircraft companies attempted to design a '' dc-3 replacement '' over the next three decades ( including the very successful fokker f27 ) , but no single type could match the versatility , rugged reliability , and economy of the dc-3 it remained a significant part of air transport systems well into the 1970s perhaps unique among prewar aircraft , the dc-3 continues to fly in active commercial and military service as of 2021 , eighty six years after the type 's first flight in 1935 a common saying among aviation enthusiasts and pilots is '' the only replacement for a dc-3 is another dc-3 '' the oldest dc-3 still flying is the original american airlines flagship detroit ( c/n 1920 , the 43rd aircraft off the santa monica production line , delivered on 2 march 1937 ) , pearcy 1987 p the base price of a new dc-3 in 1936 was around 60,000– 80,000 , and by 1960 used examples were available for 75,000 ;
