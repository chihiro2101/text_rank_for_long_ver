many early scientists attributed the magnetism of lodestones to two different '' magnetic fluids '' ( '' effluvia '' ) , a north-pole fluid at one end and a south-pole fluid at the other , which attracted and repelled each other in analogy to positive and negative electric charge however , an improved understanding of electromagnetism in the nineteenth century showed that the magnetism of lodestones was properly explained not by magnetic monopole fluids , but rather by a combination of electric currents , the electron magnetic moment , and the magnetic moments of other particles in some theoretical models , magnetic monopoles are unlikely to be observed , because they are too massive to create in particle accelerators ( see below ) , and also too rare in the universe to enter a particle detector with much probability the ends of a flux tube form a magnetic dipole , but since they move independently , they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic monopole quasiparticles all matter ever isolated to date , including every atom on the periodic table and every particle in the standard model , has zero magnetic monopole charge second , many elementary particles have an intrinsic magnetic moment , the most important of which is the electron magnetic dipole moment , which is related to its spin ( physics ) a magnetic monopole , if it exists , would have the defining property of producing a magnetic field whose monopole term is non-zero in an electric dipole made of ordinary matter , the positive charge is made of protons and the negative charge is made of electrons , but a magnetic dipole does not have different types of matter creating the north pole and south pole the fact that the electric and magnetic fields can be written in a symmetric way is specific to the fact that space is three-dimensional if magnetic charges do not exist & nbsp ; – or if they do exist but are not present in a region of space & nbsp ; – then the new terms in maxwell 's equations are all zero , and the extended equations reduce to the conventional equations of electromagnetism such as ) ; instead , they are sources for other fields , for example the -field , the '' -field '' ( related to superfluid vorticity ) , or various other quantum fields there are a number of examples in condensed-matter physics where collective behavior leads to emergent phenomena that resemble magnetic monopoles in certain respects , making magnetic monopoles , and other exotica , in the lab , symmetry breaking , january 29 , 2009 some researchers use the term magnetricity to describe the manipulation of magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice , in analogy to the word “ electricity ” using an applied magnetic field to break the symmetry of the system , the researchers were able to control the density and orientation of these strings in another example , a paper in the february 11 , 2011 issue of nature physics describes creation and measurement of long-lived magnetic monopole quasiparticle currents in spin ice they thus derived the microscopic parameters of monopole motion in spin ice and identified the distinct roles of free and bound magnetic charges this constitutes the first example of a quasi-magnetic monopole observed within a system governed by quantum field theory
