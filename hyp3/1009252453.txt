joseph nye , soft power : the means to success in world politics it is also considered the '' second face of power '' that indirectly allows you to obtain the outcomes you want a country 's soft power , according to nye , rests on three resources : '' its culture ( in places where it is attractive to others ) , its political values ( when it lives up to them at home and abroad ) , and its foreign policies ( when others see them as legitimate and having moral authority ) soft power : the means to success in world politics ( new york : public affairs , 2004 ) p soft power is hampered when policies , culture , or values repel others instead of attracting them in his book , nye argues that soft power is a more difficult instrument for governments to wield than hard power for two reasons : many of its critical resources are outside the control of governments , and soft power tends to '' work indirectly by shaping the environment for policy , and sometimes takes years to produce the desired outcomes the book identifies three broad categories of soft power : '' culture '' , '' political values '' , and '' policies neorealist and other rationalist and neorationalist authors ( with the exception of stephen walt ) dismiss soft power out of hand as they assert that actors in international relations respond to only two types of incentives : economic incentives and force since nye 's approach '' mainly focuses on how to get others to do your biding '' , some researchers argued that rising powers , such as china , are creating new approaches to soft power , thus using it defensively the index is said to measure the soft power resources of countries , and does not translate directly into ability influence the ranking is based on '' the quality of a country ’ s political institutions , the extent of their cultural appeal , the strength of their diplomatic network , the global reputation of their higher education system , the attractiveness of their economic model , and a country ’ s digital engagement with the world the success of soft power heavily depends on the actor 's reputation within the international community , as well as the flow of information between actors thus , soft power is often associated with the rise of globalization and neoliberalism ( international relations ) the high prominence of the us in international news , for example , has been linked to its soft power '' subsequently , russia attempted to attribute some of the influence to the united states , this was seen to be a propaganda exercise designed to damage the uk 's international prestige and found to be untrue following statements by the various states as well as the entirety of the european union america 's early commitment to religious tolerance , for example , was a powerful element of its overall appeal to potential immigrants ; and american aid in the reconstruction of europe after world war ii was a propaganda victory to show off the prosperity and the generosity of the people of the united states
