according to his future wife marie-catherine , she first set eyes on the young landru at mass one sunday in 1887 '' landru and marie-catherine 's first child marie was born illegitimately in 1891 , shortly after landru began three years ' obligatory military service in the northern french town of saint-quentin , rising from private to the position of deputy quartermaster in the autumn of 1893 he returned to paris and married marie-catherine , who was already pregnant with their second child maurice in a later newspaper interview , marie-catherine described landru as '' a model husband '' and father in the early years of their marriage , even though she also told police that he was '' a skirt chaser '' from the very beginning meanwhile , he was constantly on the run from police , seeing little of his family and lying low for a year in le havre she also said that in the autumn of 1912 , as soon as he was released from prison , landru stole around 12,000 francs ( approximately 40,000 in modern money ) that his father had pointedly left her and the four children , rather than him he went on the run in april 1914 with all this money , plus most of his father 's inheritance , just before the police came to arrest him taking his previous convictions into account , the court sentenced landru to four years hard labour followed by exile for life on the french pacific island of new caledonia she knew him at this stage as '' raymond diard '' , an industrialist from northern france , who had promised to marry her and had persuaded her to give up her job making lingerie for a dress shop in paris the balance of jeanne 's relationship with landru changed completely in early august 1914 when french entry into world war i landru failed to make a rendezvous with jeanne , who had returned to paris to be with andré , still living in her old apartment in despair , jeanne went back to the house near chantilly , accompanied by andré and her brother-in-law , hoping to find the man she still knew as '' diard '' the next day , jeanne visited landru 's abandoned apartment in southern paris where she discovered that he was a criminal on the run who should have been deported to new caledonia over christmas , jeanne wrote to a woman friend in paris , explaining that it would not be convenient to visit her in vernouillet because of the poor weather : '' at the moment the place is rather muddy '' jeanne cuchet letter to mme morin , 4 january 1915 , yvelines archives , carton 2u 769/2760 in mid-january , andré learned to his joy that his scheduled recruitment to the army had been brought forward two years to the summer of 1915 he wrote to a friend in the army on 20 january , reporting his good news , and another to an uncle a week later landru 's subsequent murders between 1915 and 1919 were presented chronologically at his trial , creating the false impression that he had met the women in the order in which he killed them in fact , one of his known victims had been '' engaged '' to the married landru for more than two years before he murdered her , a period during which he killed at least five other women ; another victim had known him for more than a year-and-a-half before she disappeared ; while his last known victim , a prostitute , may have first encountered landru as early as 1914 it was also taken for granted by the police and the prosecution that he had recorded the total number of his victims in a list of 11 names and code-names he had written at the back of a little black notebook ( known in french as a carnet ) which was discovered immediately after his arrest landru did not acquire the carnet until the spring of 1915 , more than a year after he first met jeanne cuchet , his first known victim she met landru either through a lonely hearts advertisement he placed on 1 may 1915 in le journal , a mass circulation daily , or through a notice applying for a position as a lady 's companion which she placed in another newspaper anna was a clever , attractive widow who worked as a typist at an insurance company in paris and had had a string of lovers since the death of her alcoholic , bankrupt husband a decade earlier landru , alias georges frémyet , became '' engaged '' to célestine immediately , but then put off their marriage for more than two years , pleading lost identity documents and long '' business trips '' abroad at landru 's trial , the prosecution claimed that he first met the heavily indebted marie-thérèse in october 1918 after she advertised to sell her furniture secondly , landru 's wife and four children knew his whereabouts throughout the war but shielded him from the police ‘ déclaration de landru , charles , dit frémyet , charles , 14 april 1919 , paris police archives , carton ja 28 his eldest son maurice , born in 1894 , was mobilised in the summer of 1915 and arrested soon afterwards for various frauds and thefts , including the receipt and sale of valuables from landru that had belonged to his first known victim , jeanne cuchet following his release from prison , maurice helped landru concoct a cover story to explain the disappearance of his sixth known victim , anna collomb , to one of anna 's friends meanwhile , landru 's wife lived for most of the war in the northwestern paris suburb of clichy under the false name '' frémyet '' ( one of landru 's aliases ) in an apartment where he was seen coming and going at regular intervals landru 's wife forged the signature of his eighth known victim , célestine buisson , so he could gain access to célestine 's bank account , and impersonated his ninth known victim , louise jaume , for the same purpose indeed , it is arguable that landru might never have been arrested without the persistence of another woman who forced the authorities to investigate the suspicious man who rented the villa tric outside gambais over the next two years , marie began to suspect that célestine 's fiancé was a marriage swindler , out to get his hands on the naive célestine 's savings ‘ audition de marie lacoste ’ , 12 april 1919 , yvelines archives , carton 2u771/4695 célestine refused to take marie 's advice to end her engagement to '' frémyet '' and the two siblings were scarcely on speaking terms when they returned to paris during the autumn of 1917 , landru became increasingly worried that marie might suspect him of célestine 's murder still worried , landru turned up alone on several occasions at marie 's workplace to invite her to dinner with célestine at célestine 's apartment in paris each time , marie refused , eventually telling landru to get lost and not to come back célestine 's son had been blinded during the war and from his home in southwest france , had tried to contact célestine to borrow money , following what he called a '' serious accident '' marie visited célestine 's old apartment , where the concierge told her that célestine had last been seen there in the summer of 1917 and that at least one other woman had subsequently spent the night at the address with '' frémyet '' before he paid off the lease on 11 january 1919 , marie took her dossier to her local police station in paris , accompanied by a fellow maid called laure bonhoure who had seen landru when he had visited the house where they worked the next day , marie wrote to the mayor of gambais in her best formal french , forgetting her full stops as she raced on : “ you have in your commune a house at about 100 metres from the church , which is called the maison tric , the name of the owner , i do not know him , but the house was rented in 1917 , to a gentleman around 40 years old , who had a long brown beard and who has as his name monsieur frémyet ” marie lacoste letter to the mayor of gambais , 12 january 1919 , paris police archives , dossier buisson the mayor denied any knowledge of célestine or a man called frémyet living at the maison ( or villa ) tric this claim was well short of the truth , because the mayor recognised the man described accurately by marie by another of landru 's aliases : '' raoul dupont '' however , belin only had an arrest warrant for a man called '' frémyet '' , so decided to go home for the night jean monteilhet , witness statement , 6 may 1919 , paris police archives , affaire landru , dossier général the doctor did not testify at landru 's trial , pleading illness , but the prosecution acknowledged that his sighting did not fit the timeline of the known disappearances ; about six months after the presumed murder of landru 's fifth known fiancée and six months before the death of the next victim on the charge sheet two days after landru 's arrest , charles also admitted assisting his father with unexplained '' gardening work '' at landru 's house in vernouillet in early 1915 , around the time that jeanne and andré cuchet disappeared in january 1917 , following his release from a military prison , maurice assisted his father in creating a cover story to explain the disappearance of the sixth missing woman , anna collomb landru 's wife marie catherine forged at least one of the missing women 's signatures so landru could gain access to his victim 's bank savings under interrogation , marie catherine initially protested her innocence , claiming her only crime had been '' to love my husband too much '' however , bonin never formally charged them and in july 1920 they were released from custody – in marie-catherine 's case on medical grounds ( she had a bad back ) and in maurice 's case because according to bonin , his continuing detention was not helpful to the investigation it appears more likely that bonin decided a jury would struggle to believe that marie-catherine and maurice had known nothing about the murders , given their clear involvement in landru 's thefts in particular : bank records proved that the first woman to disappear , jeanne cuchet , had been almost broke '' examen de landru au point de vue mental '' , 25 june 1920 , paris police archives , dossier général they produced no substantive clinical evidence to support their new diagnosis , which was possibly the result of pressure from bonin to bring landru to trial rather than send him to an asylum however , moro was also a passionate opponent of the death penalty and did not believe that the prosecution could remotely prove that landru had certainly killed the 10 women and one young man on the murder charge sheet the defence would not contest the multiple charges of theft and fraud ( even though landru denied them ) , which would be enough to send landru for the rest of his life into exile with hard labour in french guyana – an ordeal which would probably kill him before long , given landru 's poor physical health he itemised eight '' proofs '' which in his view demonstrated landru 's guilt beyond all doubt , from the one-way train tickets landru had bought the women on their last known journey to gambais to the killer 's tell-tale noting of the hour they disappeared – '' the hour of the execution '' landru 's notorious oven , in which he allegedly burnt the remains of his victims , was sold at auction in 1923 to a businessman who wanted to put it on display in the italian city of turin , beyond french jurisdiction beside the oven , landru had written : “ one can burn anything one wants in there ” – a remark attributed to him by a woman who had survived a visit to the house
