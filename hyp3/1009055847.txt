thumb the geforce 2 architecture is similar to the previous geforce 256 line but with various improvements on september 29 , 2000 nvidia started shipping graphics cards which had 16 and 32 mb of video memory size the ultra model actually outperforms the first geforce 3 products in some cases , due to initial geforce 3 cards having significantly lower fillrate however , the ultra loses its lead when anti-aliasing is enabled , because of the geforce 3 's new memory bandwidth/fillrate efficiency mechanisms ; plus the geforce 3 has a superior next-generation feature set with programmable vertex and pixel shaders for directx 8.0 games on their 2001 product web page , nvidia initially placed the ultra as a separate offering from the rest of the geforce 2 lineup ( gts , pro , ti ) , however by late 2002 with the geforce 2 considered a discontinued product line , the ultra was included along the gts , pro , and ti in the geforce 2 information page in order to create a better low-end option , nvidia created the geforce 2 mx series , which offered a set of standard features , specific to the entire geforce 2 generation , limited only by categorical tier the mx series also provided dual-display support , something not found in the regular geforce 256 and geforce 2 further , the radeon ve featured only a single rendering pipeline , causing it to produce a substantially lower fillrate than the geforce 2 mx the non-mx geforce 2 line was reduced in price and saw the addition of the geforce 2 ti , in order to offer a mid-range alternative to the high-end geforce 3 product geforce 2 gts , geforce 2 pro , geforce 2 ti and geforce 2 ultra : windows 9x & windows me : 71.84 released on march 11 , 2005 ; download ; : product support list windows 95/98/me â€“ 71.84
