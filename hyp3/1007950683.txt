the robustness of pcc as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis ( scheme 3 ) the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them protecting groups ; georg thieme verlag : germany , 2000 in the field of complex molecule synthesis , tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the silicon-based protecting groups ( scheme 4 ) tips protecting groups were also pioneered by corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection the most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as tbs ether , but longer reaction times are generally needed the formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced umpolung chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis ( scheme 8 ) 1,3-dithianes are also used as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds expressing the versatility and utility of this functional group corey established the details of the remarkable cyclization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene several reactions developed in corey 's lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry at least 302 methods have been developed in the corey group since 1950 see the methods tab several reactions have been named after him : corey-itsuno reduction , also known as the corey-bakshi-shibata reduction , is an enantioselective reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols strategic applications of named reactions in organic synthesis ; elsevier : burlington , 2005 enantioselective chemical synthesis ; direct book publishing : dallas , 2010 later , corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a 6-membered ring transition state , leading to a four-membered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst the reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists ( scheme 11 ) the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and co-workers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a borane-dimethylsulfide complex more recently , a one-pot synthesis using a modified procedure has been developed its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility more importantly , stereospecfic alkenes are present in several natural products as the method continues to be exploited to yield a series of complex substrates after the development of this reaction the cbs reagent proved to be a very versatile reagent for a series of several powerful synthetic transformations the use of a chiral lewis acid such as the cbs catalyst includes a broad range of unsaturated enones substrates the reaction likely proceeds via a highly organized 6-membered ring pre-transition state to deliver highly enantio-enriched products ( scheme 17 ) the diels-alder reaction is one of the most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry the synthesis of natural products using the diels-alder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of six-membered rings ( scheme 18 ) one big advantage of this reaction is that it is performed under neutral conditions allowing the presence of acid and base-labile functional groups to date rings of 7 to 48 members have been successfully synthesized using this method one of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone ( scheme 20 ) two sulfur ylide variants have been employed that give different chemeoselective products ( scheme 21 ) based on their reactivity , another distinct advantage of these two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity corey and his research group have completed many total synthesis at least 265 compounds have been synthesized in the corey group since 1950 one of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a 9:1 mixture of the desired diastereomer ( scheme 24 ) the pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the diels-alder structural goal , which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring corey and lászló kürti , enantioselective chemical synthesis : methods , logic , and practice , direct book publishing llc , 2010 , elias james corey , xue-min cheng as a result of altom 's death , the department of chemistry accepted a proposal allowing graduate students to ask two additional faculty members to play a small advisory role in preparing a thesis woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed ( homo ) molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene → 1,3-butadiene and 1,3,5-hexatriene → cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the woodward–hoffmann rules
