māori settled the islands and developed a distinct culture over several hundred years the concept of tapu ( meaning taboo or sacred ) is also a strong force in māori culture , applied to objects , people , or even mountains however their population began to increase again from the late nineteenth century , and a cultural revival began in the 1960s , sometimes known as the māori renaissance pākehā culture ( usually synonymous with new zealand european culture ) derives mainly from that of the british , particularly english settlers who colonised new zealand in the nineteenth century until about the 1950s many pākehā saw themselves as a british people , and retained strong cultural ties to '' mother england '' the largely rural life in early new zealand led to the image of new zealanders being rugged , industrious problem solvers it has been claimed that pākehā do not actually have a culture , or if they do it is not a distinct one part of the problem is that high culture is often mistaken for culture in general , and the lack of recognition historically given to new zealand 's artists , writers and composers is seen as evidence of a lack of culture from the 1980s pākehā began to further explore their distinctive traditions and to argue that new zealanders had a culture which was neither māori nor british ethnic communities within new zealand retain features of their own cultures , and these have , in some areas , spread to become popular with the general population various aspects of each culture have added to new zealand culture ; chinese new year is celebrated for example , especially in auckland and dunedin , and south auckland has strong samoan cultural links the popular music style of urban pasifika also has its origins in the new zealand pacific island community , and has become a major strand in new zealand music culture from the 1830s many māori nominally converted to christianity and in the process learned to read and write , by the late nineteenth century new zealand when formal schooling finished for most at 12 , māori were as likely to be literate as pākehā after the defeat of rebel māori who attempted to establish a renegade state in the king country , the adoption of pākehā culture became less of a free choice as pākehā began to outnumber māori together they formed the young māori party which was very influential in starting improved health and education for māori māori traditional culture became less critical in normal everyday life as advanced western technology- electricity , lights telegraphy , roads , mass production radio , aeroplanes and refrigeration made most aspects of māori culture redundant but was still practised at events such as tangihanga ( funerals ) from the early twentieth century and especially from the 1970s , māori activists began to protest against eurocentrism and demanded equal recognition for their own culture many māori have become successful practitioners of european-derived art forms ; indeed many of new zealand 's biggest arts success stories are māori or part māori since the late nineteenth century , pākehā have used māori cultural practices when they required something distinctive the most famous example of this is the haka of the all blacks , a māori posture dance which is performed before international rugby matches ( there are many non-māori polynesian all blacks , thus making this a multi-ethnic borrowing ) however pākehā artists such as colin mccahon and gordon walters have also incorporated māori motifs into their art , and a number of early pākehā writers used māori themes and topics in an effort to create an authentically new zealand literature the tourist industry has also made heavy use of māori culture in an effort to present tourists with distinctly new zealand experiences and items many pākehā in other countries use an aspect of māori culture to express their new zealandness ) for many years pākehā did not consult māori over the use of their culture , and māori generally did not protest loudly unless a symbol was being used in a particularly inappropriate way however , despite some māori people business and intellectual property this does not always occur and forms are still sometimes used in inappropriate ways some pākehā have been deeply involved in the revival of otherwise lost māori arts in the performance of traditional māori musical instruments richard nunns has earned wide respect , as have the contributions made by many academics , for example , dame anne salmond in the area of traditional rituals of encounter , or mervyn mclean in the analysis of traditional song both māori and pākehā have borrowed cultural forms and styles from other countries , particularly britain and the united states although there is evidence of a '' new zealand style '' , many groups incorporate new zealand themes into their work , so this style affects each genre differently in general , the development of international mass media and mass communication has meant new zealanders have always been aware of developments in other countries ; this lends itself to the adoption of new forms and styles from overseas other languages are also spoken in new zealand by some immigrant communities new zealand english is close to australian english in pronunciation , but has several differences often overlooked by people from outside these countries some of these differences show new zealand english to have more affinity with the english of southern england than australian english does several of the differences also show the influence of māori speech the new zealand accent also has some scottish and irish influences from the large number of settlers from those places during the 19th century new zealand sign language has its roots in british sign language ( bsl ) , and may be technically considered a dialect of british , australian and new zealand sign language ( banzsl ) new zealand sign language became an official language of new zealand in april 2006 about 20,000 people use new zealand sign language new zealand has two 'high culture ' traditions : māori and western because of this and new zealand 's small population , most new zealand artists , performers and writers struggle to make a living from their art a number of māori artists , including paratene matchitt and shane cotton have combined western modernism with traditional māori art the haka ( often mistaken as always being a war dance or ritual challenge ) has become part of wider new zealand culture , being performed by the all blacks as a group ritual before international games and by homesick new zealanders of all races who want to express their new zealandness new zealand drama , both on stage and screen , has been plagued during much of its history by cost and lack of popular interest in new zealand culture many māori members of mainstream churches , and those with no particular religion , continue to believe in tapu , particularly where the dead are concerned , although not to the same extent as their ancestors until about the 1980s it was often claimed that new zealand was a 'classless society' '' does nz still cut down tall poppies ? '' , 18 march 2013 , adrien taylor , 3news.co.nz it has been argued that in new zealand ethnicity takes the place of class , with māori and other polynesians earning less , having a lower standard of living and less education , and working in lower status jobs than pākehā the three most common destinations are australia , great britain and europe , although recently trips to asian countries such as south korea and japan to teach english have become increasingly popular the length of the visit can range from a few months to the remainder of the visitor 's life ; since many new zealanders have british ancestry or dual citizenship ( sometimes as a result of their parents ' oe ) , the restrictions on working in britain do not apply to a substantial percentage of them because australia is relatively close to new zealand and has no restrictions on new zealanders working there , the new zealanders working in australia are more diverse than those in other countries , with a significantly higher proportion of māori and working-class people since the signing of the trans-tasman travel arrangement in 1973 , new zealanders have had the right to live and work in australia on equal terms with australian citizens the stereotypical new zealand male is essentially a pioneer type : he is perceived to be rural , strong , unemotional , democratic , has little time for high culture , good with animals ( particularly horses ) and machines , and is able to turn his hand to nearly anything this type of man is often presumed to be a unique product of new zealand 's colonial period but he shares many similarities with the stereotypical american frontiersman and australian bushman new zealand men are supposed to still have many of these qualities , even though most new zealanders have lived in urban areas since the late nineteenth century abortion in new zealand is subject to more restrictions than it is in many western societies new zealanders , both those of pākehā and māori roots , have been described as an individualistic people , who take intrusion very personally , especially when it occurs onto private land ( but also sometimes in a wider sense ) according to psychologists , this is rooted respectively in the 'frontier ' image of the european settler culture , but also mirrored amongst the māori , for whom land holds a lot of spiritual value in addition to its commercial use a major difference between british and pākehā food was that meat was more readily available to all social classes in new zealand new zealanders increasingly come from many ethnic backgrounds , and most immigrants to new zealand have tried to reproduce their native cuisines or national dishes in new zealand ethnic restaurants have served as community meeting places and have also given other new zealanders a chance to try different cuisines the evolution of café culture has been a major part of growth within new zealand cafés and the perfection of espresso coffee making throughout most of new zealand have led to a unique part of the life of the country
