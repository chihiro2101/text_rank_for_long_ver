'' ( given in a vertical plane two points a and b ( see figure 5 ) , assign to the moving body m , the path amb , by means of which — descending by its own weight and beginning to be moved by gravity from point a — it would arrive at the other point b in the shortest time ) solutions to johann bernoulli 's problem of 1696 : isaac newton ( january 1697 ) '' de ratione temporis quo grave labitur per rectam data duo puncta conjungentem , ad tempus brevissimum quo , vi gravitatis , transit ab horum uno ad alterum per arcum cycloidis '' ( on a proof that the time in which a weight slides by a line joining two given points is the shortest in terms of time when it passes , via gravitational force , from one of these points to the other through a cycloidal arc ) , philosophical transactions of the royal society of london , 19 : 424-425 '' ( his communication together with those of two others in a report to him first from johann bernoulli , and then from the marquis de l'hôpital , of reported solutions of the problem of the curve of quickest descent , which was publicly proposed by johann bernoulli , geometer — one with a solution of his other problem proposed afterwards by the same person johann published the solution in the journal in may of the following year , and noted that the solution is the same curve as huygens 's tautochrone curve however , his proof is marred by his use of a single constant instead of the three constants , v m , 2g and d , below this story gives some idea of newton 's power , since johann bernoulli took two weeks to solve it '' , and newton had already solved newton 's minimal resistance problem , which is considered the first of the kind in calculus of variations in his paper , jakob bernoulli gave a proof of the condition for least time similar to that below before showing that its solution is a cycloid galileo studied the cycloid and gave it its name , but the connection between it and his problem had to wait for advances in mathematics in a letter to henri basnage , held at the university of basel public library , dated 30 march 1697 , johann bernoulli stated that he had found two methods ( always referred to as '' direct '' and '' indirect '' ) to show that the brachistochrone was the '' common cycloid '' , also called the '' roulette '' following advice from leibniz , he included only the indirect method in the acta eruditorum lipsidae of may 1697 in addition to his indirect method he also published the five other replies to the problem that he received johann bernoulli 's direct method is historically important as it was the first proof that the brachistochrone is the cycloid all the other proofs , including newton 's ( which was not revealed at the time ) are based on finding the gradient at each point he explained that he had not published it in 1697 , for reasons which no longer applied in 1718 according to him , the other solutions simply implied that the time of descent is stationary for the cycloid , but not necessarily the minimum possible
