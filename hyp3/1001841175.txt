however , following revisions to the satellite records , the trends are now similar the ipcc fifth assessment report concluded '' assessment of the large body of studies comparing various long-term radiosonde and msu products since ar4 is hampered by data set version changes , and inherent data uncertainties the urban heat island effect is very small , estimated to account for less than of warming per decade since 1900 3 , observations : atmospheric surface and climate change , section 3.2.2.2 : urban heat islands and land use effects , p surface stations ; results indicate relatively few significant temperature trends , and these are generally evenly divided between warming and cooling trends 95 % of the stations displayed a warming trend after land use/land cover changes took place , and the authors noted '' this does not necessarily imply that the changes are the causative factor a study in 2013 also found that urban bias can be accounted for , and when all available station data is divided into rural and urban , that both temperature sets are broadly consistent national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) maintains the global historical climatology network ( ghcn-monthly ) data base containing historical temperature , precipitation , and pressure data for thousands of land stations worldwide also , noaa 's national climatic data center ( ncdc ) ncdc state of the climate global analysis , april 2010 of surface temperature measurements maintains a global temperature record since 1880
