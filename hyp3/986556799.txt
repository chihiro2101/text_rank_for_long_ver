even before fuller had established a band in his hometown of el paso , he recorded his first single , '' you 're in love '' , under yucca records in 1961 with assistance of the embers , a local band that fuller played in previously after '' you 're in love '' was a regional hit , fuller had his next single , '' gently my love '' professionally recorded at norman petty recording studios this time , the band was credited as the shindigs to capitalize on the new abc show , shindig ! seeking a more permanent name , keane decided upon the bobby fuller four ( as he favored fuller ) , which was first used on the band 's next single , '' take my word '' the new name received mixed reactions with the rest of the group , claiming that it put too much emphasis on fuller , as opposed to the rest of the band , but the name stuck while their next release , '' never to be forgotten '' brought a regional hit , the band 's next single , '' let her dance '' brought the band 's first national hit , barely missing the billboard hot 100 at 133 , though bringing in a top 40 hit with powell reinstated , the group went on to release '' love 's made a fool of you , '' another crickets cover ( written by buddy holly and bob montgomery and recorded by holly as a demo , reportedly intended for the everly brothers , though never recorded by that duo ) this went on to become another national hit for the band the group released a few singles ( including overdubbing the bobby fuller four 's '' it 's love , come what may '' ) , but disbanded less than a year later in 1967 without any chart success
