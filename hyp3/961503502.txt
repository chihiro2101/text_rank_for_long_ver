a relational database schema is defined as a tuple s ( d , r , h ) where d is the domain of atomic values ( see relational model for more on the notions of domain and atomic value ) , r is a finite set of relation names , and : h : r → 2 c a function that associates a header with each relation name in r ) given a domain d we define a tuple over d as a partial function that maps some column names to an atomic value in d the latter requirement simply says that all the tuples in a relation should contain the same column names , namely those defined for it in the schema for the construction of the formulas we will assume an infinite set v of tuple variables the formulas are defined given a database schema s ( d , r , h ) and a partial function type : v ⇸ 2 c , called at type assignment , that assigns headers to some tuple variables
