the mission was originally planned to fly astronaut around the moon , but the failures of and led the soviets to send an uncrewed mission instead , from fear of the negative propaganda of an unsuccessful crewed flight could transmit some of its data back to ground stations , although data stored onboard and collected after return to earth has less noise the maneuver was performed from earth using the sun and the earth as reference points the soviet government had deployed eight ships to the indian ocean prior to the launch , as a precaution in case the spacecraft could not reach soviet territory ; only three of them had rescue helicopters on board became the first spacecraft to circle the moon and return to earth although the atmospheric entry would probably have been lethal for human occupants , it did not appear to affect the biological specimens , which were alive when the descent module was opened four days after landing shadowed the soviet recovery ships , collecting intelligence , but left shortly after the spacecraft was brought on board the soviet ship the british interplanetary society believed that the ussr would be able to send cosmonauts around the moon within a matter of months the mission had been intended to fly closer to the moon , and its actual distance did not allow for useful lunar photography the sources indicated that the spacecraft landed in the indian ocean when the planned location was in soviet territory , which was a factor in the recovery taking ten hours the authors concluded that the changes in the flight tortoises were primarily due to starvation , with the space travel having little effect the soviets made this announcement a month before the planned apollo 8 flight , in an attempt to show they were close to being able to carry out a crewed trip to the moon the cosmonauts were apparently reading out telemetry data and computer readings , and even discussing making an attempt to land at the height of the cold war , there was a real concern that the soviets might actually beat nasa to the moon so i took the mike and said : '' the flight is proceeding according to normal ; we â€™ re approaching the surface
