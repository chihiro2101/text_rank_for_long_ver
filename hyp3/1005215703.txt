an animal chimera is a single organism that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction chimeras can often breed , but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes ; varying degrees of intersex differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male for example , the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes the charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that lydia was a chimera , with the matching dna being found in her cervical tissue another case was that of karen keegan , who was also suspected ( initially ) of not being her children 's biological mother , after dna tests on her adult sons for a kidney transplant she needed , seemed to show she was not their mother mothers often also have a few cells genetically identical to those of their children , and some people also have some cells genetically identical to those of their siblings ( maternal siblings only , since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them ) an individual that falls under this classification possesses two different sets of lineage ( genetic ) : one that was inherited genetically at the time of the formation of the human embryo and the other that was intentionally introduced through a medical procedure known as transplantation specific types of transplants that could induce this condition include bone marrow transplants and organ transplants , as the recipient 's body essentially works to permanently incorporate the new blood stem cells into it apparently this resulted from her twin brother 's cells living in her body a 1996 study found that such blood group chimerism is not rare another report of a human chimera was published in 1998 , where a male human had some partially developed female organs due to chimerism in 2017 , a human-pig chimera was reported to have been created ; the chimera was also reported to have 0.001 % human cells , with the balance being pig in 2019 , the blood and seminal fluid of a man in reno , nevada ( who had undergone a vasectomy ) , exhibited only the genetic content of his bone marrow donor the dna content of semen from an assault case in 2004 matched that of a man who had been in prison at the time of the assault , but who had been a bone marrow donor for his brother , who was later determined to have committed the crime they were created by mixing cells from totipotent four cell blastocysts ; although the cells never fused , they worked together to form organs in august 2003 , researchers at the shanghai second medical university in china reported that they had successfully fused human skin cells and rabbit ova to create the first human chimeric embryos the embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory setting , and then destroyed to harvest the resulting stem cells in 2007 , scientists at the university of nevada school of medicine created a sheep whose blood contained 15 % human cells and 85 % sheep cells on january 22 , 2019 the national society of genetic counselors released an article — chimerism explained : how one person can unknowingly have two sets of dna , where they state “ tetragametic chimerism , where a twin pregnancy evolves into one child , is currently believed to be one of the rarer forms image : chimericmousewithpups.jpg thumb a chimeric mouse with its offspring , which carry the w : agouti gene ; note pink eye chimeric mice are important animals in biological research , as they allow for the investigation of a variety of biological questions in an animal that has two distinct genetic pools within it injection on the other hand was pioneered by richard gardner and ralph brinster who injected cells into blastocysts to create chimeric mice with germ lines fully derived from injected embryonic stem cells ( es cells ) since this discovery occurred in 1988 , es cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus , different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras , since at these stages of development , the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage , and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm it is possible to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other es cells can be used in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper embryos that are to be used in chimeras can be further genetically altered in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera the combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice , since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell if embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera , the following procedure is common : a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse , by way of electroporation ; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance , provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting ; and be able to be positively selected for then , these injected blastocysts are implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse , which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse 's es cells chimera mouse production by blastocyst injection , wellcome trust sanger institute , this same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of es cells and diploid embryos , diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit , to these wells es cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage , and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse the tissues may be partially fused together following grafting to form a single growing organism that preserves both types of tissue in a single shoot
