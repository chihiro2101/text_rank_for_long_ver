'' duck soup – encyclopædia britannica groucho later said of his brother : '' except for the chorus girls , being a straight man in the marx brothers was n't fun for him he wanted to be a comedian ,

judaism blakeley also wrote in her book that zeppo wanted to keep her son out of the picture , adding a room for him onto his estate , which was more of a guest house , as it was separated from the main residence at the last minute , blakeley was told she could not have the film , so zeppo went to the country club and spoke to sinatra , who agreed to let him have an early release of a film he had just finished named come blow your horn sinatra also gave her a house to live in along similar lines , gerald mast , in his book the comic mind : comedy and movies , noted that zeppo 's comedic persona , while certainly more subtle than his brothers ' , was undeniably present : he added a fourth dimension as the cliché of the romantic juvenile , the bland wooden espouser of sentiments that seem to exist only in the world of the sound stage while this interpretation of zeppo 's comedic contributions could seemingly be considered a contemporary reappraisal of his role in the paramount

generally be considered a different comedy team altogether , noting that '' changes in the marx brothers ’ screen personas were immediate and apparent , '' with less of vaudevillian-inspired anarchy and more in tune with standard hollywood comedies where '' love stories were injected in the plots to make their films more palatable to female moviegoers '' bader notes zeppo 's absence as a symptom of his older brothers ' watered-down new act : their zaniness and anarchy would be heavily diluted at m-g-m as the studio found them a wider audience but in the paramount films they certainly are the marx brothers of the stage – the four marx brothers , as minnie intended them to be hoongerdoonger , marx brothers fans know he ’ s the best man for the job of course they were still great as a trio

his friends , charlotte chandler defended zeppo as being '' the marx brothers ' interpreter in the worlds they invaded zeppo 's importance to the marx brothers ' initial success was as a marx brother

once noted that zeppo 's role was '' handsome , obtuse , slightly wooden , '' and that he '' brought logic to a basically illogical story , '' acting as '' an intrusion '' to their otherwise complete anarchy it takes a marx brother to pull something like that on a marx brother and get away with it critic danél griffin , who praises zeppo as '' that great comic parody of the schleppy juvenile role of the 1920s/30s musicals '' , believes that the onscreen dynamic between groucho and zeppo is one of the '' key relationships between the individual marx brothers that shape their comedic strategy ,

that the marxes were never quite as good again after they lost their one straight man zeppo 's inclusion in the family made the others less like clowns and more like brothers how a lost marx brothers
