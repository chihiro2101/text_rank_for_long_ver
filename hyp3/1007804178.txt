middle mongol ( depending on classification spoken from the 13th century until the early 15th century or late 16th century ; given the almost entire lack of written sources for the period in between , an exact cutoff point can not be established ) classical mongolian , from approximately 1700 to 1900 mongolian language the standard mongolian language has been in official use since 1919 , and this form of the language is used in the economic , political , and social fields.the script for standard mongolian uses a version of the russian alphabet called the mongolian cyrillic alphabet it was introduced in the 1940s in the mongolian people 's republic under soviet influence , after a brief period where latin was used as the official script the classification and numbers of speakers above follow janhunen ( 2006 ) except for southern mongolic , which follows nugteren ( 2011 ) proto-mongolic can be clearly identified chronologically with the language spoken by the mongols during genghis khan 's early expansion in the 1200-1210s in the case of early pre-proto-mongolic , certain loanwords in the mongolic languages point to early contact with oghur ( pre-proto-bulgaric ) turkic , also known as r-turkic the chuvash language , spoken by 1 million people in european russia , is the only living representative of oghur turkic which split from proto turkic around the 1st century ad proto-mongolic , the ancestor language of the modern mongolic languages , is very close to middle mongol , the language spoken at the time of genghis khan and the mongol empire most features of modern mongolic languages can thus be reconstructed from middle mongol an exception would be the voice suffix like -caga- 'do together ' , which can be reconstructed from the modern languages but is not attested in middle mongol believed that at least some of their constituent tribes spoke a mongolian language , though there is still some argument that a particular variety of turkic may have been spoken among them juha janhunen ( 2006 ) classified the khitan language into the '' para-mongolic '' family , meaning that it is related to the mongolic languages as a sister group , rather than as a direct descendant of proto-mongolic has also identified several possible loanwords from koreanic languages into the khitan language
