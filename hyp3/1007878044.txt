clock makers were important developers of machine tools including gear and screw cutting machines , and were also involved in the mathematical development of gear designs water powered bellows for blast furnaces , used in china in ancient times , were in use in europe by the 15th century gear cutting machines came into use in the 18th century demand for metal parts used in textile machinery led to the invention of many machine tools in the late 1700s until the mid-1800s in the mid to late 19th century , hydraulic and pneumatic devices were able to power various mechanical actions , such as positioning tools or work pieces power steering for automobiles uses hydraulic mechanisms , as does practically all earth moving equipment and other construction equipment and many attachments to tractors by the early 20th century machines developed the ability to perform more complex operations that had previously been done by skilled craftsmen powered machinery today usually means either by electric motor or internal combustion engine before the first decade of the 20th century powered usually meant by steam engine , water or wind many of the early machines and machine tools were hand powered , but most changed over to water or steam power by the early 19th century electrification allowed individual machines to each be powered by a separate motor in what is called unit drive unit drive allowed factories to be better arranged and allowed different machines to run at different speeds unit drive also allowed much higher speeds , which was especially important for machine tools by the 1920s fully automatic machines , which required much less operator attention , were being used internal combustion engines mostly have an efficiency of about 20 % , ic engine 20 % efficient although large diesel engines , such as those used to power ships , may have efficiencies of nearly 50 % when we compare the costs of using an internal combustion engine to a worker to perform work , we notice that an engine can perform more work at a comparative cost 1 liter of fuel yielding 100 arms for 24 hours , when efficiency is 40 % which is never home documentary by yann arthus bertrand too stating that 1 liter of fuel yields 100 arms for 24 hours ; probably from same calculation in addition , the combined work capability of a human is also much lower than that of a machine
