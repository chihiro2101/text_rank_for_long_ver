the feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males ; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head in contrast to many other loricariid 'plecos ' ( many of which regularly exceed a foot in captivity ) , the bristlenose plecos do not usually exceed six inches in length ; they can thus be kept in relatively small tanks , contributing to their popularity in the aquarium hobby ancistrus species are unusual among vertebrates in possessing an x0 sex-determination system , which is the prevailing method in many lineages of arthropod but is very rare elsewhere in the animal kingdom bristlenoses do not school but hide when not feeding , juveniles however are typically found in brightly lit shallows at the water margin making them susceptible to predation by birds males may clean the inside of the cavity with their suckermouth before allowing the female to approach and inspect the nest females prefer males that are already protecting eggs and may prefer males that are protecting larvae ; it has been suggested that the tentacles may act as a fry mimic to attract females , which would allow males without eggs in their nest to compete with males guarding eggs several clutches in various states of development from eggs to free-swimming larvae can be found in one nest 250px these fish are often kept by aquarists , as they are dutiful algae-eaters and smaller in adult size than the common plecos usually seen in pet shops though typically mottled brown or black-and-grey spotted in color , other species are more exotic & nbsp ; – spots of bright yellow on a dark background being a common pattern historically , commonly available species of ancistrus were ancistrus cirrhosus and ancistrus temminckii ; other species are now available , though exact identification is difficult like other plecos , they benefit from the addition of bogwood , which they will rasp at and use as a hiding place & nbsp ; – in the absence of other plant matter ( sources of fibre ) , wood may be essential to the survival of these fish in the aquarium , as it helps digestion of typically high protein fish food males attract females to a small cave or hollow , then guard eggs after fertilization through hatching ( 4–8 days ) until fry are free swimming ( 4–6 days after hatching ) ; the aquarist need only supply a suitable cave , food , and one of each sex caution should be taken with the spines ( odontodes ) & nbsp ; ; although the risk of personal injury is small with this genus , the hooked nature of the odontodes means that a bristlenose may become trapped in non-natural material such as sponge filters and netting
