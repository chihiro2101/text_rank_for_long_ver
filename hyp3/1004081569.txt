from about 1901 , however , mahler 's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life mahler arrived at maiernigg in june 1906 with the draft manuscript of his seventh symphony ; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike 102 mahler 's recollection , however , is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit , and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his eighth symphony two notes in mahler 's handwriting dating from june 1906 show that early schemes for the work , which he may not at first have intended as a fully choral symphony , were based on a four-movement structure in which two '' hymns '' surround an instrumental core 889 these outlines show that mahler had fixed on the idea of opening with the latin hymn , but had not yet settled on the precise form of the rest he soon replaced the last three movements with a single section , essentially a dramatic cantata , based on the closing scenes of goethe 's faust , the depiction of an ideal of redemption through eternal womanhood ( das ewige-weibliche ) when it did , according to alma mahler , '' the complete text fitted the music exactly 523–525 with its use of vocal elements throughout , rather than in episodes at or near the end , the work was the first completely choral symphony to be written 206–207 his youthful assistant otto klemperer remarked later on the many small changes that mahler made to the score during rehearsal : '' he always wanted more clarity , more sound , more dynamic contrast this vast hall had a capacity of 3,200 ; to assist ticket sales and raise publicity , gutmann devised the nickname '' symphony of a thousand '' , which has remained the symphony 's popular subtitle despite mahler 's disapproval also in the audience was the 28-year-old british conductor leopold stokowski , who six years later would lead the first united states performance of the symphony back at his hotel mahler received a letter from thomas mann , which referred to the composer as '' the man who , as i believe , expresses the art of our time in its profoundest and most sacred form '' 913 and 918 this performance was the last time that mahler conducted a premiere of one of his own works on the day following the munich premiere mahler led the orchestra and choruses in a repeat performance during the next three years , according to the calculations of mahler 's friend guido adler the eighth symphony received a further 20 performances across europe the occasion was a great success ; the symphony was played several more times in philadelphia before the orchestra and choruses travelled to new york , for a series of equally well-received performances at the metropolitan opera house 241 the music critic samuel langford , who attended the occasion , commented that '' we do not leave amsterdam greatly envying the diet of mahler first and every other composer afterward , to which mengelberg is training the music-lovers of that city '' the austrian music historian oscar bie , while impressed with the festival as a whole , wrote subsequently that the eighth was '' stronger in effect than in significance , and purer in its voices than in emotion '' the work was played again eight years later by the same forces ; among those present in the audience was the youthful composer benjamin britten to cooke , mahler 's is '' the choral symphony of the twentieth century : like beethoven 's , but in a different way , it sets before us an ideal of redemption which we are as yet far from realising—even perhaps moving away from—but which we can hardly abandon without perishing '' 93–95 in the late 20th century and into the 21st , the symphony was performed in all parts of the world the popularity of the work , and its heroic scale , meant that it was often used as a set piece on celebratory occasions ; on 15 & nbsp ; march 2008 , yoav talmi led 200 instrumentalists and a choir of 800 in a performance in quebec city , to mark the 400th anniversary of the city 's foundation in particular , the first notes of the veni creator theme — : e → b → a : \new staff \with la grange draws attention to the notably high tessitura for the sopranos , for soloists and for choral singers the international gustav mahler society , founded in 1955 , has as its main objective the production of a complete critical edition of all of mahler 's works since stokowski 's version , at least 70 recordings of the symphony have been made by many of the world 's leading orchestras and singers , mostly during live performances
