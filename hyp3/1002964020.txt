also in ex- situ conservation , all of which house whole , protected specimens for breeding and reintroduction into the wild when necessary and possible technical limitations prevent the cryopreservation of many species , but cryobiology is a field of active research , and many studies concerning plants are underway it is important to manage captive populations in a way that minimizes these issues so that the individuals to be introduced will resemble the original founders as closely as possible , which will increase the chances of successful reintroductions the target population size is the number of individuals that are required to maintain appropriate levels of genetic diversity , which is generally considered to by 90 % of the current genetic diversity after 100 years managing populations based on minimizing mean kinship values is often an effective way to increase genetic diversity and to avoid inbreeding within captive populations genetic diversity is often lost within captive populations due to the founder effect and subsequent small population sizes minimizing the loss of genetic diversity within the captive population is an important component of ex situ conservation and is critical for successful reintroductions and the long term success of the species , since more diverse populations have higher adaptive potential the loss of genetic diversity due to the founder effect can be minimized by ensuring that the founder population is large enough and genetically representative of the wild population this is often difficult because removing large numbers of individuals from the wild populations may further reduce the genetic diversity of a species that is already of conservation concern minimizing the number of generations in captivity is another effective method for reducing the loss of genetic diversity in captive populations minimizing selection on captive populations by creating an environment that is similar to their natural environment is another method of reducing adaptations to captivity , but it is important to find a balance between an environment that minimizes adaptation to captivity and an environment that permits adequate reproduction genetic disorders are often an issue within captive populations due to the fact that the populations are usually established from a small number of founders if the genetic disorder is dominant , it may be possible to eliminate the disease completely in a single generation by avoiding breeding of the affected individuals in the process of eliminating genetic disorders , it is important to consider that when certain individuals are prevented from breeding , alleles and therefore genetic diversity are removed from the population ; if these alleles are n't present in other individuals , they may be lost completely preventing certain individuals from the breeding also reduces the effective population size , which is associated with problems such as the loss of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding it is to be used as a last resort , or as a supplement to in situ conservation because it can not recreate the habitat as a whole : the entire genetic variation of a species , its symbiosis counterparts , or those elements which , over time , might help a species adapt to its changing surroundings instead , ex situ conservation removes the species from its natural ecological contexts , preserving it under semi-isolated conditions whereby natural evolution and adaptation processes are either temporarily halted or altered by introducing the specimen to an unnatural habitat the downside to this is that , when re-released , the species may lack the genetic adaptations and mutations which would allow it to thrive in its ever-changing natural habitat these factors , combined with the specific environmental needs of many species , some of which are nearly impossible to recreate by man , make ex situ conservation impossible for a great number of the world 's endangered flora and fauna
