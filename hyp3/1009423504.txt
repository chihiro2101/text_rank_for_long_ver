most laestadians in finland are part of the national lutheran church of finland , but in america , where there is no official lutheran church , they founded their own denomination , which split into several sub-groups in the mid-20th century the three large main branches are conservative laestadianism ( corresponds to the laestadian lutheran church , in north america known to other laestadians as the '' heidemans '' after 20th-century leader paul a in finland , the elämän sana ( '' the word of life '' ) group , as the most '' mainline '' of the different branches of laestadianism , has been prominent within the hierarchy of the evangelical lutheran church of finland : two members have been elected bishops of oulu , and one has served as military bishop ( head chaplain of the finnish defence forces and the equivalent of a major general ) all branches share many essential teachings including a central emphasis on the lutheran doctrine of justification ( forgiveness and grace ) another core teaching concerns essential differences in lifestyle and beliefs between true believers on one hand , and false christians ( sometimes distinguished as living faith versus dead faith ) and unbelievers on the other the leaders of the two largest laestadian sub-groups , the conservative laestadians and firstborn laestadians , have for decades excluded each other and all other laestadian sub-groups from the kingdom of heaven even though the denominations ' core doctrines are nearly indistinguishable the leadership of the smaller third main sub-group , the federation , has continued to regard the other sub-groups as of living faith , after having unsuccessfully sought to preserve unity within laestadianism when its larger counterparts ' leaders in the 1930s called for , and later required , dissociation from the federation and other laestadian denominations thus it is a common practice among laestadians in or out of church at any time , but especially during the church service prior to the rite of holy communion , to be confessing their sins to one another or , occasionally , to one of the church ministers performing the sacrament '' this procedure , ingrained in laestadianism , differs from absolution lutheran church in several aspects , including that the request for forgiveness need not be , and most often is not , to the minister ; the confession is often made openly ; confession is not by appointment but rather readily available to any believer from any other believer at any time ; and the specific wording of the declaration states that the means of atonement is christ 's shed blood because a laestadian takes very seriously the proposition that grace exists only for one whose sins have been specifically forgiven , there is scarcely another rite in this movement that would rival the importance of the declaration of forgiveness to take their leave of each other , they say '' god 's peace '' in english ( or in finnish : '' jumalan rauhaa '' ) some conservative elements within the church go even further in rejecting the ways of the world , for examples , refusing to buy insurance , prohibiting their children 's participation in organized school sports , and removing their car radios especially large numbers of firstborn apostolic lutherans and many members of the most conservative congregations within the word of peace group , for examples , do not use birth control because they believe that a child is a gift from god ;
