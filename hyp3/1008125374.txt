medicine hearnshaw , ( 1979 ) , p2 the younger cyril burt 's education began in london at a board school near st james 's park the visits the burts made to the galton estate not only allowed the young burt to learn about the work of francis galton , but also allowed burt to meet him on multiple occasions and to be strongly drawn to his ideas ; especially his studies in statistics and individual differences , two defining characters of the london school of psychology whose membership includes both galton and burt he attended king 's ( now known as warwick ) school , in the county town , from 1892 to 1895 , and later won a scholarship to christ 's hospital , then located in london , where he developed his interest in psychology from 1902 , he attended jesus college , oxford , where he studied classics and took an interest in philosophy and psychology , the latter under william mcdougall mcdougall , knowing burt 's interest in galton 's work , taught him the elements of psychometrics , thus helping burt with his first steps in the development and structure of mental tests , an interest that would last the rest of his life burt was one of a group of students who worked with mcdougall , which included william brown , john flügel , and may smith , who all went on to have distinguished careers in psychology in 1907 , mcdougall invited burt to help with a nationwide survey of physical and mental characteristics of the british people , proposed by francis galton , in which he was to work on the standardization of psychological tests he notably established that girls were equal to boys in general intelligence the post also allowed him to work in spearman 's laboratory , and receive research assistants from the national institute of industrial psychology , including winifred raphael burt was much involved in the initiation of child guidance in great britain and his 1925 publication the young delinquent led to opening of the london child guidance clinic in islington in 1927 in 1924 burt was also appointed part-time professor of educational psychology at the london day training college ( ldtc ) , and carried out much of his child guidance work on the premises in 1931 burt resigned his position at the lcc and the ldtc after he was appointed professor and chair of psychology at university college london , taking over the position from charles spearman , thus ending his almost 20-year career as a school psychological practitioner one of his students , reuben conrad , recalled that he once arrived at the university with a chimpanzee that he had borrowed from london zoo , though conrad could not recall what point burt was trying to make bishop , july 2016 the psychologist vol.29 ( pp.578–579 ) while at london , burt influenced many students , including raymond cattell and hans eysenck , and toward the end of his life , arthur jensen and chris brand despite his lasting reputation as a statistical psychologist cyril burt was also involved in psychoanalysis in 1946 he became the first british psychologist to be knighted for his contributions to psychological testing and for making educational opportunities more widely available , according to an account by j burt was a member of the london school of differential psychology , and of the british eugenics society burt retired in 1951 at the age of 68 , but continued writing articles and books shortly after burt died it became known that all of his notes and records had been burnt , and he was accused of falsifying research data leslie hearnshaw , a close friend of burt and his official biographer , concluded after examining the criticisms that most of burt 's data from after world war ii were unreliable or fraudulent tucker argued in a 1997 article that : '' a comparison of his twin sample with that from other well documented studies , however , leaves little doubt that he committed fraud philippe rushton , themselves involved in controversy for their views on race , see , for example : francisco gil-white , resurrecting racism , chapter 10 douglas wahlsten ( 2001 ) book review of race , evolution and behavior have claimed that the contentious correlations reported by burt are in line with the correlations found in other twin studies '' burt 's statistical sophistication was , however , called into question by his student charlotte banks , who in a foreword to burt 's last book , published posthumously , wrote that he combined samples gathered from schoolchildren in different earlier years in his later papers without comment gillie 's 1976 article in the sunday times , reprinted in the phi delta kappan in 1977 , summarised attempts to trace two of burt 's supposed collaborators , margaret howard and j publications attributed to these two were published in a journal edited by burt between 1952 and 1959 , including a joint paper of burt and howard , burt , c remarkable as one of the few , if not the only , research paper not authored solely by burt the papers in the names of howard or conway were published after burt 's retirement from university college although their affiliations were said to be with university college , howard 's specifically with its psychology department no-one with these names was registered as a member of staff or student at university college between 1914 and 1976 , or in any other institution within the university of london , and its psychology department could not trace either of them however , he does not address the central issue , that burt wrote scientific papers and published them as editor of a journal under false names and without the consent of the supposed authors in response to articles by fletcher , claiming that his biography of burt and attacks by others were motivated by ideological or political malice , hernshaw added to gillie 's claims by stating that burt 's detailed records of visitors contained no records of visits by howard or conway in the years they were supposed to have collaborated with him on collecting and testing 32 pairs of separated monozygotic twins , that his papers contained no correspondence with or written material from them , and that no one close to burt had met them in his 1991 book , fletcher questioned gillie 's claim of the lack of independent articles published by howard or conway in scientific journals other than the journal of statistical psychology edited by burt , claiming howard was also said to be mentioned in the membership list of the british psychological society , prof other writers have suggested that howard and conway may have existed , but that burt had simply used their names to support his research , as he had been shown to have done with another named so-called researcher however joynson accepted that burt frequently used assumed names to publish ( in the journal burt edited , the journal of statistical psychology ) papers that burt had written himself : the names he used included those of howard and conway burt 's defenders have claimed that everyone knew that , after his retirement , burt 's data was flawed and that he published articles under pseudonyms ,
