in an excited state , one or more of the protons or neutrons in a nucleus occupy a nuclear orbital of higher energy than an available nuclear orbital however , a much stronger type of binding energy , the nuclear binding energy , is involved in nuclear processes due to this , most nuclear excited states decay by gamma ray emission for example , a well-known nuclear isomer used in various medical procedures is , which decays with a half-life of about 6 hours by emitting a gamma ray of 140 & nbsp ; kev of energy ; this is close to the energy of medical diagnostic x-rays nuclear isomers have long half-lives because their gamma decay is '' forbidden '' from the large change in nuclear spin needed to emit a gamma ray during internal conversion , energy of nuclear de-excitation is not emitted as a gamma ray , but is instead used to accelerate one of the inner electrons of the atom in nuclei that are far from stability in energy , even more decay modes are known a nucleus produced this way generally starts its existence in an excited state that relaxes through the emission of one or more gamma rays or conversion electrons this geometry can result in quantum-mechanical states where the distribution of protons and neutrons is so much further from spherical geometry that de-excitation to the nuclear ground state is strongly hindered as a result , the characterization '' nuclear isomer '' is usually applied only to configurations with half-lives of 10 −9 & nbsp ; seconds or longer this way of de-excitation had never been observed ; however , the de-excitation of by resonant photo-excitation of intermediate high levels of this nucleus ( e & nbsp ; ~ & nbsp ; 1 & nbsp ; mev ) was found in 1999 by belic and co-workers in the stuttgart nuclear physics group due to its low energy , the isomer is expected to allow for direct nuclear laser spectroscopy and the development of a nuclear clock of unprecedented accuracy the most common mechanism for suppression of gamma decay of excited nuclei , and thus the existence of a metastable isomer , is lack of a decay route for the excited state that will change nuclear angular momentum along any given direction by the most common amount of 1 quantum unit ħ in the spin angular momentum each additional unit of spin change larger than 1 that the emitted gamma ray must carry inhibits decay rate by about 5 orders of magnitude nuclear isomers could replace other isotopes , and with further development , it may be possible to turn them on and off by triggering decay as needed an isotope such as 177 lu releases gamma rays by decay through a series of internal energy levels within the nucleus , and it is thought that by learning the triggering cross sections with sufficient accuracy , it may be possible to create energy stores that are 10 6 times more concentrated than high explosive or other traditional chemical energy storage the actual process has two types ( modes ) : gamma ray emission ( emission of a high-energy photon ) , internal conversion ( the energy is used to eject one of the atom 's electrons ) the emission of a gamma ray from an excited nuclear state allows the nucleus to lose energy and reach a lower-energy state , sometimes its ground state the process of isomeric transition is similar to gamma emission from any excited nuclear state , but differs by involving excited metastable states of nuclei with longer half-lives this should not be confused with the internal conversion process , in which no gamma-ray photon is produced as an intermediate particle
