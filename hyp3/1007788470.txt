letters from the city mari dated at the latest from the 18th century showed that these divinatory practices were not limited to the royal court , but also played an important role in everyday life of the people omens represented the divine will and the decisions of the gods , their positioning opposite human endeavors , and were aimed at being understood by sensitive receivers of the time , who brought the divine charisma to become intermediaries , channels between the world of gods and humans even since homeric times , the greeks paid special attention to these signs : when they saw vultures from the left , another symbol of zeus , they considered it a bad omen in the greek territory , seers also judged good and bad omens from the unwillingness or willingness of a victim to approach the altar and by the state of its offal when slaughtered in ancient roman religion , augurs interpreted the flights of birds to ascertain the will of the gods , in response to specific questions their system was complex ; for example , while a bird-sign on the left was usually favourable ( auspicious ) and one on the right unfavourable ( inauspicious ) , the combination of a raven on the right and a crow on the left was favourable certain natural events , particularly lightning strikes and thunder , could be ominous for the public or state , or only for the individual who saw or heard them many romans believed that particular words , phrases or incidents might carry prophetic content aimed at particular individuals who witnessed or heard them such '' private '' omens could be accepted , and their benefits secured ( or their threat averted ) by use of countersigns , or verbal formulas such as accepit omen , arripuit omen ( '' i accept the omen , i hold to it '' ) ; the consul l aemilius paullus , when about to embark on his campaign against king perseus , heard his daughter say that her dog persa had died ; given the similarity of the names and the death of the dog , he took this as a sign that perseus would be defeated - which he was omens may be considered either good or bad depending on their interpretation the same sign may be interpreted differently by different people or different cultures for example , a superstition in the united states and other countries across europe indicates that a black cat is an omen of bad luck
