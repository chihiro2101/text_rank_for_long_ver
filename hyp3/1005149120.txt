these are considered the first transformers most characters ' numbers hardly ever dipped below 8 , the go-bot version of optimus prime was the first character to have all values at 10 , a trend that would repeat for most '' leader '' characters the first transformers toys were created from two different transforming robot toy lines from takara , the car-robots and micro change , from the diaclone and microman series , respectively it is thought that hasbro europe as it now stands did not come into existence till 1985 , hence no records of transformers sales in 1984 in 1986 the transformers animated movie had been released , and during the run of the movie , through a pamphlet that came with certain figures , you could order certain transformers through the mail , such as optimus prime among other toys the 1986 line featured another significant change in that many , if not the majority , of the toys were conceived as futuristic vehicles and bore little resemblance to present-day machinery many have speculated that this change might have been what signaled the beginning of the end for the transformers , as part of the novelty of the first lines was the realistic vehicles that turned into robots powermasters , including the new version of fan favorite optimus prime , came with partners that transformed into engines also during this time , micromasters were introduced , and would become one of the last sub-groups of generation one micromasters were tiny transformers created to compete with the micro machines , a hugely popular toy line of the time for the first time , the transformers received a new design for their title logo while transformers ended poorly for the us market , the same can not be said for the uk , canada , and japan markets as they went on to produce their own continuing series between 1991 and 1993 , despite the uk market in particular missing a substantial amount of figures prominent in the comics and animated series throughout the line 's run the term generation 1 is a retronym ; the series was simply known as '' transformers '' until the release of the generation 2 series new characters are still occasionally added to the line , primarily by e-hobby ) large-scale production of new characters in this line ended with the onset of generation 2 the subgroups concept was done away with for the first year , but there were no new molds or characters four unreleased molds were released in the machine wars line , and four more resurfaced in the robots in disguise series while there had been transformers that change into robotic animals , the premise of the new line was that all figures would transform into animals with realistic appearances the beast wars toy line was launched in the autumn of 1995 , and mainframe entertainment produced a computer-generated imagery , or cgi , animated series program to tie in with the new toy line hasbro also wanted the '' mutant heads '' found on all of the deluxe sized first year toys as battle helmets , but mainframe scrapped the idea as it would have required three animation models for each character instead of two the beast wars line was also the first appearance of '' flip changer '' basics , where flipping a part of the animal mode ( usually the head or tail ) would transform the entire toy , and moving the part back would transform the toy back to beast mode long-time transformers fans noticed the prominence of the words '' beast wars '' over '' transformers '' , the latter appearing in small type under the former the transformers ' fan base splintered into two groups as a direct result , with the one enjoying beast wars for what it was and the other refusing to accept it as official canon in the transformers mythology like beast wars , the name transformers was used only as a secondary title while beast machines was still running in canada , japan 's takara made a bid to return to the familiar vehicle-transforming robots concept this line was brought by hasbro to america as the robots in disguise series , and featured the autobots facing off against the predacons this series is usually regarded by most as filler while hasbro contemplated the next direction for transformers however most fans of transformers recognise that most if not all of the toys released from this line were of excellent quality ( with the optimus prime and ultra magnus figures gaining considerable praise ) , combining the ball-joint articulation with detailed , well painted alternate modes robots in disguise was responsible for introducing a lot of concepts that would be re-used often in the next incarnations of transformers also of note , megatron 's toy was repainted and re-released ( retooled to allow 4 new altmodes ) under the name galvatron , beginning a tradition of repaints that would follow through with armada and subsequent toy lines after several lines of toys produced by one company or the other , hasbro and takara united to produce what was purported to be a single , identical line of transformers for release worldwide in tandem with this new endeavor , armada signaled a new continuity in its accompanying animated series and a new focus in both the show and the toys on mini-cons , a new faction of transformers other items of note in the armada line : the armada line featured the first commercially available figure of unicron , who is a legendary character from generation 1 , and the main villain of the transformers : the movie this line was revitalized in 2008 with new molds and the introduction of various sub-series from previous popular transformers lines like classics the accompanying television series program was a direct continuation of the events of transformers : armada and featured many of the same characters in new forms this was reflected in the toy line , as characters such as hot shot , jetfire , optimus prime and megatron were all released with entirely new molds transformers : energon introduced several new concepts to the toy line many autobot figures in the line were able to combine with a partner to form a larger robot through the '' powerlinx '' process while no longer the focus of the line , there were several mini-con releases in energon as well each figure came with a cyber key regardless of size , but there were several cyber keys crucial to the plot of the anime series which only came with certain figures again , many of the same characters were included but with entirely new figures from new molds many of the repaints taken from the armada line had remolded parts retro-fitted to the original designs so their mini-con features would now use a planet key instead previous examples were the japanese series programs masterforce and car robots similarly , fans found preliminary artwork of multiple characters , although it was not known at the time how close these were to the final designs alongside that , they gave them more alien features that probably was n't mentioned in the comics or t.v even though the transformers were heavily modified for the film for a more alien '' feel '' , they still kept some key features from the g1 look to stay true to the character 's origins also , as a new feature , most figures include advanced '' automorph technology '' , which is designed to create quicker and easier conversion , which means moving one part of the vehicle or robot causes other parts to move , creating a final shift to battle mode ; this was successful because the transformation was more complex in the movie line than in any other transformers toy line this new series uses a very different art-style from the previous series the line was released alongside a sub-series of the transformers : universe line for its legends size figures this line features robot versions of various star wars characters this is a new line which features robot versions of various marvel comics superheroes ( and later more of the star wars transformers figures once it merged with this line ) eventually , the star wars transformers figure joined the line with reissues of previous figures , as well as all new molds a japanese exclusive , this is a new line of transformers toys shaped from disney characters that were first introduced in 2009
