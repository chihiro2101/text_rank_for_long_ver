once a year , the father 's workplace allowed their employees family to visit , which included allowing them to use the facility 's mainframe system to play games toy took interest in the text-based star trek game ( 1971 ) , which represented space combat through characters on screen , and required players to make strategic decisions each turn toy took to learn programming and recreate this game on other computer systems that he could access , including the processor technology sol-20 and the atari 400 adventure , considered the first text-based adventure game , challenged the player to explore a cave system through descriptions given by the computer and commands issued by the player wichman chose ucsc specifically to study on game design as to become a board game developer , and this led him into the computer sciences to get the opportunity to play and develop games after crafting a few games using curses to learn the library , they came up with the idea of an adventure game in the flavor of dungeons & dragons but to address their concerns with the static nature of adventure games , wanted to include elements that would change every time the game was played wichman came up with the name rogue , based on the idea that unlike the party-based systems of dungeons & dragons , the player 's character was going at this alone they also wanted to make sure the name was short to make it simple to type out on command lines wichman learned the language from toy as they went along while providing significant input on the design of game the first two major aspects of the game developed was the method of displaying the dungeon on screen to the player , and how to generate the dungeon in a random manner once they could have their character move about these randomly created dungeons , they then added equipment , magic items , and monsters with magic items , they wanted the effects of these items to be a mystery on each run through , and thus would initially present the items to the player only by a descriptor such as by color , and only later in the game give the true name of the item once the player experimented or used another means to identify the item for monsters , they wanted to have more advanced intelligence routines as the player got to deeper depths of the dungeons , but had started running into memory limits on the vax-11 , and simply made the monsters stronger with more health to pose more of a challenge toy wanted to move away from the notion of simply learning the right sequence of steps to complete within adventure games , and instead make the player focus on finding the right moves to avoid the character 's death at that moment ; wichman later called this idea '' consequence persistence '' initially , a rogue game had to be completed in one sitting , but by demand of playtesters , toy and wichman added the ability to save the state of the game , so that players could continue a game across sessions after the two got to know each other , toy allowed him access to rogues source code among its fans included unix 's co-developer ken thompson working at bell labs ; dennis ritchie had joked at the time that rogue was '' the biggest waste of cpu cycles in history '' rogues distribution in 4.2 bsd did not include its source code , so after toy and arnold separately left ucb , they took the code with them , making it difficult for anyone to build off it lane took advantage of the more graphical code page 437 character set on pc to expand the number of symbols to represent the dungeon , such as using a happy-face â˜º for the player-character they also took steps to avoid potential copyright issues with tsr , the company that owned dungeons & dragons at that time , by changing the names of monsters like kobolds that were unique to that game toy and lane initially funded the publishing , distribution , and promotion of the ibm pc version themselves , and though they continued to gain sales , they were only able to break even as they lacked the power of a larger distributor both toy and lane recognized that they could implement improved graphics with the macintosh version , but neither had art skills to make the icons borch recognized the difficulty in marketing rogue through traditional methods compared to other games on the market at that time , and opted to push the title through software catalogs rather than retail channels besides the competition from more graphically-interesting games , wichman attributed the failure to the fact that the commercial version of rogue was essentially the same game previously offered for free via bsd and did not pose a new challenge however , as neither toy , wichman , nor arnold released the source code of the game , these efforts generally required the programmers to craft the core game elements from scratch to mimic rogue
