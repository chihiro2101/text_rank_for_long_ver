the development of multi-channel audio systems and later laserdisc in the 1980s created a new paradigm for home video , as it enabled movie enthusiasts to add better sound and images to their setup beginning in the late 1990s , and continuing throughout much of the 2000s , home-theater technology progressed with the development of the dvd-video format ( higher resolution than vhs ) , dolby digital 5.1-channel audio ( '' surround sound '' ) speaker systems , and high-definition television ( hdtv ) , which initially included bulky , heavy cathode ray tube hdtvs and flat screen tvs in the 2010s , the term '' home cinema '' encompasses a range of systems meant for movie playback at home the most basic and economical system could be a dvd player , a standard definition ( sd ) large-screen television with at least a 27-inch ( 69 & nbsp ; cm ) diagonal screen size , and an inexpensive '' home theater in a box '' surround sound amplifier/speaker system with a subwoofer a more expensive home cinema set-up might include a blu-ray disc player , home theater pc ( htpc ) computer or digital media receiver streaming devices with a 10-foot user interface , a high-definition video projector and projection screen with over diagonal screen size ( or a large flatscreen hdtv ) , and a several-hundred-watt home theater receiver with five to eleven surround-sound speakers plus one or two powerful subwoofers home cinema designs and layouts are a personal choice and the type of home cinema a user can set up depends on her/his budget and the space which is available within the home the minimum set of requirements for a home theater are : a large television set or good quality video projector crt ( no new models sold in u.s the most-expensive home cinema set-ups , which can cost over 100,000 us , and which are in the homes of executives , celebrity and high-earning professionals , have expensive , large , high-resolution digital projectors and projection screens , and maybe even custom-built screening rooms which include cinema-style chairs and audiophile-grade sound equipment designed to mimic ( or sometimes even exceed ) commercial cinema performance to do so , many home cinema buffs purchase higher quality components than used for everyday television viewing on a relatively small tv with only built-in speakers a typical home cinema includes the following components : movie or other viewing content : as the name implies , one of the key reasons for setting up a home cinema is to watch movies on a large screen , which does a more effective job at reproducing filmed images of vast landscapes or epic battle sequences many 2016-era dvd players and blu-ray players also have inputs which allow users to view digital photos and other content on the big screen high resolution movie media formats such as blu-ray discs are normally preferred , though dvd or video game console systems are also used some home theaters include a home theater pc with a media center software application to act as the main library for video and music content using a 10-foot user interface and remote control home cinema users may also use a video projector and a movie screen these more advanced installations often include sophisticated acoustic design elements , including '' room-in-a-room '' construction that isolates sound and provides an improved listening environment and a large screen , often using a high definition projector as of 2016 , the days of the 100,000 and over home cinema system is being usurped by the rapid advances in digital audio and video technologies , which has spurred a rapid drop in prices , making a home cinema set-up more affordable than ever before depending on the space available , it may simply be a temporary version with foldable screen , a video projector and couple of speakers , or a permanent fixture with a huge screen and dedicated audio set-up mounted in a weather-proof cabinet projected with a small , portable movie projector onto a portable screen , often without sound , this system became the first practical home theater the rise of home video in the late 1970s almost completely killed the consumer market for 8 & nbsp ; mm film cameras and projectors , as vcrs connected to ordinary televisions provided a simpler and more flexible substitute over the course of three days , retailers , manufacturers , and members of the consumer electronics press were exposed to the first '' home-like '' experience of combining a high-quality video source with multi-channel surround sound in the 2000s , developments such as high-definition video , blu-ray disc ( as well as the now-obsolete hd dvd format , which lost the format war to blu-ray ) and newer high-definition 3d display technologies enabled people to enjoy a cinematic feeling in their own home at a more-affordable price as a result of continuing price reductions , large ( up to 80 ) tvs became a financially competitive alternative to video projectors in living room or even smaller dedicated room setups technologies such as local dimming and the like improved the black levels of lcd screens making them more suitable for use in a dark room however , as of 2020 , video projectors remained the only viable option when screen sizes much over 80 are needed for one user with a modest budget , '' good quality '' may mean a mainstream consumer electronics brand ; for a well-to-do user , a christie projector may be their interpretation of '' good quality '' ( christie units are widely used in professional , commercial theatres )
