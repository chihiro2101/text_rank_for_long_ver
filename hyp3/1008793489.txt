and i should have only done one he talked about the character not so much as 'hannibal lecter the cannibal psychiatrist ' , but as satan – this fallen angel who 's enamoured with mankind and had an affinity for who we are as people , but was definitely not among us – he was other i thought that was a really cool , interesting approach , because i love science fiction and horror and – not that we 'd ever do anything deliberately to suggest this – but having it subtextually play as him being lucifer felt like a really interesting kink to the series lecter and graham also become father figures to abigail , and cover for her when they discover that she was her father 's unwilling accomplice to this end , lecter prevents graham from learning that he has advanced encephalitis , just to see how graham would function under the circumstances in the first-season finale , lecter reluctantly frames graham for a series of murders that he himself committed throughout the season – including ,

to free lecter , and dolarhyde attacks the convoy , killing the guards and letting lecter and graham live series creator bryan fuller has said this scene is meant to suggest that lecter and graham survived and that graham has become lecter 's partner in murder because all of these characters , and particularly bedelia , was able to call out what she had witnessed between lecter and graham , it seemed like a natural conclusion i remember when i turned in the rewrite pages where will asks bedelia if hannibal is in love with him , i got a note from don mancini , one of our writers who was always pushing for more homosexual text – not just context or subtext but text , text , text – and he was like , '' i 'm so glad you put that in there ! they said it ! they said it ! '' discussing what motivated him to verbally acknowledge the romance between graham and lecter , fuller said , '' it felt like we had to shit or get off the pot , ultimately , because there had been so much going on between these two men that when will asks , '' is hannibal lecter in love with me ? '' it is very much about death and the romance between these two men but it 's a love relationship between two men : one of them is a cannibal , and one of them understands those cannibalistic instincts all too well
