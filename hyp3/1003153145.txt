the second and current albert bridge was built in 1895 in designing the bridge as two long spans with one central pier , he tried to minimise the obstruction to flood waters created by multiple piers , which had been the downfall of the first bridge a scottish coal strike held up delivery of the rolled steel for eight months , and removal of the river bedrock for the central pier alone took four months the shore end rested on two trolleys , and when the tide was at its highest , specially constructed staging on an old barque took the weight of the other end of the truss from temporary piles when opened the bridge also catered for pedestrian traffic , until the construction of the nearby walter taylor bridge in 1937 the albert bridge remains one of australia 's largest truss bridges at the time of its completion , as a metal truss bridge it was second only to the first hawkesbury rail bridge ( 1889 ) in span length the albert bridge is still australia 's third longest span metal truss bridge , after brisbane 's story bridge ( 1940 ) ( story bridge ) and the second hawkesbury rail bridge ( 1945 ) albert bridge at indooroopilly is significant as an early , large span metal truss bridge in australia , and remains the country 's third longest span metal truss bridge at the time of construction , albert bridge was the largest bridge in australia to be manufactured locally albert bridge is significant for its contribution to the railway system linking the capital with southern and western queensland , remaining for over six decades part of the only railway link across the brisbane river the bridge is highly intact , and provides important physical evidence of late 19th century railway bridge design and construction in australia the bridge is important also for its landmark quality and aesthetic contribution to the riverscape along the indooroopilly reach of the brisbane river
