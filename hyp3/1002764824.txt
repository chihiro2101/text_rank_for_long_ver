the palearctic realm includes mostly subarctic climate and temperate climate ecoregions , which run across eurasia from western europe to the bering sea this vast euro-siberian region is characterized by many shared plant and animal species , and has many affinities with the temperate and boreal regions of the nearctic realm of north america eurasia and north america were often connected by the bering land bridge , and have very similar mammal and bird fauna , with many eurasian species having moved into north america , and fewer north american species having moved into eurasia the lands bordering the mediterranean sea in southern europe , north africa , and western asia are home to the mediterranean basin ecoregions , which together constitute the world 's largest and most diverse mediterranean climate region of the world , with generally mild , rainy winters and hot , dry summers the mediterranean basin is also one of the world 's most endangered biogeographic regions ; only 4 % of the region 's original vegetation remains , and human activities , including overgrazing , deforestation , and conversion of lands for pasture , agriculture , and urbanization , have degraded much of the region china , korea and japan are more humid and temperate than adjacent siberia and central asia , and are home to rich temperate coniferous , broadleaf , and mixed forests , which are now mostly limited to mountainous areas , as the densely populated lowlands and river basins have been converted to intensive agricultural and urban use in the subtropical region of southern china and southern edge of the himalayas , the palearctic temperate forests transition to the subtropical and tropical forests of indomalaya , creating a rich and diverse mix of plant and animal species in southeastern asia , high mountain ranges form tongues of palearctic flora and fauna in northern indochina and southern china the realm contains several important freshwater ecoregions as well , including the heavily developed rivers of europe , the rivers of russia , which flow into the arctic , baltic , black , and caspian seas , siberia 's lake baikal , the oldest and deepest lake on the planet , and japan 's ancient lake biwa
