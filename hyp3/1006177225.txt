in the 5th century ad , the tribes of north arabia became a major threat to the trade line between yemen and syria the ḥimyarites of sheba decided to establish a vassal state that controlled central and north arabia the kindah established a kingdom in najd in central arabia unlike the organized states of yemen ; its kings exercised an influence over a number of associated tribes more by personal prestige than by coercive settled authority in the 5th and 6th centuries ad , the kindites made the first real concerted effort to unite all the tribes of central arabia through alliances , and focused on wars with the lakhmids al-ḥārith ibn 'amr , the most famous of their kings , finally succeeded in capturing the lakhmid capital of al-ḥirah in southern modern-day iraq later however in about 529 , al-mundhir recaptured the city and put king ḥārith and about fifty members of his family to death within three years the kindite kingdom had split into four groups : asad , taghlib , qays and kinānah , each led by a prince of kindah the most authentic opinion according to '' saifur rahman al mubararakpuri '' , however , is that dhat ar-riqa ‘ campaign took place after the fall of khaibar ( and not as part of the invasion of nejd ) other arabic tribes also wished to revert to exit from islam to local leadership and split from medina 's control donner , '' muhammad and the believers : at the origins of islam '' , harvard university press , 2010 , the ansar , the leaders of the tribes of medina , met in a hall or house called saqifah , to discuss whom they would support as their new leader at buzakha in north central arabia , another claimed prophet , tulaiha , a tribal chief of bani asad , led the rebellion against medina aided by the allied tribes of banu ghatfan , the hawazin , and the tayy the negotiations were a success , and adi brought with him 500 horsemen of his tribe to reinforce khalid 's army moving south from buzakha , khalid reached naqra in october , with an army now 6000 strong , and defeated the rebel tribe of banu saleem in the battle of naqra this agreement stated that first , they would deal with local enemy tribes together , and then they would confront the state of madinah when khalid reached najd he found no opposing army malik avoided direct contact with khalid 's army and ordered his followers to scatter , and he and his family apparently moved away across the desert what remained of the apostasy in the less vital areas of arabia was rooted out by the muslims in a series of well planned campaigns within five months muhammad 's followers rapidly expanded the territory under muslim rule beyond arabia , muslim conquests ( from the iberian peninsula in west to modern day pakistan in east ) in a matter of decades in so doing , arabia soon became a politically peripheral region of the muslim world as the focus shifted to the caliphate from the 10th century to the early 20th century mecca and medina were under the control of a local arab ruler known as the sharif of mecca , but at most times the sharif owed allegiance to the ruler of one of the major islamic empires based in baghdad , cairo or istanbul most of the remainder of what became saudi arabia reverted to traditional tribal rule 68 the emergence of what was to become the saudi royal family , known as the al saud , began in nejd in central arabia in 1744 , when muhammad bin saud , founder of the dynasty , joined forces with the religious leader muhammad ibn abd al-wahhab , bowen , pp this alliance formed in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to saudi expansion and remains the basis of saudi arabian dynastic rule today the first '' saudi state '' established in 1744 in the area around riyadh , rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of saudi arabia , d a much smaller second '' saudi state '' , located mainly in nejd , was established in 1824 by turki retrieved from throughout the rest of the 19th century , the al saud contested control of the interior of what was to become saudi arabia with another arabian ruling family , the al rashid ibn saud gained the support of the ikhwan , a tribal army inspired by wahhabism , and which had grown quickly after its foundation in 1912 in 1916 , with the encouragement and support of britain ( which was fighting the ottomans in world war i ) , the sharif of mecca , hussein bin ali , led a arab revolt against the ottoman empire to create a united arab state although the arab revolt of 1916 to 1918 failed in its objective , the allied victory in world war i resulted in the end of ottoman suzerainty and control in arabia ibn saud avoided involvement in the arab revolt and instead continued his struggle with the al rashid this met with ibn saud 's opposition , as he recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the british at the same time , the ikhwan became disenchanted with ibn saud 's domestic policies which appeared to favor modernization and the increase in the number of non-muslim foreigners in the country as a result , they turned against ibn saud and , after a two-year struggle , were defeated in 1930 at the battle of sabilla , where their leaders were massacred in the early islamic centuries , najd was considered to extend as far north as the river euphrates , or more specifically , the '' walls of khosrau '' , constructed by the sassanid empire as a barrier between arabia and iraq immediately prior to the advent of islam under modern-day saudi arabia , however , najd is divided into three administrative regions : ha'il , al-qassim , and riyadh , comprising a combined area of uwidah metaireek al-juhany , najd before the salafi reform movement : social political and religious conditions during the three centuries preceding the rise of the saudi state ( garnet & ithaca press , 2002 : by the 20th century , many of the ancient tribes had morphed into new confederations or emigrated from other areas of the middle east , and many tribes from other regions of the peninsula had moved into najd most of the nomadic tribes are now settled either in cities such as riyadh , or in special settlements , known as hijras , that were established in the early part of the 20th century as part of a country-wide policy undertaken by ibn saud to put an end to nomadic life nomads still exist in the kingdom , however , in very small numbers – a far cry from the days when they made up the majority of the people of the arabian peninsula since the formation of modern saudi arabia , najd , and particularly riyadh , has seen an influx of immigrants from all regions of the country and from virtually every social class indeed , not even the ancient south arabian language appears to have been
