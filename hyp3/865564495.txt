similarly , a signal received from a satellite is firstly downconverter ( this is done by a low-noise block converter - lnb ) , then demodulated by a modem , and at last handled by data terminal equipment satellite communication standards also define error correction codes and framing formats frame formats that are supported by various satellite modems include : intelsat business service ( ibs ) framing intermediate data rate ( idr ) framing mpeg-2 transport framing ( used in dvb ) e1 and t1 framing high-end modems also incorporate some additional features : multiple data interfaces ( like rs-232 , rs-422 , v.35 , g.703 , lvds , ethernet ) ; embedded distant-end monitor and control ( edmac ) , allowing to control the distant-end modem ; automatic uplink power control ( aupc ) , that is , adjusting the output power to maintain a constant signal to noise ratio at the remote end ; drop and insert feature for a multiplexed stream , allowing to replace some channels in it the purpose of the analog tract in the receiver is to convert signal 's frequency , to adjust its power via an automatic gain control circuit and to get its complex envelope components the input signal for the analog tract is at the intermediate frequency or in the l-band , in the second case it must be firstly converted to if moreover , it is possible to develop a demodulator which can process signals with different modulation types digital demodulation implies that a symbol clock ( and , in most cases , an intermediate frequency generator ) at the receiving side have to be synchronous with those at the transmitting side if the analog signal was digitized without a four-quadrant multiplier , the complex envelope has to be calculated by a digital complex mixer sometimes a digital automatic gain control circuit is implemented in the demodulator error correction techniques are essential for satellite communications , because , due to satellite 's limited power a signal to noise ratio at the receiver is usually rather poor when differential coding is used , the data are deliberately made to depend not only on the current symbol , but also on the previous one satellite modem does n't have so many outputs , so a demultiplexer here performs a drop operation , allowing to choose channels that will be transferred to output
