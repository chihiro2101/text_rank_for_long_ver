in 1886 , adolf mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants , similar to bacterial infections in 1892 , dmitri ivanovsky gave the first concrete evidence for the existence of a non-bacterial infectious agent , showing that infected sap remained infectious even after filtering through the finest chamberland filters later , in 1903 , ivanovsky published a paper describing abnormal crystal intracellular inclusions in the host cells of the affected tobacco plants and argued the connection between these inclusions and the infectious agent however , ivanovsky remained rather convinced , despite repeated failures to produce evidence , that the causal agent was an unculturable bacterium , too small to be retained on the employed chamberland filters and to be detected in the light microscope in 1955 , heinz fraenkel-conrat and robley williams showed that purified tmv rna and its capsid ( coat ) protein assemble by themselves to functional viruses , indicating that this is the most stable structure ( the one with the lowest free energy ) the infection spreads by direct contact to the neighbouring cells , for its smooth entry , tmv produces a 30 kda movement protein called p30 which enlarges the plasmodesmata it can also spread through phloem for longer distance movement within the plant moreover , tmv can be transmitted from one plant to another by direct contact although tmv does not have defined transmission vectors , the virus can be easily transmitted from the infected hosts to the healthy plants , by human handling like other plant pathogenic viruses , tmv has a very wide host range and has different effects depending on the host being infected rugosity may also be seen where the infected plant leaves display small localized random wrinkles tmv is known as one of the most stable viruses furthermore , the cross protection method can be administered , where the stronger strain of tmv infection is inhibited by infecting the host plant with mild strain of tmv , similar to the effect of a vaccine in the past ten years , the application of genetic engineering on a host plant genome has been developed to allow the host plant to produce the tmv coat protein within their cells later it was found that the mechanism that protects the host from viral genome insertion is through gene silencing and a few simple laboratory procedures , a scientist can easily produce several grams of the virus plant viruses can be used to engineer viral vectors , tools commonly used by molecular biologists to deliver genetic material into plant cells ; they are also sources of biomaterials and nanotechnology devices
