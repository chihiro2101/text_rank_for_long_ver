rather , modified formulations with varying amounts of other comonomers , additives , and fillers are created for uses where specific properties are required for example , a small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in pmma grades destined for heat processing , since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization ( '' unzipping '' ) during processing plasticizers may be added to improve processing properties , lower the glass transition temperature , improve impact properties , and improve mechanical properties such as elastic modulus dyes may be added to give color for decorative applications , or to protect against ( or filter ) uv light being transparent and durable , pmma is a versatile material and has been used in a wide range of fields and applications such as rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles , appliances , and lenses for glasses methacrylate polymers are used extensively in medical and dental applications where purity and stability are critical to performance pmma is an important material in the making of certain lighthouse lenses soft contact lenses are often made of a related polymer , where acrylate monomers containing one or more hydroxyls make them hydrophile pmma as a soft tissue filler was widely used in the beginning of the century to restore volume in patients with hiv-related facial wasting due to its aforementioned biocompatibility , poly ( methyl methacrylate ) is a commonly used material in modern dentistry , particularly in the fabrication of dental prosthetics , artificial teeth , and orthodontic appliances through the use of injection molding techniques , wax based designs with artificial teeth set in predetermined positions built on gypsum stone models of patients ' mouths can be converted into functional prosthetics used to replace missing dentition though other methods of polymerizing pmma for prosthetic fabrication exist , such as chemical and microwave resin activation , the previously described heat-activated resin polymerization technique is the most commonly used due to its cost effectiveness and minimal polymerization shrinkage ; artificial teeth : while denture teeth can be made of several different materials , pmma is a material of choice for the manufacturing of artificial teeth used in dental prosthetics additionally , since the bases of dental prosthetics are often constructed using pmma , adherence of pmma denture teeth to pmma denture bases is unparalleled , leading to the construction of a strong and durable prosthetic acrylic paint essentially consists of pmma suspended in water ; however since pmma is hydrophobe , a substance with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups needs to be added to facilitate the suspension many other products ( for example , guitars ) are sometimes made with acrylic glass to make the commonly opaque objects translucent pmma , in the commercial form technovit 7200 is used vastly in the medical field it is used for plastic histology , electron microscopy , as well as many more uses pmma has been used to create ultra-white opaque membranes that are flexible and switch appearance to transparent when wet the type of acrylic used in tanning beds is most often formulated from a special type of polymethyl methacrylate , a compound that allows the passage of ultraviolet rays sheets of pmma are commonly used in the sign industry to make flat cut out letters in thicknesses typically varying from acrylic is also used extensively throughout the sign industry as a component of wall signs where it may be a backplate , painted on the surface or the backside , a faceplate with additional raised lettering or even photographic images printed directly to it , or a spacer to separate sign components ( cds and dvds use both acrylic and polycarbonate for impact resistance plastic optical fiber used for short distance communication is made from pmma , and perfluorinated pmma , clad with fluorinated pmma , in situations where its flexibility and cheaper installation costs outweigh its poor heat tolerance and higher attenuation over glass fiber pmma , in a purified form , is used as the matrix in laser dye-doped organic solid-state gain media for tunable solid state dye lasers small strips of pmma are used as dosimeter devices during the gamma irradiation process artificial nails in the '' acrylic '' type often include pmma powder
