multistriatus still acts as a vector for infection , it is much less effective than the large elm bark beetle , s 'field resistance ' is an umbrella term covering the various factors by which some elms avoid infection in the first place , rather than survive it this first strain was a relatively mild one , which killed only a small proportion of elms , more often just killing a few branches , and had largely died out by 1940 owing to its susceptibility to viruses this strain proved both highly contagious and lethal to european elms ; more than 25 million trees died in the united kingdom alone , while france lost 97 % of its elms their survival is owing to the isolation of the area , between the english channel and the south downs , and the assiduous efforts of local authorities to identify and remove infected sections of trees immediately when they show symptoms of the disease brighton and hove council page on the city 's elm collection ( viewed 2 june 2010 ) empowered by the dutch elm disease ( local authorities ) ( amendment ) order 1988 , local authorities may order the destruction of any infected trees or timber , although in practice they usually do it themselves , successfully reducing the numbers of elm bark beetle scolytus spp the united states national park service ( nps ) used a number of methods to control the epidemic , including sanitation , pruning , injecting trees with fungicide and replanting with ded-resistant american elm cultivars ( see ulmus americana cultivars ) alberta and british columbia are the only provinces that are currently free of dutch elm disease , although , in an isolated case , an elm tree in wainwright , alberta , was found diseased in june 1998 and was immediately destroyed today , alberta has the largest number of elms unaffected by dutch elm disease in the world the largest surviving urban forest of elm trees in north america is believed to be in the city of winnipeg , where close to 200,000 elms remain & nbsp ; – at least double that of amsterdam , the '' elm city of europe '' in the us , when dutch elm disease spread away from the atlantic coast , control focused on controlling the bark beetle by using insecticides such as ddt and dieldrin , which were sprayed heavily across all parts of elm trees , usually twice a year in the spring and again at a lower concentration in the summer in its early years , it was generally thought by observers that pesticides did slow the spread of the disease across the united states but as early as 1947 , concern was raised that many bird species were killed in large numbers by ingesting poisoned invertebrates biologist rachel carson consequently argued for improved sanitation and against spraying elms , which she saw as having been more effective in areas with earlier and greater experience countering dutch elm disease although modern critics of carson have argued that the bird deaths were caused by other factors such as mercury poisoning in the soil , spraying against elm bark beetles declined very rapidly after 1962 , a trend aided by fungicides without dangerous side-effects being discovered for the first time after many years of research arbotect must be injected every two to three years to provide ongoing control ; the disease generally can not be eradicated once a tree is infected about dutch trig® trials with the american elm have been very successful ; in a six-year experiment with the american elm in denver , co , annual dutch elm disease losses declined significantly after the first year from 7 percent to between 0.4 and 0.6 percent ; a greater and more rapid reduction in disease incidence than the accompanying tree sanitation and plant health care programs in 2005 , the national elm trial ( usa ) began a 10-year evaluation of 19 cultivars in plantings across the united states however this method , developed in the netherlands , was considered too severe in america , where the principal disease vector is the bark beetle scolytus multistriatus , a far less effective vector than the larger beetle endemic to europe , scolytus scolytus , which is unknown in america the differences in method and inocula possibly explain why the american cultivar 'princeton ' , displaying high resistance in the usa , has often succumbed to dutch elm disease in europe lutèce , a resistant variety , brings elms back to paris paris , france all found to have an extremely high resistance to the disease when inoculated with unnaturally large doses of the fungus rubra resulted in the release of 'coolshade ' and 'rosehill ' in the 1940s and 50s ; the species last featured in hybridization as the female parent of 'repura ' and 'revera ' , both patented in 1993 , although neither has yet appeared in commerce in italy , research is continuing at the istituto per la protezione delle piante , florence , to produce a range of disease-resistant trees adapted to the warmer mediterranean climate , using a variety of asiatic species crossed with the early dutch hybrid 'plantyn ' as a safeguard against any future mutation of the disease ten resistant american elm cultivars are now in commerce in north america , but only two ( 'princeton ' and 'valley forge ' ) are currently available in europe as trees planted in the 1920s still survive , the properties of the mature plant are well known however , 'princeton ' has not proven resistant in europe , where the main vector of the disease is the larger elm bark beetle , scolytus scolytus , capable of introducing far more fungal spores into the tree ; many of the 50 trees planted by hrh charles , prince of wales , in 2006 at highgrove had died from dutch elm disease by 2011 'american liberty ' , is , in fact , a set of six cultivars of moderate to high resistance produced through selection over several generations starting in the 1970s although 'american liberty ' is marketed as a single variety , nurseries selling the '' liberty elm '' actually distribute the six cultivars at random and thus , unfortunately , the resistance of any particular tree can not be known 'valley forge ' , released in 1995 , has demonstrated the highest resistance of all the clones to dutch elm disease in controlled usda tests in 2007 , the elm recovery project of the university of guelph arboretum in ontario , canada , reported that cuttings from healthy surviving old elms surveyed across ontario had been grown to produce a bank of resistant trees , isolated for selective breeding of highly resistant cultivars rubra is marginally less susceptible to dutch elm disease than the other american species , but this quality seems to have been largely ignored in american research among european species , there is the unique example of the european white elm u recent research has indicated it is the presence of certain organic compounds , such as triterpenes and sterols , which serves to make the tree bark unattractive to the beetle species that spread the disease screening european elms for resistance to 'ophiostoma novo-ulmi ' ( forest science 2005 ) the first results of this ongoing project suggest that in some countries a very small number of native field elm genotypes have comparatively high levels of tolerance to ded in spain , for example , of around 5,000 native elms evaluated to 2013 , some 25 genotypes ( 0.5 % of those tested ) fall into this category ; and it is now hoped that the controlled crossing of the best seven of these ( genetically and aesthetically ) will produce ulmus minor hybrids with effective 'field resistance ' and market appeal much of the work in the united kingdom is by the forestry commission 's research arm , which has had dutch elm disease on its agenda since the 1920s in england the conservation foundation has begun propagating , distributing and planting clones of surviving indigenous elms , including field elms ( but not the highly susceptible english elm ) , as part of a scheme to return elms to city and countryside ' '' super tree '' from northamptonshire helping to fight dutch elm disease and repopulate woodlands ' , northamptonchron.co.uk the foundation is currently running two elm programmes : the 'great british elm experiment ' and 'ulmus londinium ' , an elm programme for london – these use saplings cultivated through micropropagation from mature parent elms found growing in the british countryside : parent trees are monitored for disease , while saplings are offered free to schools and community groups , who are asked to monitor their trees ' progress on the foundation 's online elm map ;
