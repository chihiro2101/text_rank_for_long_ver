makers developed '' moustache '' handlebars , allowing the rider 's knees to clear them , '' whatton '' handlebars that wrapped around behind the legs , and ultimately ( though too late , after development of the safety bicycle ) , the american '' eagle '' and '' star '' bicycles , whose large and small wheels were reversed other attempts included moving the seat rearward and driving the wheel by levers or treadles , as in the '' xtraordinary '' and '' facile '' , or gears , by chain as in the '' kangaroo '' or at the hub , as in the '' crypto '' ; another option was to move the seat well back , as in the '' rational '' an attribute of the penny-farthing is that the rider sits high and nearly over the front axle riders coasting down hills often took their feet off the pedals and put them over the tops of the handlebars , so they would be pitched off feet-first instead of head-first for example , when cyclist thomas stevens rode around the world in the 1880s , he reported only one significant mechanical problem in over , caused when the local military confiscated his bicycle and damaged the front wheel the first was the chain drive , originally used on tricycles , allowing a gear ratio to be chosen independent of the wheel size james starley had built the ariel ( spirit of the air ) high-wheeler in 1870 ; but this was a time of innovation , and when chain drives were upgraded so that each link had a small roller , higher and higher speeds became possible without the large wheel in 1885 , starley 's nephew john kemp starley took these new developments to launch the modern bicycle , the rover safety bicycle , so-called because the rider , seated much lower and farther behind the front wheel contact point , was less prone to a header this shifts the rider nearly on top of the wheel and makes it impossible for the rider to reach the ground while sitting on the seat the frame is a single tube following the circumference of the front wheel , then diverting to a trailing wheel one particular model , made by pope manufacturing company in 1886 , weighs , has a 60-spoke front wheel and a 20-spoke rear wheel another model , made by humber cycles , of beeston , nottingham , england , weighs only , and has and wheels a third model , also made by pope manufacturing company , weighs and has forged steel forks the rider must first grasp the handlebar and place one foot on a peg above the back wheel the center of mass being high and not far behind the front wheel means any sudden stop or collision with a pothole or other obstruction can send the rider over the handlebars a new type of handlebar was introduced , called whatton bars , that looped behind the legs so that riders could still keep their feet on the pedals and also be able to leap forward feet-first off the machine capitol steps with the american star bicycle which has the small wheel in front a 60-inch gear , the largest practicable size for a high-wheeler , is nowadays a middle gear of a utility bicycle , while top gears on many exceed 100 & nbsp ; inches there was at least one columbia made in the mid-1880s , but 60 was the largest in regular production in 2012 , the first clustered spires high wheel race took place in frederick , maryland , usa
