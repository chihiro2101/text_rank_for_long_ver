3 : shell and tube heat exchanger , 2-pass shell side , 2-pass tube side ( 2-2 countercurrent ) there are three primary classifications of heat exchangers according to their flow arrangement for efficiency , heat exchangers are designed to maximize the surface area of the wall between the two fluids , while minimizing resistance to fluid flow through the exchanger on the other hand , their low efficiency coupled with the high space occupied in large scales , has led modern industries to use more efficient heat exchangers like shell and tube or plate the flow may be a current flow or parallel flow in a double pipe heat exchanger if this is done under comparable conditions , more heat is transferred to the counter-flow device than to the parallel flow heat exchanger the baffles are used to support the tubes , direct the fluid flow to the tubes in an approximately natural manner , and maximize the turbulence of the shell fluid in application to cool air with shell-and-tube technology ( such as intercooler / charge air cooler for combustion engines ) , fins can be added on the tubes to increase heat transfer area on air side and create a tubes & fins configuration surface condenser is the most common type of condenser where it includes a water supply device the word steam generator was regularly used to describe a boiler unit where a hot liquid stream is the source of heat rather than the combustion products thumb shell and tube heat exchangers consist of a series of tubes which contain fluid that must be either heated or cooled a second fluid runs over the tubes that are being heated or cooled so that it can either provide the heat or absorb the heat required shell and tube heat exchangers are typically used for high-pressure applications ( with pressures greater than 30 bar and temperatures greater than 260 & nbsp ; Â°c ) this is because the shell and tube heat exchangers are robust due to their shape however , it is more likely for the heat exchanger to foul up faster and the small size makes mechanical cleaning of the fouling difficult to prevail over the fouling and cleaning problems , larger tube diameters can be used thus to determine the tube diameter , the available space , cost and fouling nature of the fluids must be considered tube thickness : the thickness of the wall of the tubes is usually determined to ensure : there is enough room for corrosion that flow-induced vibration has resistance axial strength availability of spare parts hoop strength ( to withstand internal tube pressure ) buckling strength ( to withstand overpressure in the shell ) tube length : heat exchangers are usually cheaper when they have a smaller shell diameter and a long tube length a larger tube pitch leads to a larger overall shell diameter , which leads to a more expensive heat exchanger tube corrugation : this type of tubes , mainly used for the inner tubes , increases the turbulence of the fluids and the effect is very important in the heat transfer giving a better performance the triangular patterns are employed to give greater heat transfer as they force the fluid to flow in a more turbulent fashion around the piping are used in shell and tube heat exchangers to direct fluid across the tube bundle this type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow tubes & fins design : in application to cool air with shell-and-tube technology ( such as intercooler / charge air cooler for combustion engines ) , the difference in heat transfer between air and cold fluid can be such that there is a need to increase heat transfer area on air side for this function fins can be added on the tubes to increase heat transfer area on air side and create a tubes & fins configuration these exchangers are composed of many thin , slightly separated plates that have very large surface areas and small fluid flow passages for heat transfer another difference between the two is that plate exchangers typically serve low to medium pressure fluids , compared to medium and high pressures of shell and tube a fourth type of heat exchanger uses an intermediate fluid or solid store to hold heat , which is then moved to the other side of the heat exchanger to be released two examples of this are adiabatic wheels , which consist of a large wheel with fine threads rotating through the hot and cold fluids , and fluid heat exchangers this type of heat exchanger uses '' sandwiched '' passages containing fins to increase the effectiveness of the unit plate and fin heat exchangers are usually made of aluminum alloys , which provide high heat transfer efficiency advantages of plate and fin heat exchangers : high heat transfer efficiency especially in gas treatment larger heat transfer area approximately 5 times lighter in weight than that of shell and tube heat exchanger after welding the enclosed space is pressurised with sufficient force to cause the thin metal to bulge out around the welds , providing a space for heat exchanger liquids to flow , and creating a characteristic appearance of a swelled pillow formed out of metal this is a heat exchanger with a gas passing upwards through a shower of fluid ( often water ) , and the fluid is then taken elsewhere before being cooled the recovery of heat from low temperature systems requires different working fluids than steam air pollution control orientation course from website of the air pollution training institute energy savings in steam systems figure 3a , layout of surface condenser ( scroll to page 11 of 34 pdf pages ) to conserve energy and cooling capacity in chemical and other plants , regenerative heat exchangers can transfer heat from a stream that must be cooled to another stream that must be heated , such as distillate cooling and reboiler feed pre-heating direct contact heat exchangers involve heat transfer between hot and cold streams of two phases in the absence of a separating wall architectural engineering chemical engineering cooling tower copper in heat exchangers heat pipe heat pump heat recovery ventilation jacketed vessel log mean temperature difference ( lmtd ) marine heat exchangers mechanical engineering micro heat exchanger moving bed heat exchanger packed bed and in particular packed columns pumpable ice technology reboiler recuperator , or cross plate heat exchanger regenerator run around coil steam generator ( nuclear power ) surface condenser toroidal expansion joint thermosiphon thermal wheel , or rotary heat exchanger ( including enthalpy wheel and desiccant wheel ) tube tool waste heat
