references to the khitan people in china sources date back to the 4th century they had been identified as a distinct ethnic group since paying tribute to the northern wei dynasty in the mid-6th century during the time of the china tang dynasty the khitan people were vassals to the suzerain tang or turks , depending on the balance of power between the two , or the suzerain uyghurs when they replaced the turks as the main steppe power 44–50 in the 6th century , the khitan tribes were still a weak confederation after being heavily defeated in 553 by the northern qi who enslaved many khitans and seized a large part of their livestock , choc 6 , p46 leading to harsh times for the khitans military activities during the first half of the tang dynasty ( 618–735 ) despite some occasional clashes , the khitans remained chinese vassals until the 690s when wu zetian took the throne of china opposition rose because of the behaviour of zhao wenhui , who treated khitan chieftains as his servants and refused to provide help during a famine that struck the khitan area in 696 sun wanrong assisted him as general who successfully led tens of thousands of troops marching southward and conquered several other towns of tang dynasty the first significant chinese response was to send an army led by twenty-eight generals , but they were defeated by khitans in the battle of xiashi gorge ( near modern lulong county of hebei province ) in the eighth month of 696 second tujue empire , 682–745 ) and the khagan ashina mochuo , who had supported the khitan rebellion , switched to empress wu 's side after the chinese gave him several promises including an imperial marriage for his daughter , adoption as the son of empress wu , the relocating of his people to ( hexi corridor ) and the restoration of turkish overlordship of the khitans this time , tang forces planned to attack khitan from the south and the turks would also invade khitan from north instead , they somehow allied with empress wu and launched a massive attack on khitans meanwhile , kumo xi , another minority group who initially allied with khitan in this rebellion , switched to tang in this critical situation , sun wanrong was assassinated by one of his own subordinates , and the khitan force collapsed after this rebellion , khitans began a new allegiance with the turks as mochou khaghan and the empress wu had planned early in 696 they were defeated by tang troops in 681 in a pyrrhic victory , also , the remaining eastern turks reunited under ilterish qaghan ( died 691 ) who was able to proclaim the rebirth of the turkish empire without tang 's reaction xu elina-qian , p.243–245 when li-sun died , his brother-in-law sun wanrong replaced him and engaged the turks in an aggressive policy of '' plunder to strengthen '' as the best way to revitalize his empire almost as soon as the khitan rebelled and were successful the turks proposed an alliance with china the turks , engaged in a war against china , were just asking the khitans for a diversion in the east allowing them to be more free on their front by attacking khitan on their rear the turks provided an inestimable help to tang which also worked for themselves by crushing that eastern rising power while the fourth chinese campaign was still not launched , and despite previous propositions of alliance , the turks attacked the chinese territories to show clearly they were strong in the third month of 697 along with the final victory they freed some turkish prisoners held in six chinese northern border prefectures since 670–674 , gained the submission of both the khitan and the xi , plundered a large amount of grain , silk , farming implements and iron as well as winning noble titles for the mochou khaghan ( such as general , khaghan and other noble ranks ) and the asked for imperial marriage as is often the case the plot was disclosed and ketuyu 's troops attacked the king who fled to yingzhou to get chinese support peaceful relations were restored and when ketuyu made a second coup to face the new king tuyu suspicions , the tang court peacefully confirmed the newly enthroned king shaogu ( 李邵固 li shaogu , 725–730 ) who on his side displayed respect for tang 's wishes of appeasement back in the khitan territories ketuyu assassinated the pro-tang shaogu in the fifth month of 730 and switched the allegiance of his subjects , and of the xi tribes , from tang to the türks sending a clear message to tang ketuyu then attacked pinglu ( part of yingzhou in the third month of 732 the khitan-xi troops were defeated by the prince of xin'an and ketuyu had to flee while li shi suogao , the xi king , betrayed him submitting to tang with his 5,000 subjects note : what is this ? it was just 5,000 xi at this time ? getting the titles of the prince of guiyi ( allegiance and righteousness ) and prefect of guiyi zhou with the xi allowed to settle in youzhou under chinese protection ketuyu came first with turkish support putting the chinese-xi troops in difficulty forcing the xi to flee to save themselves ketuyu , seeing the khitan forces exhausted by repetitive tang campaigns , pretended to surrender in the twelfth month of 734 and was murdered , together with his puppet king qulie ( 李屈列 li qulie 730–734 ) , by his subordinate li guozhe ( 李過折 ) also in prosperous times such as xuanzong 's reign , and his courage in facing the 720 's coup , tang officials immediately sent an army to support the dethroned pro-tang king clearly interfering in khitan internal affairs in the third month of 736 zhang shougui , the general commander of youzhou , sent his protected an lushan , an officer of the pinglu army ( 平盧軍 ) based in modern chaoyang who was said to know 6 languages of chinese , to attack khitan and the xi rebels but an lushan made an overtly audacious attack which cost him almost all of his troops in the third month of 745 several tang princesses were married to khitan 's leaders in a sign of appeasement but for some reason what ? the khitans soon turned into an open rebellion against tang in the ninth month of 745 killing the princesses and starting military operations in 751–752 , following an lushan 's provocations and harassment , the khitans moved south to attack the chinese tang empire accordinglys khitan were soon subject to a chinese campaign in the eighth month of 751 : an lushan assisted by 2,000 xi guides leading 60,000 chinese troops into khitan territories when the fighting started the xi suddenly turned their support to khitan and the khitan-xi army then quickly pushed against the tang armies who were hampered by rains the defending general su dingfang , a tang general , was eventually able to stop the khitan pursuit troops which retreated ; background reasons of these oppositions the continuous agitation of khitans on the northeast of the empire , maintained by an lushan actions , provided an lushan more and more support troops from chang'an for his own power and ambitions growing to 160,000–200,000 men this was caused by several factors : an lushan seemed to be a clever military official especially skilled to set up good relationships with his superiors , whatever by systematic brides ( as say sources ) or by his possible real abilities ; an lushan was skilled to both : up khitan 's aggressivity , enlarge the threat in his rapports , and trap/crush them , getting large praises the time ( 740s ) was an apogee of prosperity , the treasury was full , the chinese empire was at a maximum of extension , xuanzong and chang'an officials sur-estimated their own power and displayed growing mark of lazy behaviour and management : waste of financial resources , lack of troops in the central area ; in chang'an , the high chancellor li linfu , facing to the rise of the yang clan in chang'an , wanted both to resist the khitans ' pressure and counterbalance the growing influence of the yang clan in chang'an affairs the new '' steppe lords '' were relatively peaceful while the tang dynasty was later greatly weakened by the an-shi rebellion of 755–763 providing a new intra-china situation with a weak center and with provincial generals pacification and strengthening of their respective provinces while previous centuries had seen successive turko-chinese provocations or recall to obeisance , and the following wars had prevented khitan gaining any notable expansion , the 8th-century situation eventually allowed one part of the kumo xi-khitan tribal complex xu elina-qian , p.264 388- ?
