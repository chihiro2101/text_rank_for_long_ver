from the end of the 20th century , the canal has offered many activities the canal du midi is now used primarily by tourists , recreation , and housing this is one of the fundamental roles of the canal and one of the reasons for its maintenance by the state since the end of commercial traffic in addition , individual samples are collected from the water on the area between revel and the seuil de naurouze project to enlarge lake ganguise near the old basin of naurouze the naurouze pumping station helps to regulate the water in the canal du midi and the lake conversely , during the dry season , lake ganguise can supply the canal du midi if the water supply of the rigole de la plaine is not enough the canal has also provided a supply of drinking water through the water treatment plants at picotalen ( picotalen i and picotalen ii ) since 1973 while the canal was once seen as a tool of production , trade , and commerce it is now considered to be architectural and technical heritage as evidenced by the refusal of the mayor of toulouse , pierre baudis , to allow space on the canal du midi to be used for an urban expressway the canal is a heavy heritage to maintain and enhance as the manager of french canals , voies navigables de france ( vnf ) , specializes in the management and maintenance of french canals in a market and commercial economy and not in the tourism market where the canal du midi is located nevertheless , to respect the uniformity of the canal development and support efforts for improvement , the canal du midi remains under the management of vnf under the tutelage of the state who want to create a monitoring mission like the loire and mont-saint-michel to do this , riquet set up a complex system of water supply to the canal the idea was to capture the waters of the montagne noire located several tens of kilometres away and bring it to the seuil de naurouze , the highest point of the future canal , through channels initially , two reservoirs fed the highest point of the canal at the seuil de naurouze : the bassin de saint-ferréol had a capacity of 6.3 & nbsp ; million cubic metres and was built between 1667 and 1672 the bassin de saint-ferréol was and remains the main water reservoir for the canal with a surface of 67 hectares the lake waters are retained by a dam 786m long and 149m wide consisting of three parallel walls originally the engineer planned and built a third reservoir , the naurouze , but it was abandoned in 1680 due to its excessive silting pierre-paul riquet had dreamed of the construction of a new city around this basin that never saw the day other reservoirs were also built at carcassonne to supply the lower part of the canal to the mediterranean on the other hand , the waters of the orb at beziers provided additional flow to part of the canal supply of water to the canal , canal-du-midi.org , consulted on 16 october 2007 this system allows triple access while protecting the canal from river flooding similarly , the canal has several multiple locks – i.e several ports were built at regular intervals along the route of the canal in order to load and unload goods and also to provide stopping-places for travellers carcassonne is today a major tourist stop on the canal and has a port built in 1810 at the time when the city was connected to the canal there are also the ports of homps which was one of the most important on the canal and le somail which was a popular place for rest and recreation newer ports were built such as ramonville-saint-agne , called port-sud , which has many residential barges and is set directly overlooking the harbour , and port-lauragais located near avignonet-lauragais on a service area of the a61 autoroute related article : aqueducts on the canal du midi several aqueducts an aqueduct is a 'canal bridge ' ( pont-canal in french ) carrying a canal over a river or valley , or any depression in the terrain the same word in english is used for any overhead structure carrying water , while the french equivalent aqueduc refers to a water conveyance structure or ( as in the case of the canal du mid ) a siphon or culvert under the canal were built along the route of the canal du midi they allow the canal to cross rivers that could disrupt the water flow in the canal it was also the first aqueduct built by pierre-paul riquet orbiel aqueduct at trebes ( pk 117 ) fresquel aqueduct ( pk 109 ) was built beginning in 1800 and opened on 31 may 1810 , as a result of the realignment of the route to pass through the centre of the city of carcassonne , a city that refused to pay a share of the cost when the canal was first built herbettes aqueduct , ( pk 8 ) , a new aqueduct at toulouse completed in 1983 , 74m long , to cross a four-lane motorway pierre-paul riquet and the engineers who followed him over three centuries built many other structures on the canal du midi , of which the most important are listed here : the malpas tunnel 165m long southeast of the oppidum d'ensérune béziers , topographic map at 1/25000 scale , ign series , '' top 25 '' no which passes through a hill 50m above sea level and was a technical challenge for the time the argent-double spillway located in la redorte near the argent-double aqueduct : this work incorporates eleven successive stone arches contemporary to vauban , its designer ; it was built by antoine de niquet and allows for the overflow water from the canal to be discharged into the stream the fonserannes water slope , which bypasses the 6-lock staircase at fonserannes , was built at the time when the canal was to be upgraded to freycinet gauge to save time and allow larger vessels to work on it has a unique machinery whose maintenance is expensive , but for several years , vnf has attempted to rehabilitate it to reduce waiting times at the fonséranes locks the ouvrages du libron ( the works of libron ) , a unique achievement of its kind which allows the canal to cross the course of the libron near agde the watermills of the canal du midi are located in derivation of the number of locks ( e.g the canal is also a very vegetated place the engineer also planted irises on the side of the canal to reduce subsidence of its banks in the 18th century , the trees planted along the canal become a source of income it was under the first empire that platanus began to be planted to replace the cut trees , which are today the dominant variety along the canal in 15 to 20 years all 42,000 plane trees of the canal du midi will have to be felled and replaced mainly by other species ( ash , lime ) , after initial experiments with a variety of plane-tree resisting the parasite the sacrifice of plane trees on the canal du midi in lefigaro.fr , 27 july 2011 the canal du midi was one of the great achievements of the late 17th century the canal became an example in europe as throughout the age of enlightenment it was the only canal of this size in europe as the united states ambassador to france he envisaged the construction of a similar work to link the potomac river to lake erie he obtained from the king the ownership and operation of the canal du midi for life for himself and his descendants english : canal du midi and la nouvelle branch , with maps and details of places , ports and moorings , by the author of inland waterways of france , imray navigation details for 80 french rivers and canals ( french waterways website section ) aude pays cathare history and heritage website canal du midi map , photos & info canal du midi unesco property on google arts and culture french : old maps drawn by françois garipuy association of the canal du midi en languedoc history of the canal du midi a personal website in french canal-du-midi.org inter-regional directorate vnf ( south-west ) inter-communal tourism for the canal du midi website actions taken by vnf to save the heritage of trees of the canal canal du midi carcassonne intermunicipal tourist office of the canal du midi
