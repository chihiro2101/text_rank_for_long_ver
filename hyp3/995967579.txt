after leaving the subway at the south end , trams turned right along the embankment to westminster bridge or left on a service from bloomsbury to the hop exchange south from here the subway was built with a steel roof to aldwych tramway station and , because it was not initially planned to run a public service south of here , the tracks leading towards the strand were used as a depot with appropriate equipment and inspection pits the opening of the new tramway along the embankment meant it was decided to link up with this route instead and the station was never built the kennington service was not commercially viable and services were diverted to operate to queens road in battersea which , due to a low bridge , could be operated with single-deck vehicles only drivers of the trams recorded difficulty in climbing the ramp north from holborn tramway station and would sometimes roll all the way back to the station service patterns continued to change , especially with the opening of tram lines over blackfriars bridge on 14 september 1909 , and during the 1920s it was realised that to remain profitable the subway needed to be able to take double-deck trams the replacement programme proceeded swiftly until 1940 , when the last of the pre-war series of conversions occurred , leaving only the south london trams and the subway routes 31 , 33 and 35 , the only north london tram routes to survive the war in 1937 , the rebuilding of waterloo bridge required the diversion of the side entrance to the tramway to a new position centrally underneath the bridge , which opened on 21 november of that year trams were abandoned in london on 5 july 1952 , after which street tracks were lifted , but those in the subway mostly remain in place in 1953 , london transport used the tramway to store 120 unused buses and coaches in case they were needed for the coronation but proposals to convert the tramway subway to a car park or a film studio failed and it was leased out as a storage facility from october 1957 in june 1958 , the london county council proposed making use of the subway for light traffic from waterloo bridge in order to reduce traffic congestion at its junction with strand and , in april 1962 , the go-ahead was given for part of the southern end of the subway to be used until the opening of the thames barrier in 1984 , a portable building near the north of the tunnel was used as a flood control headquarters for the greater london council although following the same route along kingsway , it was not envisaged that the proposed cross river tram would use the subway
