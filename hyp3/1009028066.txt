plain radiography was the only imaging modality available during the first 50 years of radiology due to its availability , speed , and lower costs compared to other modalities , radiography is often the first-line test of choice in radiologic diagnosis also despite the large amount of data in ct scans , mr scans and other digital-based imaging , there are many disease entities in which the classic diagnosis is obtained by plain radiographs mammography and dxa are two applications of low energy projectional radiography , used for the evaluation for breast cancer and osteoporosis , respectively additionally , in specific circumstances , air can be used as a contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system ; in these cases , the contrast agent attenuates the x-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues spiral multidetector ct uses 16 , 64 , 254 or more detectors during continuous motion of the patient through the radiation beam to obtain fine detail images in a short exam time continuing improvements in ct technology , including faster scanning times and improved resolution , have dramatically increased the accuracy and usefulness of ct scanning , which may partially account for increased use in medical diagnosis medical ultrasonography uses ultrasound ( high-frequency sound waves ) to visualize soft tissue structures in the body in real time no ionizing radiation is involved , but the quality of the images obtained using ultrasound is highly dependent on the skill of the person ( ultrasonographer ) performing the exam and the patient 's body size its use in medical imaging has developed mostly within the last 30 years the first ultrasound images were static and two-dimensional ( 2d ) , but with modern ultrasonography , 3d reconstructions can be observed in real time , effectively becoming '' 4d '' the progression of pregnancies can be thoroughly evaluated with less concern about damage from the techniques employed , allowing early detection and diagnosis of many fetal anomalies color-flow doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart , heart valves and major vessels one disadvantage is the patient has to hold still for long periods of time in a noisy , cramped space while the imaging is performed recent improvements in magnet design including stronger magnetic fields ( 3 teslas ) , shortening exam times , wider , shorter magnet bores and more open magnet designs , have brought some relief for claustrophobic patients areas of potential advancement include functional imaging , cardiovascular mri , and mri-guided therapy while anatomy detail is limited in these studies , nuclear medicine is useful in displaying physiology function in the most modern devices , nuclear medicine images can be fused with a ct scan taken quasisimultaneously , so the physiology information can be overlaid or coregistered with the anatomical structures to improve diagnostic accuracy pet/mri fusion , largely practiced in academic and research settings , could potentially play a crucial role in fine detail of brain imaging , breast cancer screening , and small joint imaging of the foot the technology recently blossomed after passing the technical hurdle of altered positron movement in strong magnetic field thus affecting the resolution of pet images and attenuation correction the images provide maps that allow the clinician to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing disease however , beforehand the geometrical adjustment and general alignment of optical density should be done another possibility of radiographic image analysis is to study second order features , e.g they take an intakt bone image sample ( region of interest , roi , reference site ) and a sample of the implantation site ( second roi , test site ) can be assessed numerically/objectively to what extent the implantation site imitates a healthy bone and how advanced is the process of bone regeneration it is also possible to check whether the bone healing process is influenced by some systemic factors teleradiology is the transmission of radiographic images from one location to another for interpretation by an appropriately trained professional , usually a radiologist or reporting radiographer it is most often used to allow rapid interpretation of emergency room , icu and other emergent examinations after hours of usual operation , at night and on weekends , many hospitals outsource their radiology departments to radiologists in india due to the lowered cost and availability of high speed internet access the computer at the receiving end will need to have a high-quality display screen that has been tested and cleared for clinical purposes the major advantage of teleradiology is the ability to use different time zones to provide real-time emergency radiology services around-the-clock radiology is a field in medicine that has expanded rapidly after 2000 due to advances in computer technology , which is closely linked to modern imaging techniques recertification examinations are taken every 10 years , with additional required continuing medical education as outlined in the maintenance of certification document following completion of residency training , radiologists may either begin practicing as a general diagnostic radiologist or enter into subspecialty training programs known as fellowships fellowship training programs in radiology are usually one or two years in length some medical schools in the us have started to incorporate a basic radiology introduction into their core md training after achieving a certificate of completion of training ( cct ) , many fellowship posts exist in specialities such as neurointervention and vascular intervention , which would allow the ioctor to work as an interventional radiologist radiographers often may control a '' list '' of a particular set of procedures after being approved locally and signed off by a consultant radiologist in 2000 , the society of interventional radiology ( sir ) created a program named '' clinical pathway in ir '' , which modified the '' holman pathway '' that was already accepted by the american board of radiology to including training in ir ; this was accepted by abr but was not widely adopted in 2005 sir proposed and abr accepted another pathway called '' direct ( diagnostic and interventional radiology enhanced clinical training ) pathway '' to help trainees coming from other specialities learn ir ; this too was not widely adopted in 2006 sir proposed a pathway resulting in certification in ir as a speciality ; this was eventually accepted by the abr in 2007 and was presented to the american board of medical specialities ( abms ) in 2009 , which rejected it because it did not include enough diagnostic radiology ( dr ) training
