however , a small number of exact solutions exist , most notably the five orbits referred to as '' lagrange points '' , which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one body is significantly more massive there are in fact an infinite number of paths taking one to the point and away from it , and all of which require nearly zero change in energy to reach this makes sense , since the orbit is unstable , which implies one will eventually end up on one of the outbound paths after spending no energy at all the transfers are so low-energy that they make travel to almost any point in the solar system possible nevertheless , they have already been used to transfer spacecraft to the earth–sun point , a useful point for studying the sun that was employed in a number of recent missions , including the genesis mission , the first to return solar wind samples to earth the itn is based around a series of orbital paths predicted by chaos theory and the restricted three-body problem leading to and from the orbits around the lagrange points – points in space where the gravity between various bodies balances with the centrifugal force of an object there these five points have particularly low delta-v requirements , and appear to be the lowest-energy transfers possible , even lower than the common hohmann transfer orbit that has dominated orbital navigation since the start of space travel the entire system is in motion , so the spacecraft will not actually hit the moon , but will travel in a winding path , off into space there is , however , a semi-stable orbit around each of these points , called a halo orbit in addition to orbits around lagrange points , the rich dynamics that arise from the gravitational pull of more than one mass yield interesting trajectories , also known as low energy transfers the spacecraft was able to maneuver around the earth 's neighborhood using little fuel by taking advantage of the unique gravity environment another example of the use of the itn was nasa 's 2001–2003 genesis mission , which orbited the sun–earth point for over two years collecting material , before being redirected to the lagrange point , and finally redirected from there back to earth ross , american scientist , may–june 2006 ( subscription ) '' ride the celestial subway '' new scientist , 27 march 2006 '' tube route '' science , 18 november 2005 '' navigating celestial currents '' science news , 18 april 2005 '' next exit 0.5 million kilometers '' engineering and science , 2002 '' mathematics unites the heavens and the atom , '' space daily , 28 september 2005 '' asteroids lost in space '' physical review focus , 14 june 2002 interplanetary transport network lecture ( youtube ) by shane d
