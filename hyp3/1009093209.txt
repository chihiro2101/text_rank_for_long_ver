a recent study , with more comprehensive sampling of the madeira system , including above and below the teotonio rapids ( which were thought to obstruct gene flow ) , found that the inia above the rapids did not possess unique mtdna the length of its fins allows the animal to perform a circular movement , allowing for exceptional maneuverability to swim through the flooded forest but decreasing its speed despite small eyes , the species seems to have good eyesight in and out of the water life expectancy of the amazon river dolphin in the wild is unknown , but in captivity , the longevity of healthy individuals has been recorded at between 10 and 30 years the amazon river dolphin are commonly seen singly or in twos , but may also occur in pods that rarely contain more than eight individuals pods as large as 37 individuals have been seen in the amazon , but average is three during prey time , as many as 35 pink dolphins work together to obtain their prey due to the high level of prey fish , larger group-sizes are seen in large sections that are directly influenced by whitewater ( such as main rivers and lakes , especially during low water season ) than in smaller sections influenced by blackwater ( such as channels and smaller tributaries ) captive studies have shown that the amazon river dolphin is less shy than the bottlenose dolphin , but also less sociable however , dolphins in captivity may not show the same behavior that they do in their natural environment , where they have been reported to hold the oars of the fishermen , rub against the boat , pluck underwater plants , and play with sticks , logs , clay , turtles , snakes , and fish the period of birthing coincides with the flood season , and this may provide an advantage because the females and their offspring remain in flooded areas longer than males the diet is more diverse during the wet season , when fish are spread in flooded areas outside riverbeds , thus becoming more difficult to catch apparently , there is little competition for food between these species , as each prefers different prey it has also been observed that captive dolphins share food amazonian rivers are often very murky , and the amazon river dolphin is therefore likely to depend much more on its sense of echolocation than vision when navigating and finding prey however , echolocation in shallow waters and flooded forests may result in many echoes to keep track of this may be why the amazon river dolphin produces less powerful clicks compared to other similar sized toothed whales toothed whales generally do not produce a new echolocation click until all relevant echoes from the previous click have been received , so if detectable echoes are only reflected back from nearby objects , the echoes will quickly return , and the amazon river dolphin is then able to click at a high rate this in turn allow these animals to have a high acoustic update rate on their surroundings which may aid prey tracking when echolocating in shallow rivers and flooded forests with plenty of hiding places for the prey the issuance of these sounds is related to the time they return to the surface before diving , suggesting a link to food additionally , another study was conducted in the amazon at the height of the mouth of the caqueta river for six days cyclical changes in the water levels of rivers take place throughout the year males and females appear to have selective habitat preferences , with the males returning to the main river channels when water levels are still high , while the females and their offspring remain in the flooded areas as long as possible ; probably because it decreases the risk of aggression by males toward the young and predation by other species in a previous study conducted at the center of the amazon river , a dolphin was observed that moved only a few dozen kilometers from the dry season and wet season one of these ecosystems is a floodplain , or a v√°rzea forest , and is home to a large number of fish species which are an essential resource for human consumption in addition to attracting predators such as the amazon river dolphin , these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species , the tambaqui ( colossoma macropomum ) and the pirapitinga ( piaractus brachypomus ) , resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the amazon river dolphin the local fishermen overfish and when the amazon river dolphins remove the commercial catch from the nets and lines , it causes damages to the equipment and the capture , as well as generating ill will from the local fishermen the negative reactions of the local fishermen are also attributed to the brazilian institute of environment and renewable natural resources prohibition on killing the amazon river dolphin , yet not compensating the fishermen for the damage done to their equipment and catch increasing demand for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions the data do not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the amazon river dolphins , whether accidental or intentional , because a variety of factors make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses scavenger species feed upon the carcasses , and the complexity of the river currents make it nearly impossible to locate all of the dead animals more importantly , the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that a legal course of action will be taken against them , as the amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under a brazilian federal law prohibiting any takes , harassments , and kills of the species however , increased human intervention on their habitat is expected to , in the future , be the most likely cause of the decline of its range and population a series of recommendations were issued to ensure proper follow-up to the species , among which is the implementation and publication of studies on the structure of populations , making a record of the distribution of the species , information about potential threats as the magnitude of fishing operations and location of pipelines another source of concern is the difficulty in keeping these animals alive in captivity , due to intra-species aggression and low longevity others believe the myth served ( and still serves ) as a way of hiding the incestuous relations which are quite common in some small , isolated communities along the river legend also states that if a person makes eye contact with an amazon river dolphin , he or she will have lifelong nightmares local legends also state that the dolphin is the guardian of the amazonian manatee , and that if one should wish to find a manatee , one must first make peace with the dolphin in inland cities far from the coast , many , if not most , of the fetishes are derived from domestic animals such as sheep and pigs
