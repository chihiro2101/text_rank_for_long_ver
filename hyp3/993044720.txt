because it is so readily made by heating limestone , lime must have been known from the earliest times , and all the early civilizations used it in building mortars and as a stabilizer in mud renders and floors because land transportation of minerals like limestone and coal was difficult in the pre-industrial era , they were distributed by sea , and lime was most often manufactured at small coastal ports permanent lime kilns fall into two broad categories : '' flare kilns '' also known as '' intermittent '' or '' periodic '' kilns ; and '' draw kilns '' also known as '' perpetual '' or '' running '' kilns the common feature of early kilns was an egg-cup shaped burning chamber , with an air inlet at the base ( the '' eye '' ) , constructed of brick successive dome-shaped layers of limestone and wood or coal were built up in the kiln on grate bars across the eye when loading was complete , the kiln was kindled at the bottom , and the fire gradually spread upwards through the charge this also limited the size of kilns and explains why kilns were all much the same size because there were large temperature differences between the center of the charge and the material close to the wall , a mixture of underburned ( i.e high loss on ignition ) , well-burned and dead-burned lime was normally produced lime production was sometimes carried out on an industrial scale the theoretical heat ( the standard enthalpy ) of reaction required to make high-calcium lime is around 3.15 mj per kg of lime , so the batch kilns were only around 20 % efficient as with batch kilns , only large , graded stone can be used , in order to ensure uniform gas-flows through the charge due to temperature peak at the burners up to 1200 & nbsp ; °c in a shaft kiln conditions are ideal to produce medium and hard burned lime first , when shaft a is the '' primary '' and b the '' secondary '' shaft , the combustion air is added from the top of shaft a , while fuel somewhat below via burner lances at same time in both shafts cooling air is added from the bottom to cool the lime and to make exhaust of gases via the bottom of the kiln impossible via maintaining always a positive pressure the cycling produces a long burning zone of constant , relatively low temperature ( around 950 & nbsp ; °c ) that is ideal for the production of high quality soft burned reactive lime fuel consumption is in 4 to 4.5 mj/kg range and the lime is typically medium burned rotary kilns started to be used for lime manufacture at the start of the 20th century and now account for a large proportion of new installations if energy costs are less important the early use of simple rotary kilns had the advantages that a much wider range of limestone size could be used , from fines upwards , and undesirable elements such as sulfur can be removed modern installations partially overcome this disadvantage by adding a preheater , which has the same good solids/gas contact as a shaft kiln , but fuel consumption is still somewhat higher , typically in range of 4.5 to 6 mj/kg the rotary kiln is the most flexible of any lime kilns able to produce soft , medium , or hard burned as well as dead-burned lime or dolime if the heat supplied to form the lime ( 3.75 mj/kg in an efficient kiln ) is obtained by burning fossil fuel it will release co 2 : in the case of coal fuel 295 & nbsp ; kg/t ; in the case of natural gas fuel 206 & nbsp ; kg/t thus , total emission may be around 1 tonne of co 2 for every tonne of lime even in efficient industrial plants , but is typically 1.3 t/t
