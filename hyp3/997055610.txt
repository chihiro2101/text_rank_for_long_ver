it used two telegraph type keys on the telephone , which had to be tapped the correct number of times to step the switch , but the use of separate keys with separate conductors to the exchange was not practical for a commercial system the stepping motion is controlled by the current pulses coming from the originating customer 's telegraph keys , and later from the rotary dial the original final selector ( connector ) switch which connected to 100 customers was supplemented by preceding group selector stages , as the '' cascading '' enabled connection to many more customers , and to customers at other exchanges another requirement for commercial systems was a circuit to detect a busy connection ( line ) and return a busy signal to the calling subscriber instead of dedicating an expensive first-stage selector switch to each customer as in the first exchange , the customer was given access to the first-stage switch of a telephone network , often by a line-finder which searches '' backward '' for the calling line ; so requiring only a few relays ( in most cases two , a line , and a cut-off relay ) , for the equipment required for each customer line later strowger ( sxs ) exchanges often use a subscriber uniselector as part of the line equipment individual to each line , which searches '' forward '' for a first selector this is more economical for higher calling-rate domestic or business customers , and has the advantage that access to additional switches can readily be added if the traffic increases ( the number of linefinders serving a group is limited by the wiring multiple installed ) previous systems had all been designed for a fixed number of subscribers to be switched directly to each other in a mesh arrangement the selection of switching systems for london and other large cities was not decided until the 1920s , when the director telephone system was adopted the director systems used sxs switches for destination routing and number translation facilities similar to the register used in common-control exchanges
