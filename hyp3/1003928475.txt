the starter weight is usually 13 % to 25 % of the total flour weight , though formulas may vary because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker 's yeasts , sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine this may be convenient for single loaf production , but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread can not be achieved in a bread making machine , as this usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam sourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water broadly speaking , the yeast produces gas ( carbon dioxide ) which leavens the dough , and the lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid , which contributes flavor in the form of sourness during sourdough fermentation , many cereal enzymes , particularly phytases , proteases and pentosanases , are activated through acidification and contribute to biochemical changes during sourdough fermentation type i sourdoughs are generally firm doughs , have a ph range of 3.8 to 4.5 , and are fermented in a temperature range of '' yeasts have the ability to free fructose from glucofructans which compose about 1–2 % of the dough if the fermenting dough gets too warm , the yeasts slow down , producing less fructose a belgian study of wheat and spelt doughs refreshed once every 24 hours and fermented at in a laboratory environment provides insight into the three-phase evolution of first-generation-to-stable sourdough ecosystems sanfranciscensis has typically not been identified in spontaneous sourdoughs , even after multiple cycles of back-slopping ; it was rapidly introduced in wheat sourdoughs , however , when plant materials were used to start the fermentation they have a ph less than 3.5 , and are fermented within a temperature range of for several days without feedings , which reduces the flora 's activity they are pumpable and used in continuous bread production systems '' the drying conditions , time and heat applied , may be varied in order to influence caramelize and produce desired characteristics in the baked product there are many breads that use techniques similar to that used in the making of sourdough bread german pumpernickel is traditionally made from a sourdough starter , although modern pumpernickel loaves often use commercial yeasts , sometimes spiked with citric acid or lactic acid to inactivate the amylases in the rye flour sourdough fermentation and lactic acid bacteria may be useful to improve the quality of gluten-free breads , such as by enhancing texture , aroma , and shelf life , which can be extended by inhibition of mycotoxins associated with fungus list of microorganisms found in sourdough salt-rising bread żurek , polish soup made with rye flour soured in the same process that occurs in the forming of sourdough injera
