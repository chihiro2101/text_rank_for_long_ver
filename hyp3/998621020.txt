seafarers of the viking age may have known bear island , but the documented history begins in 1596 , when willem barents sighted the island on his third expedition starting in the early 17th & nbsp ; century , the island was used mainly as a base for the hunting of walrus and other species of seals the remnants of a whaling station from the early 20th century can be seen at kvalrossbukta ( '' walrus bay '' ) in the southeast since the shipping routes from the atlantic ocean to and the ports of the arctic white sea pass through the barents sea , the waters near bear island were of some strategic importance during world war ii as well during as the cold war in 2002 a nature reserve was established that covers all of the island , except around the meteorological station the reserve also includes the adjacent waters of a four nautical mile radius from the coast in 2008 , the decision was made to extend the reserve to a radius of from the coast covering on land and of sea area the southern part of bjørnøya is mountainous , the highest top being miseryfjellet on the southeast coast at about above sea level the northern part of the island forms a lowland plain that covers some two thirds of the surface area a number of anchorages and landing points exist , as well as a small harbor at herwighamna on the north coast water depths near the island and to the north and east do not much exceed , but become much greater to the south , and especially some to the west , where the continental shelf slopes into the deep water of the norwegian sea and greenland sea a branch of the north atlantic current carries warm water to svalbard , creating a climate much warmer than that of other regions at similar latitude because bear island lies on a boundary between cold water of polar origin and warmer atlantic water , water temperatures within a few dozen nautical miles of the island are quite variable , sometimes reaching in summer during the winter fast ice develops on the coast , but it is rare on the open sea around bear island the barents sea carries pack ice to bjørnøya every winter , sometimes as early as october , but a significant amount of ice is not common before february despite its name , bear island is not a permanent residence of polar bears , although many arrive with the expanding pack ice in the winter exploration in the barents sea and the recent development of the snøhvit gas field off the northern coast of norway shows that the ecologically sensitive polar and subpolar sea areas of the norwegian and barents sea have come into the focus of the petrol and gas industry publications of administrative and general interest are issued by the governor of svalbard maps , research reports , and scholarly works about svalbard-related subjects are available from the norwegian polar institute books bear island : the story of an isolated arctic island – exploration , people , culture and nature by dag kjelldahl general information website of the meteorological station on bear island report to the storting ( 1999–2000 ) on svalbard by the norwegian ministry of justice and the police – extensive report on political , administrative , economical and scientific matters relating to svalbard time zone timegenie.com – central europe time zone standard time difference compared to utc/gmt is +1 hours maps and photos : bear island nature reserve ( jpeg image ) – from the office of the governor of svalbard an interactive map of svalbard – bear island included detailed map northeastern part ( pdf ) showing the location of the meteorological station near the top detailed map southern part ( pdf ) map showing the location of bear island in relation to svalbard – from the norwegian polar institute strategic arctic outpost – pictorial introduction to bear island , from norwegian newspaper aftenposten , september 6 , 2005 geography , hydrography , meteorology : geology of bear island , norway – by dr taaget station , bjørnøya recent events : two russian vessels arrested at bear island for violation of fishing regulations
