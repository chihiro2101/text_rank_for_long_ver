) radio ( knx-rf ) ip ( also referred to as eibnet/ip or knxnet/ip ) knx is not based on a specific hardware platform and a network can be controlled by anything from an 8-bit microcontroller to a pc , according to the demands of a particular building the current vendor list can be found at knx.org : this is a royalty-free open standard and thus access to the knx specifications is unrestricted many actuators include controller functionality , but also sensor functionality ( for instance measuring operating hours , number of switch cycles , current , electrical power consumption , and more ) application software , together with system topology and commissioning software , is loaded onto the devices via a system interface component the key features of the knx architecture are : interworking and distributed application models for the building automation various tasks ; schemes for configuration and management of resources on the network , and to permit the binding of parts of a distributed application in different nodes ; a communication system with a message protocol and models for the communication stack in each node ( capable of hosting distributed applications ( knx common kernel ) ; and models for the realization of these elements when developing actual devices to be mounted and linked in an installation to logically link applications datapoints across the network , knx has three underlying binding schemes : one for free , one for structured and one for tagged binding : in free binding , links between datapoints are not prescribed - in combination with free addressing , this supports customized multicast grouping at the level of individual datapoints and is central to s-mode configuration ( see below ) ; in structured binding , the knx specification stipulates a precise pattern for linking a whole set of datapoints , usually corresponding to a functional block or channel ( push-button modes follow this concept ) ; tagged binding is also pre-structured by the application models , but the numerical value of address is part of its value the common kernel sits on top of the physical layers and the medium-specific data link layer and is shared by all the devices on the knx network it is osi 7-layer model compliant : a general data link layer , which sits above the specific data link layers for each medium , provides access control and the logical link control ; a network layer ( for nodes with routing functionality ) provides a segment-wise acknowledged telegram ( frame ) and controls the hop count of a frame ; a transport layer enables four types of communication : one-to-many connectionless ( multicast ) , one-to-all connectionless ( broadcast ) , one-to-one connectionless , one-to-one connection-oriented ; ( osi session and presentation layers are empty ) ; and an application layer offers a toolkit of services to the application process configuration may be achieved through a combination of local activity on the devices ( such pushing a button ) , and active network management communication over the bus ( peer-to-peer , or more centralized master-slave ) there are three categories of knx devices : a-mode or '' automatic mode '' devices which can configure themselves , and are able to be installed by the end user ; e-mode or '' easy mode '' devices that require basic training to install : their behaviour is pre-programmed , but configuration parameters need to be tailored to the user 's requirements ; or s-mode or '' system mode '' devices that can be used to create sophisticated building automation systems : they have no default behaviour , and must be programmed and installed by specialists knx encompasses tools for project engineering tasks such as linking a series of individual devices into a functioning installation and integrating different media and configuration modes device models vary according to node roles , capabilities , management features and configuration modes , and are all laid down in the profiles devices may be identified and subsequently accessed throughout the network either by their individual address , or by their unique serial number , depending on the configuration mode ) coupling units allow address filtering which helps to improve performance given the limited bus signal speed a deprecated specification , tp0 , running at a slower signalling speed of , has been retained from the batibus standard but knx products can not exchange information with batibus devices
