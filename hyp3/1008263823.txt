left untreated , ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body , including the heart , are starved of oxygen , and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli prior to cardiac arrest , patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine v-fib in the hope that it can be reverted to a cardiac rhythm compatible with life , whereas others will deliver cpr and sometimes drugs as described in the advanced cardiac life support protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation a more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a '' turbulent , disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded electrocardiogramic deflections continuously change in shape , magnitude and direction '' ventricular fibrillation most commonly occurs within diseased hearts , and , in the vast majority of cases , is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease in the brugada syndrome , changes may be found in the resting ecg with evidence of right bundle branch block ( rbbb ) and st elevation in the chest leads v1-v3 , with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death investigators are exploring new techniques of detecting and understanding the underlying mechanisms of sudden cardiac death in these patients without pathological evidence of underlying heart disease familial conditions that predispose individuals to developing ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death are often the result of gene mutations that affect cellular transmembrane ion channels most myocardial cells with an associated increased propensity to arrhythmia development have an associated loss of membrane potential in conditions such as myocardial ischaemia , possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal k + concentration , the increased external k + concentration , norepinephrine release and acidosis with ik1 suppressed , an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of funny current even in myocardial cells ( which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents ) factors that promote re-entry would include a slow-propagation velocity , a short refractory period with a sufficient size of ring of conduction tissue in clinical practice , therefore , factors that would lead to the right conditions to favour such re-entry mechanisms include increased heart size through hypertrophy or dilatation , drugs which alter the length of the refractory period and areas of cardiac disease defibrillation is the definitive treatment of ventricular fibrillation , whereby an electrical current is applied to the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles , with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for coordinated contractions to occur again some advanced life support algorithms advocate its use once and only in the case of witnessed and monitored v-fib arrests as the likelihood of it successfully cardioversion a patient are small and this diminishes quickly in the first minute of onset people who survive a '' v-fib arrest '' and who make a good recovery are often considered for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator , which can quickly deliver this same life-saving defibrillation should another episode of ventricular fibrillation occur outside a hospital environment subsequent to this in 1850 , fibrillation was described by ludwig and hoffa when they demonstrated the provocation of ventricular fibrillation in an animal by applying a '' faradic '' ( electrical ) current to the heart his description is as follows : '' the ventricular muscle is thrown into a state of irregular arrhythmic contraction , whilst there is a great fall in the arterial blood pressure , the ventricles become dilated with blood as the rapid quivering movement of their walls is insufficient to expel their contents ; the muscular action partakes of the nature of a rapid incoordinate twitching of the muscular tissue … the cardiac pump is thrown out of gear , and the last of its vital energy is dissipated in the violent and the prolonged turmoil of fruitless activity in the ventricular walls '' macwilliam spent many years working on ventricular fibrillation and was one of the first to show that ventricular fibrillation could be terminated by a series of induction shocks through the heart 1922 the re-entry mechanism was also advocated by deboer , who showed that ventricular fibrillation could be induced in late systole with a single shock to a frog heart katz ln 1928 this was called the “ vulnerable period ” by wiggers and wegria in 1940 , who brought to attention the concept of the danger of premature ventricular beats occurring on a t wave he described ventricular fibrillation as '' an incoordinate type of contraction which , despite a high metabolic rate of the myocardium , produces no useful beats as a result , the arterial pressure falls abruptly to very low levels , and death results within six to eight minutes from anemia ischemia of the brain and spinal cord ''
