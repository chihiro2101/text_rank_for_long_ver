natural gas began to be used only in 1930 wood gas vehicles : firewood in the fuel tank low-tech magazine , january 18 , 2010 wood gasifiers are still manufactured in china and russia for automobiles and as power generators for industrial applications on diesel engines the diesel fuel is still needed to ignite the gas mixture , so a mechanically regulated diesel engine 's '' stop '' linkage and probably '' throttle '' linkage must be modified to always give the engine a little bit of injected fuel , often under the standard idle per-injection volume in more recent times , wood gas has been suggested as a clean and efficient method to heat and cook in developing countries , or even to produce electricity when combined with an internal combustion engine based on long-term practical experiments and over driven with a wood gas-powered car , the energy consumption has been 1.54 times higher compared to the energy demand of the same car on petrol , excluding the energy needed to extract , transport and refine the oil from which petrol is derived , and excluding the energy to harvest , process , and transport the wood to feed the gasifier this study also considers all possible losses of the wood gas system , like preheating of the system and carrying of the extra weight of the gas-generating system in power generation , reported demand of fuel is wood combustible matter per kilowatt-hour of electricity a normal catalytic converter works well with wood gas , but even without it , emission levels less than 20 ppm hc and 0.2 % co can be easily achieved by most automobile engines combustion of wood gas generates no particulates , and the gas renders thus very little carbon black amongst motor oil most of the co produced by gasification is oxidized to in the secondary combustion cycle ; therefore , gasification stoves carry lower health risks than conventional cooking fires another application is the use of producer gas to displace light density fuel oil ( ldo ) in industrial furnaces green hydrogen gas is also extracted from the wood gas which is in turn produced from widely available and carbon neutral biomass depending on the intended use of the gas , tar can be beneficial , as well by increasing the heating value of the gas the heat of combustion of '' producer gas '' & nbsp ; — a term used in the united states meaning wood gas produced for use in a combustion engine & nbsp ; — is rather low compared to other fuels
