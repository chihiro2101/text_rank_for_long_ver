these groups appeared in the theory of quadratic forms : in the case of binary integral quadratic forms , as put into something like a final form by gauss , a composition law was defined on certain equivalence classes of forms the size of the ideal class group can be considered as a measure for the deviation of a ring from being a principal ideal domain ; a ring is a principal domain if and only if it has a trivial ideal class group the principal ideals form the ideal class r which serves as an identity element for this multiplication in general , such a j may not exist and consequently the set of ideal classes of r may only be a monoid however , if r is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field , or more generally a dedekind domain , the multiplication defined above turns the set of fractional ideal classes into an abelian group , the ideal class group of r the group property of existence of inverse elements follows easily from the fact that , in a dedekind domain , every non-zero ideal ( except r ) is a product of prime ideals the number of ideal classes ( the of r ) may be infinite in general but if r is in fact a ring of algebraic integers , then the class number is always finite computation of the class group is hard , in general ; it can be done by hand for the ring of integers in an algebraic number field of small discriminant , using minkowski 's bound the other part of the answer is provided by the multiplicative group of units of the dedekind domain , since passage from principal ideals to their generators requires the use of units ( and this is the rest of the reason for introducing the concept of fractional ideal , as well ) : define a map from r & times ; to the set of all nonzero fractional ideals of r by sending every element to the principal ( fractional ) ideal it generates a square root of & minus ; 1 ) , are all principal ideal domains ( and in fact are all euclidean domains ) , and so have class number 1 : that is , they have trivial ideal class groups for d 0 , the ideal class group may be half the size since the class group of integral binary quadratic forms is isomorphic to the narrow class group of q it does not possess unique factorization ; in fact the class group of r is cyclic of order 2 the hilbert class field l of a number field k is unique and has the following properties : every ideal of the ring of integers of k becomes principal in l , i.e
