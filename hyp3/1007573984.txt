in 2005 collingwood said , '' we decided early on , it ’ s better to not have arguments that some bands have where someone might say , ‘ i wrote 15 % of that song , ’ and try to figure out those numbers '' schlesinger added , '' we just agreed many years ago that if we were to have a band we ’ d just split the songwriting to avoid having a conversation every time we tried to finish a song collingwood , in particular , had a difficult time coping with the band being dropped by their label at the end of four years of the hardest work i ’ d ever done in my life , more traveling and being away from my wife the whole time , i had nothing to show for it in 2003 , the band released welcome interstate managers , a successful album that spawned the grammy-nominated riaa gold-certified hit single '' stacy 's mom '' , which adam schlesinger says was a tribute to the band , the cars ; initially , the single stalled at commercial alternative radio in the us , but mtv president judy mcgrath championed the single 's music video , a fast times at ridgemont high homage featuring rachel hunter another song off the album , '' all kinds of time '' , was used for nfl commercial promotions during the 2005 season in 2007 , the band released traffic and weather , an album which included the song '' i-95 '' , which rolling stone named 54 of the year 's top 100 songs also that year , they played a short run of full-band acoustic shows where they showcased songs from their forthcoming album also , on a sadder note that year , the store for which their band was named ( seen also in the sopranos episode , '' another toothpick '' ) went out of business according to porter , '' it ’ s a little bit more introspective and not as loud of a record as the last two i think that came from the fact that we started last year doing acoustic-based tours because we didn ’ t have a record out '' in 2011 , the band released sky full of holes , an album put out in japan by warner music japan ( with two bonus tracks ) , europe by lojinx , and the u.s the now-sober collingwood once again became more involved , but this turned out to be the hardest album for them to make at the time of the album release , he elaborated on fountains of wayne 's demise by saying , '' when we were recording the record before the last fountains of wayne record , which was called traffic and weather , i did n't really have a whole lot to contribute to that album and when i was ready to actually make another album , you know , several years later after i 'd sort of cleaned up my act , it was very difficult '' porter and young joined schlesinger in 2016 on the monkees ' album good times ! and again in 2018 on the group 's christmas party
