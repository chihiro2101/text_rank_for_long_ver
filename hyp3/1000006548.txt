they also enable organization of ecology and climate data , including ranges of animals and plants this wikiproject will create articles on all the terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions on earth using a consistent naming scheme link to these ecoregion articles when you need to describe broad-scale ecology two things need to be checked on these ecoregions : ( a ) do the ecoregion and main article subject really refer to the same area ? if not , a separate ecoregion article may be warranted ( b ) is there an 'ecoregion ' subsection in the main article ? if not , one should be added , so that basic information about the ecoregion can be noted : realm , biome , wwf id , area in km2 , whether it is a global200 ecoregion , a couple of sentences describing how the flora/fauna differ from bordering ecoregions , a characterization of the conservation status , and of course the reference links you can see which countries have missing or incomplete ecoregion articles and create or expand them , or create a missing country list for the wikidata page for each ecoregion , there should be complete coverage of some minimal data points : ecoregion name , realm , biome , countr ( ies ) , wwf id code , map , image , climate ( koppen ) , coordinates ( middle of the largest section ) similarly , it would be good to upgrade each of the biome articles to '' b '' status , as they are the base for a lot of common information when an article for a country , protected area , mountain range , water body , etc should also refer to ecoregions when describing their range create missing ecoregion maps one way to identify source data for maps is to look at the source information on the wikicommons page for a nearby ecoregion map we should use the world reference base for soil resources ( wrb ) ( external link ) , as it is a worldwide soil classification system , widely accepted and translated in many languages issue 1 : the main map is '' fair use '' : could we ask for it , might we just put a link to it ? issue 2 : the main map is not precise enough to easily find references of soil types for each ecoregion a major difference with usda soil taxonomy is that soil-related climate regimes , such as xeric , ustic , and udic , are not part of the system , except insofar as climate influences soil profile characteristics ( see climate ) when claiming that a country , state , landform , or protected area is in a wwf ecoregion , you can copy-paste the following citation to the original paper : it will appear as follows : ecoregion statistics add the template to all ecoregion articles and fill out as many fields as possible ecoregion articles should use the names given them by their defining organizations ( wwf , epa , cec , etc ) an ecoregion article will typically contain the following sections : an account of major plant communities or habitat types , including their structure and predominant or characteristic species an account of the history of human activity in the ecoregion local and global agents affecting the ecoregion 's ecology , including : protected and natural areas project members should assess articles according to the importance and quality scales given at wikipedia : wikiproject ecoregions/assessment , and then record the results using the project template on the article talk page user:1brettsnyder - i have created several ecoregion articles and will continue to do so , as well as improve any and all ecoregion articles i find lacking user : every-leaf-that-trembles ( 2018 ) - writing wwf ecoregion articles , also filling out the wikidata items jarrahtree ( 2019 ) - adding for the processes interconnected with biota in oceania j-mo 19:49 , 13 september 2020 ( utc ) user : joe roe , interested in arid ecosystems in western asia miguel.v will work on ecoregion articles as i look them up and find them lacking
