some chaperone systems work as foldase : they support the folding of proteins in an atp-dependent manner ( for example , the groel/groes or the dnak/dnaj/grpe system ) other chaperones work as holdase : they bind folding intermediates to prevent their aggregation , for example dnaj or hsp33 some chaperones can assist in protein degradation , leading proteins to protease systems , such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes however , crowding can reduce the yield of correctly folded protein by increasing protein aggregation new functions for chaperones continue to be discovered , such as bacterial adhesin activity , induction of aggregation towards non-amyloid aggregates , suppression of toxic protein oligomers via their clustering , and in responding to diseases linked to protein aggregation ( e.g chaperones are found in , for example , the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , since protein synthesis often occurs in this area it has been noted that increased expression of hsp70 proteins in the cell results in a decreased tendency toward apoptosis its molecular weight is about 90 kda , and it is necessary for viability in eukaryotes ( possibly for prokaryotes as well ) heat shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) is a molecular chaperone essential for activating many signaling proteins in the eukaryotic cell originally thought to clamp onto their substrate protein ( also known as a client protein ) upon binding atp , the recently published structures by vaughan et al indicate that client proteins may bind externally to both the n-terminal and middle domains of hsp90 these proteins are thought to function as chaperones by processively threading client proteins through a small 20 Ã¥ ( 2 nm ) pore , thereby giving each client protein a second chance to fold the genes of escherichia virus t4 that encode proteins with a role in determining phage t4 structure were identified using conditional lethal mutants doi:10.1038/scientificamerican0265-70 most of these proteins proved to be either major or minor structural components of the completed phage particle dominance interactions in escherichia coli cells mixedly infected with bacteriophage t4d wild-type and amber mutants and their possible implications as to type of gene-product function : catalytic vs doi:10.2217/fmb.14.91 with regard to head morphogenesis , chaperone gp31 interacts with the bacterial host chaperone groel to promote proper folding of the major head capsid protein gp23 gp4 ( 50 ) ( 65 ) , although not specifically listed as a chaperone , acts catalytically as a nuclease that appears to be essential for morphogenesis by cleaving packaged dna to enable the joining of heads to tails synthesis of the long tail fibers depends on the chaperone protein gp57a that is needed for the trimerization of gp34 and gp37 , the major structural proteins of the tail fibers the term '' molecular chaperone '' appeared first in the literature in 1978 , and was invented by ron laskey to describe the ability of a nuclear protein called nucleoplasmin to prevent the aggregation of folded histone proteins with dna during the assembly of nucleosomes
