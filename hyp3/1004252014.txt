in 2011 , a severe long drought had hit the coastal districts lughaya , zeila districts for the last three years and affected the livelihood of pastoralists in these areas despite the vast marine resources available , as indicated in somaliland national development plan , fishing plays a very limited role in the economy of coastal towns first the demand for fish consumption is very low in the coastal towns due to limited population densities , and as result of this , a very small number of artisan fishermen are engaged in subsistence type of fishing and use small boats just to feed their families and meet the available market second , the coastal towns have no easy access to major urban centers where demand for fish consumption is high these topographical features of both zones severely discourage truck owners and , as a result , cause very high transportation charges and long travel duration together , the sandy coastal plains and mountainous features make market accessibility almost impossible of transporting fish from coastal towns to major urban centers since most of somaliland 's major urban centers are in ogo zone which occurs south of both of coastal and mountainous zones third , large scale of fishing is hampered by absence of constant ice-making and fish storage facilities ; lack of organization and skills in repairing and maintenance services of fishing boats and fishing gear ; high fuel costs ; and above all lack of freezer trucks to transport fish to major urban centers where demand for fish is very high finally , the sector is constrained by the absence of institutional capacity including ice-making and fish storage facilities in coastal towns p.50 the numbers and the scope businesses enterprises have spread dramatically like a bush fire manufacturing industries is very limited and mostly depend on imported raw materials according to their capital base , enterprises in the region can roughly be divided into three main categories or levels : low , medium , and upper the low capital level categories include petty trading activities solely established to generate daily subsistence for their owner-managers and are not in the real sense of the word profit-oriented their capital base varies from less than a hundred dollar to several hundred us dollars and can be classified as survival businesses the upper-level enterprises have more capital base than the other two levels they are a few in numbers and are involved in either service sector such as remittance , merchandising , import-export trading , or run small scale manufacturing industries all three levels provide different types of employment opportunities from self-employment to paid jobs and enabled the public to have easy access to essential goods and services second , lack proximate port facilities in the coastal towns of lughaya and zeila cause high transportation cost of imported commodities finally , the institutional capacity of the sector to provide necessary technical support services is missing the mining sector is the least developed in the region some areas of this zone adjacent to coastal areas also get some of winter ( hais ) rains received by the coastal zone the zone is also characterized by the existence of many dry rivers with running water streams throughout the year as population density has increased and economic conditions become harsh , people turned to natural resources such as forests for a living moreover , the socialist regime of siyad barre has introduced cooperative farming practices , and , as a result , many common grazing lands and valleys and that were the breeding environment of wildlife , were given to specific people in the name of farming cooperatives afterwards , an unprecedented land grabbing started in rural areas roads are very crucial for the movement of people and goods besides , the distance between zeila and borama is about 250 & nbsp ; km and it takes about 8 hours for a truck to travel between the two towns due to the poor condition of the road the coastal and mountainous zones are indeed economically very potential but are the least developed so far according to the chinese proverb , poverty can be easily reduced through building roads : if you want fight poverty build a road when roads are opened to impoverished isolated communities life could dramatically improve p.64 housing and transport has had the mandate of providing guidance and oversight over public works , transport , and housing in all districts of the region the head office of the sector in the region has neither the capacity nor the resources required for the restoration of sector operations there are only 10 staff people in the region including a security guard at the present , and they share two available offices like other regions , charcoal and fire woods are the main fuel sources utilized for household , businesses and other institutions that are involved in food services in the region charcoal consumption is the highest in the urban centers while firewood is mainly used in rural areas and , as result of this , electricity is only used for lighting households and for minor commercial operations purposes the purpose the airport was built was to enable the region to have an access to air transport for the movement of goods and people and link the region to the outside world additionally , the airport is missing some very essential services and facilities such weather forecasting services , fire trucks , air communication and water supply system the regional head office of the posts and telecommunication sector is in very bad shape and could not be restored the post office was built during the colonial administration with mud bricks and was mainly used for postal services the head of the sector in region described as the '' home of bats and rats '' even the land surrounding the post office , including its front compound are taken and built by intruders currently , the total employees of the sector in the region are 7 the sector challenges are not specific to the region with the exception of office premises what is missing and urgent is the establishment of office premises in all districts of the regions ease of access to reliable water sources is important in summer for both people and livestock as a result of this , the only reliable water sources in the coastal zones are strategically placed bore wells both for human and livestock consumption kalowle bore well provides water to pastoralists and lughaya town which is about 8 & nbsp ; km from the bore well site these bore wells are strategic in the sense that they are drilled in the driest areas of the coastal zone , where water sources are not obtainable since zeila occurs in the coastal zone , it is very hot during the summer season and life is difficult without adequate water supply besides , zeila is the entry point of people and goods coming from republic djibouti and , as a result of this , there is a customs office where the ministry of finance collects import taxes from goods entering the country accordingly , the provision of sufficient and drinkable water supply is very crucial for lives of town people and for the movement of people between somaliland and republic of djibouti unlike the other zones of the region , the mountainous zone has reliable water sources in the region an exception are five communal balleys dug by a world bank project in the 1980s in three sites around borama , which have not been de-silted since excavation different water prices are charged by the operators on the different bore wells in coastal areas unlike the strategic bore wells in the coastal zone , mini- water systems exist in the major towns and villages in mountainous zone mini water systems are for human consumption and funded by international organizations with the collaboration of local communities and local governments it is primarily inhabited by the three sub-clans of the gadabursi clan , whose traditional institutions survived the colonial period , somali statehood and the war in good shape , remaining functionally intact and highly relevant to public security
