the construction of fortifications in the surrounding hills had been planned as early as 1837 , but at the time of the battle only basic facilities and roadways had been completed on the north side of the long , westward-facing bay although it is known that the tower was built some time before the start of the war , the historical records do not show exactly when this occurred , and no mention of this is made in the contemporary descriptions of the siege itself what is known is that the tower was originally built or expanded by sevastopol merchants and then later taken over by the russian navy yet early in october 1854 , sevastopol was not the towering fortress it later became , and totleben himself maintained that had the allies assaulted it immediately , they would have succeeded in taking the city there were , however , many reasons against them doing so at the time , and it was not until 17 october that the first attack took place the advancing fleet engaging the harbour batteries also suffered a loss of 500 men and several ships were heavily damaged still , british siege batteries managed to silence the malakoff and its annexes , after having succeeded in hitting a munitions depot and , if failure had not occurred at the other points of attack , an assault might have succeeded gorchakov and the field army were to make another attack at the chernaya , the first since the inkerman the battle of the great redan was initially successful , but a russian counterattack drove the british out of the bastion after two hours after the french attacks on the flagstaff bastion ( left of the great redan ) were repelled that night the russians fled over the bridges to the north side , and on 9 september the victors took possession of the empty and burning city as the fortress enabled the control of the black sea port of sevastopol , the russian forces destroyed all of their equipment and withdrew , leaving russia with no more military fortifications on the black sea the hasty nature , too , of the fortifications , which were damaged every day during the siege by the fire of a thousand guns , and had to be rebuilt every night , required large , unprotected working parties and the losses amongst these were correspondingly heavy these losses exhausted russia 's resources and when they were forced to employ large bodies of militia in the battle of the chernaya , it was obvious that the end was at hand as a result of press coverage of the siege of the tower , malakhov kurgan became a household name in europe and many large and expensive towers in western europe were named after it
