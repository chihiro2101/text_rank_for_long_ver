nuclear terrorism , according to a 2011 report published by the belfer center for science and international affairs at harvard university , can be executed and distinguished via four pathways : the use of a nuclear weapon that has been stolen or purchased on the black market the use of a crude explosive device built by terrorists or by nuclear scientists who the terrorist organization has furtively recruited the use of an explosive device constructed by terrorists and their accomplices using their own fissile material the acquisition of fissile material from a nation-state the creation of a device that may give information about the configuration of components needed for a nuclear weapon former u.s as early as december 1945 , politicians worried about the possibility of smuggling nuclear weapons into the united states , though this was still in the context of a battle between the superpowers of the cold war until that time , no one in the united states government had thought seriously about the menace of organized , international terrorism , much less nuclear terrorism there was a perception in washington that the value of what is called 'special nuclear material ' - plutonium or highly enriched uranium ( heu ) - was so enormous that the strict financial accountability of the private contractors who dealt with it would be enough to protect it from falling into the wrong hands in 1986 a private panel of experts known as the international task force on the prevention of terrorism released a report urging all nuclear-armed states to beware the dangers of terrorism and work on equipping their nuclear arsenals with permissive action links and there is concern about the possible detonation of a small , crude nuclear weapon by a militant group in a major city , with significant loss of life and property al-qaeda has sought nuclear weapons for almost two decades by attempting to purchase stolen nuclear material and weapons and has sought nuclear expertise on numerous occasions although the chances of them obtaining a nuclear bomb are small , the group have been trying/suspected of trying to obtain a nuclear dirty bomb international atomic energy agency spokeswoman gill tudor said that the seized materials were '' low grade and would not present a significant safety , security or nuclear proliferation risk '' in november 2006 , mi5 warned that al-qaida were planning on using nuclear weapons against cities in the united kingdom by obtaining the bombs via clandestine means there have been incidents where individuals such as david hahn ( a former boy scout known for trying to build a nuclear reactor ) and others have been initially charged under the relevant legislation due to the extent of contamination but the charges later withdrawn either due to lack of evidence or other reasons in january 2010 , it was revealed that the us army was training a specialised unit '' to seal off and snatch back '' pakistani nuclear weapons in the event that militants would obtain a nuclear device or materials that could make one a study by the belfer center for science and international affairs at harvard university titled '' securing the bomb 2010 , '' found that pakistan 's stockpile '' faces a greater threat from islamic terror groups seeking nuclear weapons than any other nuclear stockpile on earth stewart said that pakistan '' continues to take steps to improve its nuclear security , and is aware of the threat presented by extremists to its program '' '' could terrorists get hold of a nuclear bomb ? , bbc , 2010-04-12 in 2015 , white house press secretary josh earnest said that the us has confidence that pakistan is '' well aware of the range of potential threats to its nuclear arsenal '' he added that the us is '' confident that pakistan has a professional and dedicated security force that understands the importance and the high priority that the world places on nuclear security '' nuclear weapons expert david albright and author of '' peddling peril '' has also expressed concerns that pakistan 's stockpile may not be secure despite assurances by both pakistan and u.s he stated that pakistan '' has had many leaks from its program of classified information and sensitive nuclear equipment , and so you have to worry that it could be acquired in pakistan '' official : terrorists seek nuclear material , but lack ability to use it , cnn , 2010-04-13 in 2015 , richard g a 2016 study by the congressional research service titled 'pakistan 's nuclear weapons ' , noted that pakistan 's '' initiatives , such as strengthened export control laws , improved personnel security , and international nuclear security cooperation programs , have improved pakistan 's nuclear security '' preventing a nuclear 9/11 : first , secure the highly enriched uranium the new york times , september 24 , 2004 in 2004 , bruce blair , president of the center for defense information stated : '' i would n't be at all surprised if nuclear weapons are used over the next 15 or 20 years , first and foremost by a terrorist group that gets its hands on a russian nuclear weapon or a pakistani nuclear weapon '' in 2006 , robert galluccii , dean of the school of foreign service , estimated that , “ it is more likely than not that al-qaeda or one of its affiliates will detonate a nuclear weapon in a u.s there is no credible evidence that any terrorist group has yet succeeded in obtaining a nuclear bomb or the materials needed to make one molander p 9 , retrieved march 11 , 2013 - this report uses smuggled nuclear weapons

believed to have been created by the united states and israel to attack iran 's nuclear facilities after 9/11 , nuclear power plants were to be prepared for an attack by a large , well-armed terrorist group the federation of american scientists have said that if nuclear power use is to expand significantly , nuclear facilities will have to be made extremely safe from attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity into the community the peace group plowshares have shown how nuclear weapons facilities can be penetrated , and the groups actions represent extraordinary breaches of security at nuclear weapons plants in the united states non-proliferation policy experts have questioned '' the use of private contractors to provide security at facilities that manufacture and store the government 's most dangerous military material '' however , the government 's response made clear the need for an agency capable of effectively responding to such threats in the future later that year , president ford created the nuclear emergency search team ( nest ) , which under the atomic energy act is tasked with investigating the '' illegal use of nuclear materials within the united states , including terrorist threats involving the use of special nuclear materials '' in august 2002 , the united states launched a program to track and secure enriched uranium from 24 soviet-style reactors in 16 countries , in order to reduce the risk of the materials falling into the hands of terrorists or '' rogue states '' '' the project has been hailed as '' a nonproliferation success story '' with the '' potential to inform broader 'global cleanout ' efforts to address one of the weakest links in the nuclear nonproliferation chain : insufficiently secured civilian nuclear research facilities gallucci believes that “ the united states should instead consider a policy of expanded deterrence , which focuses not on the would-be nuclear terrorists but on those states that may deliberately transfer or inadvertently lead nuclear weapons and materials to them “ the goal would be twofold : first , to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their own weapons ; second , to give every leader the incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials '' a decade of terrorism statistics show a strong correlation between attack fatalities and the attribution of the attack , and lieber and press assert that '' neither a terror group nor a state sponsor would remain anonymous after a nuclear terror attack lieber and press conclude that the lack of anonymity would deter a state from providing terrorist groups with nuclear weapons the use of heu and plutonium in satellites has raised the concern that a sufficiently motivated rogue state could retrieve materials from a satellite crash ( notably on land as occurred with kosmos 954 , mars 96 and fobos-grunt ) and then use these to supplement the yield of an already working nuclear device president obama , along with nearly fifty world leaders , discussed the threat of nuclear terrorism , what steps needed to be taken to mitigate illicit nuclear trafficking , and how to secure nuclear material however , world leaders at the summit failed to agree on baseline protections for weapons-usable material , and no agreement was reached on ending the use of highly enriched uranium ( heu ) in civil nuclear functions according to graham allison , director of harvard university ’ s belfer center for science and international affairs , the objectives of the nuclear security summit in seoul are to continue to , “ assess the progress made since the washington summit and propose additional cooperation measures to ( 1 ) combat the threat of nuclear terrorism , ( 2 ) protect nuclear materials and related facilities , and ( 3 ) prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials nuclear terrorism threat nuclear weapons & terrorist threats
