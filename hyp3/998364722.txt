according to the group freegan.info , '' after years of trying to boycott products from unethical corporations responsible for human rights violations , environmental destruction , and animal abuse , many of us found that no matter what we bought we ended up supporting something deplorable studies usually find that most people that participate in practices associated with freeganism , such as dumpster diving for food , do so for economic reasons freegans are usually distinguished as being a subset of this population which has an ideological or political motivation for recovering waste or avoiding consumption , although some freegans also say that they do so for amusement , to acquire free goods , or out of religious conviction freegans ' approach to anti-capitalism is broadly anarchism in orientation : rather than seeking to seize state power , freegans claim to be engaged in '' prefigurative politics '' , using wasted resources to build a new society '' in the shell of the old '' based on values of '' community , generosity , social concern , freedom , cooperation , and sharing '' for many , statistics about the ecological impacts of food waste—up to 12 % of global cropland and 23 % of global freshwater goes to produce food which is never consumed —serve as justification for a complete rejection of the capitalist food system although some freegans are reluctant to share their sites and strategies for '' urban foraging '' , others—like those in freegan.info—have organized public events to raise awareness of food waste and recruit other practitioners really , really free markets are free social events in which freegans can share goods instead of discarding them , share skills , give presents and eat food while research with freegans consistently shows that they endorse squatting , in practice , freegan living situations vary , ranging from trading work for rent to traditional home ownership some public health officials , like those in new york city , have explicitly discouraged dumpster diving for sanitation reasons and media coverage occasionally focuses on the '' ick '' factor of dumpster diving while ( explicitly or implicitly ) ignoring its political content the group freegan.info has made the disgust attached to wasted food part of its messaging , arguing that social disapprobation should instead fall on those who throw out food , rather than those who recover it a typical response is that freegan practices are not limited to dumpster diving , but include also actions like guerilla gardening , wild food foraging , or sewing or bike repair '' skill shares '' that are more fully autonomous from the conventional economy although activities like dumpster diving or gleaning are traditionally seen as subsistence strategies for the poor , most research on freegans finds that individuals come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds and have high levels of education ( even if their present lifestyles make them low-income ) freeganism has also been described as racially exclusive , because freeganism 's voluntary association of waste would seem to confirm a '' globally ubiquitous racial construction '' that people of color are dirty and polluted these actions could be seen as part of a broader criminalization of acts of survival—like sleeping in public places , sharing food without a permit , or recovering aluminum cans to re-sell—that has affected freegans as well as affiliated groups like food not bombs and the homeless more recently , freeganism has been discussed in the context of increasing public interest in food waste other analyses of the origins of contemporary public policy initiatives around food waste have also concluded that freeganism contributed to new initiatives , like the french law on food waste or the u.s
