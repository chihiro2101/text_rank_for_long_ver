according to the talmud , makkoth 23b is to be interpreted to mean that moses transmitted the torah from god to the israelites : '' moses commanded us the torah as an inheritance for the community of jacob '' the talmud notes that the hebrew numerical value ( gematria ) of the word torah is 611 , and combining moses 's 611 commandments with the first two of the ten commandments which were the only ones heard directly from god , adds up to 613 nahmanides , commentary to maimonides ' sefer hamitzvot , root principle 1 rabbi simeon ben zemah duran likewise rejected the dogma of the 613 as being the sum of the law , saying that '' perhaps the agreement that the number of mitzvot is 613 & nbsp ; 99 gersonides held that the number 613 was only one rabbi 's ( rabbi simlai 's ) opinion , and if the conclusion of a talmudic discussion indicated that the number of commandments was greater or lesser than 613 , rabbi simlai 's opinion would be overruled the vilna gaon suggested that there exist many more than 613 commandments ( because otherwise large narrative parts of the pentateuch would be without commandments , which he considered difficult to accept ) and that the count of 613 refers to '' roots '' ( shorashim ) of the other commandments see avraham of vilna , maalot hatorah ( printed in nachmanides , sefer haemunah vehabitachon , warsaw : 1877 , p.1 ) even when rabbis attempted to compile a list of the 613 commandments , they were faced with a number of difficulties : which statements were to be included amongst the 613 commandments ? every one of god 's commands to any individual or to the entire people of israel ? would an order from god be counted as a commandment , for the purposes of such a list , if it could only be complied with in one place and time ? else , would such an order only count as a commandment if it could be followed at all times ? ( the latter is the view of maimonides ) does counting a single commandment depend on whether it falls within one verse , even though it may contain multiple prohibitions , or should each prohibition count as a single commandment ? ultimately , though , the concept of 613 commandments has become accepted as normative amongst practicing jews and today it is still common practice to refer to the total system of commandments within the torah as the '' 613 commandments '' , even among those who do not literally accept this count as accurate in rabbinic literature , rishonim and later scholars composed to articulate and justify their enumeration of the commandments : halachot gedolot ( '' great laws '' ) , thought to be written by rabbi simeon kayyara ( the bahag ) is the earliest extant enumeration of the 613 mitzvot this work generally follows maimonides ' reckoning of the 613 commandments it is written in the order in which the commandments appear in the torah rather than an arrangement by category ( as in maimonides ' work ) in addition to enumerating the commandments and giving a brief overview of relevant laws , the sefer ha-chinuch also tries to explain the philosophical reasons behind the mitzvot the chafetz chaim 's work follows the reckoning of maimonides but gives only the commandments relevant today these 611 include the two commandments of , indicating that this list is incompatible with the approach of r ' hamnuna in the talmud ( who said that of the 613 commandments , the two in exodus 20:2 were given directly by god , and the remaining 611 via moses )
