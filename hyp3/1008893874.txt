gradually competitions became more codified such that by the 1950s the 10-bounce routine was the norm thereby paving the way for the first world championships which were organised by ted blake of nissen , and held in london in 1964 from that time until 2010 , european and world championships have taken place in alternate years—the european in the odd and the world in the even there is also a world cup circuit of international competitions which involves a number of competitions every year at first the americans were successful at world championship level , but soon european competitors began to dominate the sport and for a number of years , athletes from countries that made up the former soviet union have often dominated the sport since trampolining became an olympic sport , china has also made a very successful effort to develop world-class trampoline gymnasts , their first major success was in the 2007 men 's world championship and later in both men 's and women 's gold medals and a bronze in the 2008 olympic games held in beijing a double mini-trampoline competition consists of two types of pass these skills are similar to those performed on a regular trampoline except that there is forward movement along the trampoline the currently accepted basic format for individual trampoline competitions usually consists of two or three routines , one of which may involve a compulsory set of skills each routine consists of the athlete performing ten different skills starting and finishing on the feet in senior level competitions , a '' time of flight '' ( tof ) score was added to the overall score from 2010 this is now mainly in all competitions , including club , county and regional , as it is a key factor in judging in 2017 , the method of determining the horizontal displacement from the centre was changed , new markings were added to the bed and zones set up with deductions based on the distance from the centre of the trampoline bed they also have padded end decks , which are the locations that athletes are most likely to fall off the trampoline the rules for international competitions ( updated by fig in 2006 ) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each trampoline and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact of an athlete falling off the side of the trampoline bed the floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full ; for example in the uk the requirement for national & regional competition is still 2m but only of 20–25mm matting
