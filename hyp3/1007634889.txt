the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust , helping to keep it moving in the '' right '' direction as it exits the engine instead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell , an aerospike engine avoids this random distribution by firing along the outside edge of a wedge-shaped protrusion , the '' spike '' , which serves the same function as a traditional engine bell since the pressure in front of the vehicle is ambient , this means that the exhaust at the base of the spike nearly balances out with the drag experienced by the vehicle it gives no overall thrust , but this part of the nozzle also does n't lose thrust by forming a partial vacuum aerospikes work relatively poorly between mach 1–3 , where the airflow around the vehicle has reduced the pressure , thus reducing the thrust in theory this requires an infinitely long spike for best efficiency , but by blowing a small amount of gas out of the center of a shorter truncated spike ( like base bleed in an artillery shell ) , something similar can be achieved this design has the advantage of being stackable , allowing several smaller engines to be placed in a row to make one larger engine while augmenting steering performance with the use of individual engine throttle control after more development and considerable testing , this project was cancelled when the x-33 's composite fuel tanks repeatedly failed in the latest design , seven rs-2200s producing each would boost the venturestar into low earth orbit intended for the small satellite launch market , it is designed to launch satellites into low-earth orbit ( leo ) at a price of us 8–9 & nbsp ; million , much lower than with conventional launchers they later announced that their executor aerospike engine would produce of thrust at sea level and of thrust in a vacuum in june 2017 , arca announced that they would fly their demonstrator3 rocket to space , also using a linear aerospike engine this rocket was designed to test several components of their haas 2ca at lower cost
