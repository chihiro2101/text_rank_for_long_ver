dawn begins with the first sight of lightness in the morning , and continues until the sun breaks the horizon this morning twilight before sunrise is divided into three categories depending on the amount of sunlight that is present in the sky , which is determined by the angular distance of the centre of the sun ( degrees below the horizon ) in the morning nautical twilight begins when there is enough illumination for sailors to distinguish the horizon at sea but the sky is too dark to perform outdoor activities civil twilight begins when there is enough light for most objects to be distinguishable , so that some outdoor activities can commence between astronomical dawn and sunrise ) varies greatly depending on the observer 's latitude : from a little over 70 minutes at the equator , to many hours in the polar regions the period of twilight is shortest at the equator , where the equinox sun rises due east and sets due west , at a right angle to the horizon this can have a potential impact on the times and durations of dawn and dusk near the summer solstice , latitudes higher than 54°34 & prime ; get no darker than nautical twilight ; the '' darkness of the night '' varies greatly at these latitudes at latitudes higher than about 60°34 , summer nights get no darker than civil twilight this period of '' bright nights '' is longer at higher latitudes when the sun gets 9.0 to 9.5 degrees below the horizon ( at summer solstice this is at latitudes 57°30′–57°00′ ) , the zenith gets dark even on cloud-free nights ( if there is no full moon ) , and the brightest stars are clearly visible in a large majority of the sky
