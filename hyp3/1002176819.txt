parasympathetic nerve supply arises through three primary areas : certain cranial nerves in the cranium , namely the preganglionic parasympathetic nerves ( cn iii , cn vii , cn ix and cn x ) usually arise from specific nuclei in the central nervous system ( cns ) and synapse at one of four parasympathetic ganglia : ciliary , pterygopalatine , otic , or submandibular from these four ganglia the parasympathetic nerves complete their journey to target tissues via trigeminal branches ( ophthalmic nerve , maxillary nerve , mandibular nerve ) this differs from the sympathetic nervous system , where synapses between pre- and post-ganglionic efferent nerves in general occur at ganglia that are farther away from the target organ as in the sympathetic nervous system , efferent parasympathetic nerve signals are carried from the central nervous system to their targets by a system of two neurons the axons of presynaptic parasympathetic neurons are usually long , extending from the cns into a ganglion that is either very close to or embedded in their target organ as a result , the postsynaptic parasympathetic nerve fibers are very short the oculomotor nerve is responsible for a number of parasympathetic functions related to the eye the oculomotor pns fibers originate in the edinger-westphal nucleus in the central nervous system and travel through the superior orbital fissure to synapse in the ciliary ganglion located just behind the orbit ( eye ) the preganglionic fibers originate within the cns in the superior salivatory nucleus and leave as the intermediate nerve ( which some consider a separate cranial nerve altogether ) to connect with the facial nerve just distal ( further out ) to it surfacing the central nervous system just after the facial nerve geniculate ganglion ( general sensory ganglion ) in the temporal bone , the facial nerve gives off two separate parasympathetic nerves the vagus nerve , named after the latin word vagus ( because the nerve controls such a broad range of target tissues â€“ vagus in latin literally means '' wandering '' ) , has parasympathetic functions that originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the nucleus ambiguus in the cns the vagus nerve is an unusual cranial parasympathetic in that it does n't join the trigeminal nerve in order to get to its target tissues several parasympathetic nerves come off the vagus nerve as it enters the thorax another nerve that comes off the vagus nerves approximately at the level of entering the thorax are the cardiac nerves as the main vagus nerves continue into the thorax they become intimately linked with the esophagus and sympathetic nerves from the sympathetic trunks to form the esophageal plexus this is very efficient as the major function of the vagus nerve from there on will be control of the gut smooth muscles and glands unlike in the cranium , where one parasympathetic is in charge of one particular tissue or region , for the most part the pelvic splanchnics each contribute fibers to pelvic viscera by traveling to one or more plexuses before being dispersed to the target tissue there are other skeletal muscles involved with these processes but the parasympathetic plays a huge role in continence and bowel retention a study published in 2016 , suggests that all sacral autonomic output may be sympathetic ; indicating that the rectum , bladder and reproductive organs may only be innervated by the sympathetic nervous system assuming that the reported findings most likely applies to other mammals as well , this perspective suggests a simplified , bipartite architecture of the autonomic nervous system , in which the parasympathetic nervous system receives input from cranial nerves exclusively and the sympathetic nervous system from thoracic to sacral spinal nerves the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are the pain is also usually referred to dermatomes that are at the same spinal nerve level as the visceral afferent synapse the main mechanism by which the parasympathetic nervous system acts on vascular and cardiac control is the so-called vagal tone ( rsa ) at the same time , parasympathetics cause peristalsis of the urethral muscle , and the pudendal nerve causes contraction of the bulbospongiosus ( skeletal muscle is not via pn ) , to forcibly emit the semen the m2 muscarinic receptors are located in the heart , and act to bring the heart back to normal after the actions of the sympathetic nervous system : slowing down the heart rate , reducing contractile forces of the atrial cardiac muscle , and reducing conduction velocity of the sinoatrial node and atrioventricular node they have a minimal effect on the contractile forces of the ventricular muscle due to sparse innervation of the ventricles from the parasympathetic nervous system
