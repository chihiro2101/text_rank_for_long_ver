introduced to them as a new devotee , strepsiades begs them to make him the best orator in greece by a hundred miles he summons strepsiades outside and attempts further lessons , including a form of meditative incubation in which the old man lies under a blanket while thoughts are supposed to arise in his mind naturally superior argument sides with justice and the gods , offering to prepare pheidippides for an earnest life of discipline , typical of men who respect the old ways ; inferior argument , denying the existence of justice , offers to prepare him for a life of ease and pleasure , typical of men who know how to talk their way out of trouble at the end of the debate , a quick survey of the audience reveals that buggers – people schooled by inferior arguments – have got into the most powerful positions in athens the clouds represents a departure from the main themes of aristophanes ' early plays – athenian politics , the peloponnesian war and the need for peace with sparta thus the original production of the clouds in 423 bc came at a time when athens was looking forward to a period of peace aristophanes however had singled cleon out for special treatment in his previous play the knights in 424 and there are relatively few references to him in the clouds freed from political and war-time issues , aristophanes focuses in the clouds on a broader issue that underlies many conflicts depicted in his plays – the issue of old versus new , or the battle of ideas sommerstein , penguin classics 1973 , pages 16–17 the scientific speculations of ionian thinkers such as thales in the sixth century were becoming commonplace knowledge in aristophanes ' time and this had led , for instance , to a growing belief that civilized society was not a gift from the gods but rather had developed gradually from primitive man 's animal-like existence sommerstein , penguin classics 1973 , pages 108 he was forty-five years old and in good physical shape when the clouds was produced clouds ( 1970 ) , page xviii yet he had a face that lent itself easily to caricature by mask-makers , possibly a contributing reason for the frequent characterization of him by comic poets sommerstein , penguin classics 1975 , page 31 in fact one of the plays that defeated the clouds in 423 was called connus , written by ameipsias , and it too lampooned socrates sommerstein , penguin classics 1975 , page 16 there is a famous story , as reported for example by aelian , according to which socrates cheerfully rose from his seat during the performance of the clouds and stood in silent answer to the whispers among foreigners in the festival audience : '' who is socrates ? '' clouds ( 1970 ) , page xix there is some support for his opinion even in the modern age zuckert , university of chicago press 1996 , page 135 the practice of asceticism ( as for example idealized by the chorus in lines 412–19 ) , disciplined , introverted thinking ( as described by the chorus in lines 700–6 ) and conversational dialectic ( as described by socrates in lines 489–90 ) appear to be caricatures of socratic behaviours later described more sympathetically by plato clouds ( 1970 ) , pages xxii according to yet another view , the clouds can best be understood in relation to plato 's works , as evidence of a historic rivalry between poetic and philosophical modes of thought during the parabasis ( lines 518–62 ) , the chorus reveals that the original play was badly received when it was produced references in the same parabasis to a play by eupolis called maricas produced in 421 bce and criticism of the populist politician hyperbolus who was ostracized in 416 indicate that the second version of the clouds was probably composed somewhere between 421–16 bce since cleon died in 422 it can be assumed that this appeal was retained from the original production in 423 and thus the extant play must be a partial revision of the original play clouds ( 1970 ) , pages xxviii–xxix the revised play is an incomplete form of old comedy old comedy conventionally limits the number of actors to three or four , yet there are already three actors on stage when superior and inferior enter the action and there is no song at that point that would allow for a change of costume the play is unusually serious for an old comedy and possibly this was the reason why the original play failed at the city dionysia a typical aristophanic chorus , even if it starts out as hostile to the protagonist , is the protagonist 's cheer squad by the end of the play in the clouds however , the chorus appears sympathetic at first but emerges as a virtual antagonist by the end of the play the play adapts the following elements of old comedy in a variety of novel ways clouds ( 1970 ) , page 99 note 275–90 moreover , the majestic opening song is more typical of tragedy than comedy
