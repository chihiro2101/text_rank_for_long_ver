1 , the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray for example , if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron , and if there are 12 dynode stages , then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 5 12 ≈ 10 8 electrons the capacitors across the final few dynodes act as local reservoirs of charge to help maintain the voltage on the dynodes while electron avalanches propagate through the tube the side-on design is used , for instance , in the type 931 , the first mass-produced pmt besides the different photocathode materials , performance is also affected by the transmission of the window material that the light passes through , and by the arrangement of the dynodes significant for practical applications , elster and geitel two years later demonstrated the same effect using visible light striking alkali metals ( potassium and sodium ) the addition of caesium , another alkali metal , has permitted the range of sensitive wavelengths to be extended towards longer wavelengths in the red portion of the visible spectrum it is worthwhile to note that heinrich hertz , working 18 years earlier , had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency but independent of the optical intensity the phenomenon of secondary emission ( the ability of electrons in a vacuum tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an electrode ) was , at first , limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices ( which lacked photosensitivity ) harley iams and bernard salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain however , it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process , regardless of acceleration voltage at the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 ( very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity dynodes ) in the ussr , rca-manufactured radio equipment was introduced on a large scale by joseph stalin to construct broadcast networks , and the newly formed all-union scientific research institute for television was gearing up a research program in vacuum tubes that was advanced for its time and place '' the soviet device used a magnetic field to confine the secondary electrons and relied on the ag-o-cs photocathode which had been demonstrated by general electric in the 1920s whereas these early photomultipliers used the magnetic field principle , electrostatic photomultipliers ( with no magnetic field ) were demonstrated by jan rajchman of rca laboratories in princeton , nj in the late 1930s and became the standard for all future commercial photomultipliers the first mass-produced photomultiplier , the type 931 , was of this design and is still commercially produced today 20006 ( 1964 ) the philosophy included the idea that the product 's user need only be concerned about the response of the device rather than how the device may be fabricated various combinations of photocathode and window materials were assigned '' s-numbers '' ( spectral numbers ) ranging from s-1 through s-40 , which are still in use today in subsequent years other products were added , such as cathode ray tubes , photomultiplier tubes , motion-sensing light control switches , and closed-circuit television systems mcps are used for imaging and scientific applications , including night vision devices typically the materials have low work function and are therefore prone to thermionic emission , causing noise and dark current , especially the materials sensitive in infrared ; cooling the photocathode lowers this thermal noise connections to external circuits , hamamatsu ag-o-cs ( also called s1 ) transmission-mode , sensitive from 300–1200 & nbsp ; nm can be used for transmission-mode ; favorable response to a nai : tl scintillator flashes makes them widely used in gamma spectroscopy and radiation detection ; high-temperature bialkali ( na-k-sb ) , can operate up to 175 & nbsp ; °c , used in well logging , low dark current at room temperature ; multialkali ( na-k-sb-cs ) , ( also called s20 ) , wide spectral response from ultraviolet to near-infrared , special cathode processing can extend range to 930 & nbsp ; nm , used in broadband spectrophotometers ; solar-blind ( cs-te , cs-i ) , sensitive to vacuum-uv and ultraviolet , insensitive to visible light and infrared ( cs-te has cutoff at 320 & nbsp ; nm , cs-i at 200 & nbsp ; nm ) the windows of the photomultipliers act as wavelength filters ; this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range , but special care has to be taken for uncommon wavelengths high borate borosilicate glasses exist also in high uv transmission versions with high transmission also at 254 nm negative high-voltage supplies ( with the positive terminal grounded ) are often preferred , because this configuration enables the photocurrent to be measured at the low voltage side of the circuit for amplification by subsequent electronic circuits operating at low voltage the divider design , which influences frequency response or rise time , can be selected to suit varying applications some instruments that use photomultipliers have provisions to vary the anode voltage to control the gain of the system if used in a location with strong magnetic fields , which can curve electron paths , steer the electrons away from the dynodes and cause loss of gain , photomultipliers are usually magnetically shielded by a layer of soft iron or mu-metal photomultipliers were the first electric eye devices , being used to measure interruptions in beams of light this allows an instrument design that escapes the high-sensitivity applications , and which can therefore substantially increase the dynamic range of the instrument for example , blood analysis devices used by clinical medical laboratories , such as flow cytometry , utilize photomultipliers to determine the relative concentration of various components in blood samples , in combination with optical filters and incandescent lamps after 50 years , during which solid-state electronic components have largely displaced the vacuum tube , the photomultiplier remains a unique and important optoelectronic component perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts , electronically , as a nearly perfect current source , owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals the aforementioned refers to measurement of light fluxes that , while small , nonetheless amount to a continuous stream of multiple photons in geiger mode the photomultiplier gain is set so high ( using high voltage ) that a single photo-electron resulting from a single photon incident on the primary surface generates a very large current at the output circuit a photomultiplier will produce a small current even without incident photons ; this is called the dark current
