the concept of a world chess champion started to emerge in the first half of the 19th century , and the phrase '' world champion '' appeared in 1845 from then onwards various players were acclaimed as world champions , but the first contest that was defined in advance as being for the world championship was the match between wilhelm steinitz and johannes zukertort in 1886 however , in that year reigning champion kasparov and challenger short were so dissatisfied with fide 's arrangements for their match that they set up a breakaway organization '' the earliest recorded use of the term '' world champion '' was in 1845 , when howard staunton was described as '' the chess champion of england , or & nbsp ; '' the world 's great chess games '' , reuben fine , ( mckay , 1976 ) p.17 however , there is no evidence that he was widely acclaimed at the time as the world champion , although in 1893 henry bird retrospectively awarded the title to anderssen for his victory afterward morphy 's retirement from chess , anderssen was again regarded as the world 's strongest active player , a reputation he reinforced by winning the strong london 1862 chess tournament steinitz confirmed his standing as the world 's leading player by winning a match against johannes zukertort in 1872 ( 7-1 , 4 draws ) , winning the vienna 1873 chess tournament , and winning a match over joseph henry blackburne by a crushing 7-0 ( 0 draws ) in 1876 during that time , zukertort emerged as the world 's leading active player , winning the paris 1878 chess tournament zukertort then won the london 1883 chess tournament by a convincing 3-point margin , ahead of nearly every leading player in the world , with steinitz finishing second but later in his career , at least from 1887 , steinitz dated his reign from this 1866 match ; early uses of 'world chess champion ' , edward g some commentators date his time as world champion from 1866 ; others from 1886 following the steinitz-zukertort match , a tradition continued of the world championship being decided by a match between the reigning champion , and a challenger : if a player thought he was strong enough , he ( or his friends ) would find financial backing for a match purse and challenge the reigning world champion the tournament was duly played , but the outcome was not quite as planned : chigorin and max weiss tied for first place ; their play-off resulted in four draws ; and neither wanted to play a match against steinitz – chigorin had just lost to him , and weiss wanted to get back to his work for the rothschild bank lasker was the first champion after steinitz ; although he did not defend his title in 1897–1906 or 1911–1920 , he did string together an impressive run of tournament victories and dominated his opponents in 1911 he received a challenge for a world title match against josé raúl capablanca and , in addition to making severe financial demands , proposed some novel conditions : the match should be considered drawn if neither player finished with a two-game lead ; and it should have a maximum of 30 games , but finish if either player won six games and had a two-game lead ( previous matches had been won by the first to win a certain number of games , usually 10 ; in theory such a match might go on for ever ) further controversy arose when , in 1912 , lasker 's terms for a proposed match with akiba rubinstein included a clause that , if lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match , rubinstein should become world champion ( american chess bulletin , october 1913 ) when he resumed negotiations with capablanca after world war i , lasker insisted on a similar clause that if lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match , capablanca should become world champion capablanca argued that , if the champion abdicated , the title must go to the challenger as any other arrangement would be unfair to the challenger ( british chess magazine , october 1922 ) nonetheless lasker agreed to play a match against capablanca in 1921 , announcing that , if he won , he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it ( '' dr lasker and the championship '' in american chess bulletin , september–october 1920 )
