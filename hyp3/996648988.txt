retrieved 31 august 2011 one of the agents was '' garbo '' , a spanish double agent in lisbon , who gave his german handlers disinformation , by pretending to control a ring of agents all over england the film was never made , and greene soon realised that havana , which he had visited several times in the early 1950s , would be a much better setting , with the absurdities of the cold war being more appropriate for a comedy some of the names in his network are those of real people ( most of whom he has never met ) , but some are made up at one point , he decides to make his reports '' exciting '' by sending to london sketches of what he describes as a secret military installation in the mountains , actually vacuum cleaner parts scaled to a large size in london , nobody except hawthorne , the only one to know that wormold sells vacuum cleaners , doubts this report however , to his surprise , a real person with the same name is killed in an apparent car accident together , beatrice , who still believes the contacts to be real , and wormold try to save the real people who share names with his fictional agents meanwhile , london passes on the information that an unspecified enemy , implied to be a soviet contact , intends to poison wormold at a trade association luncheon , where he is the speaker captain segura , a military strongman in love with milly and intending to marry her , has a list of all of the spies in havana , which wormold would like to send to london to partially redeem his employment in his autobiography , ways of escape , greene commented : alas , the book did me little good with the new rulers in havana in poking fun at the british secret service , i had minimized the terror of batista 's rule i had not wanted too black a background for a light-hearted comedy , but those who suffered during the years of dictatorship could hardly be expected to appreciate that my real subject was the absurdity of the british agent and not the justice of a revolution
