it may be used to boost the orbit of the station once docked there were 42 spacecraft built using the initial progress design , the last one being launched in may 1990 it still featured the same launch shroud as the soyuz , though this was purely for aerodynamic purposes as the launch escape system had been deactivated the first 43 flights all went to mir ; following mir 's re-entry , progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the international space station the spacecraft belongs to the so-called 400 series ( grau : 11f615a60 ) , and all modifications applied to it were subsequently used in the production of new soyuz tma-01m crewed spacecraft progress m1 is another variant , capable of carrying more propellant ( but less total cargo ) to the space station progress m2 was a planned variant , which was a proposed design for the proposed mir-2 space station , but was dropped due to financial issues the m2 variant would have a larger service module for larger cargo or space station modules and would have been launched on a zenit rocket as the spacecraft is bigger it has the following improvements : new external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites progress spacecraft are used to resupply the international space station ( iss ) as of 2021 between 1 february 2003 and 26 july 2005 , they were the only spacecraft available to transport large quantities of supplies to the station , as the space shuttle fleet was grounded after the breakup of columbia at the end of sts-107 for iss missions , the progress m1 variant is used , which moves the water tanks from the propellant and refueling module to the pressurized section , and as a result is able to carry more propellant the european space agency ( esa ) operated its own type of robotic supply freighter , the automated transfer vehicle ( atv ) atvs can carry up to 8.85 tonnes of cargo into space , roughly three times as much as the progress , and were launched annually by ariane 5 rockets from 2011-2014 as part of esa contribution to iss upkeep nasa 's planned orion spacecraft was initially designed to have an uncrewed variant of the crew module similar to progress ; however , this capability was removed in 2009
