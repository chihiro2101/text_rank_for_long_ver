in a theoretical market with perfect information , substitute good , and no transaction costs or prohibition on secondary exchange ( or re-selling ) to prevent arbitrage , price discrimination can only be a feature of monopoly and oligopoly markets , ( '' price discrimination and imperfect competition '' , lars a however , product heterogeneity , market frictions or high fixed costs ( which make marginal-cost pricing unsustainable in the long run ) can allow for some degree of differential pricing to different consumers , even in fully competitive retail or industrial markets this usually entails using one or more means of preventing any resale : keeping the different price groups separate , making price comparisons difficult , or restricting pricing information price discrimination is thus very common in services where resale is not possible ; an example is student discounts at museums : in theory , students , for their condition as students , may get lower prices than the rest of the population for a certain product or service , and later will not become resellers , since what they received , may only be used or consumed by them exercising first degree ( or perfect or primary ) price discrimination requires the monopoly seller of a good or service to know the absolute maximum price ( or reservation price ) that every consumer is willing to pay by knowing the reservation price , the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price they are willing to pay , and thus transform the consumer surplus into revenues , leading it to be the most profitable form of price discrimination this allows the supplier to set different prices to the different groups and capture a larger portion of the total market surplus this is a way to differentiate consumers based on preference , and therefore allows the airline to capture more consumer 's surplus third degree price discrimination means charging a different price to different consumer groups ( some of these examples are not pure '' price discrimination '' , in that the differential price is related to production costs : the marginal cost of providing electricity or car parking spaces is very low outside peak hours thus a company may vary pricing by location , but then offer bulk discounts as well complete price discrimination is most profitable , and requires the seller to have the most information about buyers right the purpose of price discrimination is generally to capture the market 's consumer surplus this surplus arises because , in a market with a single clearing price , some customers ( the very low price elasticity segment ) would have been prepared to pay more than the single market price it can be argued that strictly , a consumer surplus need not exist , for example where fixed costs or economies of scale mean that the marginal cost of adding more consumers is less than the marginal profit from selling more product this means that charging some consumers less than an even share of costs can be beneficial an example is a high-speed internet connection shared by two consumers in a single building ; if one is willing to pay less than half the cost of connecting the building , and the other willing to make up the rest but not to pay the entire cost , then price discrimination can allow the purchase to take place note that the above requires both first and second degree price discrimination : the right segment corresponds partly to different people than the left segment , partly to the same people , willing to buy more if the product is cheaper it is also important to note that the marginal revenue in both markets at the optimal output levels must be equal , otherwise the firm could profit from transferring output over to whichever market is offering higher marginal revenue note that the price in a perfect competition market will always be lower than any price under price discrimination ( including in special cases like the internet connection example above , assuming that the perfectly competitive market allows consumers to pool their resources ) this is often done by assigning capacity to various booking classes , which sell for different prices and which may be linked to fare restrictions for example , schedule-sensitive business passengers who are willing to pay 300 for a seat from city a to city b can not purchase a 150 ticket because the 150 booking class contains a requirement for a saturday-night stay , or a 15-day advance purchase , or another fare rule that discourages , minimizes , or effectively prevents a sale to business passengers thus , making coupons available enables , for instance , breakfast cereal makers to charge higher prices to price-insensitive customers , while still making some profit off customers who are more price-sensitive for certain products , premium products are priced at a level ( compared to '' regular '' or '' economy '' products ) that is well beyond their marginal cost of production economists such as tim harford in the undercover economist have argued that this is a form of price discrimination : by providing a choice between a regular and premium product , consumers are being asked to reveal their degree of price sensitivity ( or willingness to pay ) for comparable products if , for example , potential business class customers will pay a large price differential only if economy class seats are uncomfortable while economy class customers are more sensitive to price than comfort , airlines may have substantial incentives to purposely make economy seating uncomfortable in the example of coffee , a restaurant may gain more economic profit by making poor quality regular coffeeâ€”more profit is gained from up-selling to premium customers than is lost from customers who refuse to purchase inexpensive but poor quality coffee in such cases , the net social utility should also account for the '' lost '' utility to consumers of the regular product , although determining the magnitude of this foregone utility may not be feasible market stall-holders and individual public transport providers may also insist on higher prices for their goods and services when dealing with foreigners ( sometimes called the '' white man tax '' ) a variety of incentive techniques may be used to increase market share or revenues at the retail level these may be quite targeted , as they are designed to generate specific activity , such as buying more frequently , buying more regularly , buying in bigger quantities , buying new products with established ones , and so on gender-based price discrimination is the practice of offering identical or similar services and products to men and women at different prices when the cost of producing the products and services is the same in europe , motor insurance premiums have historically been higher for men than for women , a practice that the insurance industry attempts to justify on the basis of different levels of risk since the purchasing power of african consumers is much lower , sales would be extremely limited without price discrimination even online sales for non material goods , which do not have to be shipped , may change according to the geographic location of the buyer some academic software may have differing licenses than retail versions , usually disallowing their use in activities for profit or expiring the license after a given number of months this also has the characteristics of an '' initial offer '' - that is , the profits from an academic customer may come partly in the form of future non-academic sales due to vendor lock-in sliding scale fees are when different customers are charged different prices based on their income , which is used as a proxy for their willingness or ability to pay thus the clients paying a higher price at the top of the fee scale help subsidize the clients at the bottom of the scale this differential pricing enables the nonprofit to serve a broader segment of the market than they could if they only set one price first the firm must be able to identify market segments by their price elasticity of demand and second the firms must be able to enforce the scheme while the conventional theory of price discrimination generally assumes that prices are set by the seller , there is a variant form in which prices are set by the buyer , such as in the form of pay what you want pricing
