actuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial , life insurance , and annuities this requires estimating future contingent events , such as the rates of mortality by age , as well as the development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested this led to the development of an important actuarial concept , referred to as the present value of a future sum certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern financial economics in traditional life insurance , actuarial science focuses on the analysis of mortality , the production of life tables , and the application of interest to produce life insurance , annuities and endowment policies actuarial science also aids in the design of benefit structures , reimbursement standards , and the effects of proposed government standards on the cost of healthcare the strategies are greatly influenced by short-term and long-term bond rates , the funded status of the pension and benefit arrangements , collective bargaining ; the employer 's old , new and foreign competitors ; the changing demographics of the workforce ; changes in the internal revenue code ; changes in the attitude of the internal revenue service regarding the calculation of surpluses ; and equally importantly , both the short and long term financial and economic trends when benefit changes occur , old and new benefit plans have to be blended , satisfying new social demands and various government discrimination test calculations , and providing employees and retirees with understandable choices and transition paths finally , funding schemes have to be developed that are manageable and satisfy the standards board or regulators of the appropriate country , such as the financial accounting standards board in the united states in the reinsurance fields , actuarial science can be used to design and price reinsurance and retrocession arrangements , and to establish reserve funds for known claims and future claims and catastrophes at the same time there was a rapidly growing desire and need to place the valuation of personal risk on a more scientific basis one could now set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people , and to calculate with some degree of accuracy how much each person in the group should contribute to a common fund assumed to earn a fixed rate of interest the calculations of life insurance premiums and reserving requirements are rather complex , and actuaries developed techniques to make the calculations as easy as possible , for example '' commutation functions '' ( essentially precalculated columns of summations over time of discounted values of survival and death probabilities ) traditional actuarial science and modern financial economics in the us have different practices , which is caused by different ways of calculating funding and investment strategies , and by different regulations the divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows , but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers today , the profession , both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations , is cognizant of the need to reflect the combined approach of tables , loss models , stochastic methods , and financial theory the current debate now seems to be focusing on four principles : financial models should be free of arbitrage assets and liabilities with identical cash flows should have the same price there is an increasing trend to recognize that actuarial skills can be applied to a range of applications outside the traditional fields of insurance , pensions , etc
