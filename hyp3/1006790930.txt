in common language , this is equivalent to saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement , then the consequent n must be trueâ€”if s is to be true ( see third column of '' truth table '' immediately below ) in other words , the antecedent s can not be true without n being true in the above situation , one can also say s is a sufficient condition for n ( refer again to the third column of the truth table immediately below ) if the conditional statement is true , then if s is true , n must be true ; whereas if the conditional statement is true and n is true , then s may be true or be false in common terms , '' the truth of s guarantees the truth of n '' for example , carrying on from the previous example , one can say that knowing that someone is called socrates is sufficient to know that someone has a name a necessary and sufficient condition requires that both of the implications s \rightarrow n and n \rightarrow s ( the latter of which can also be written as s \leftarrow n ) hold the first implication suggests that s is a sufficient condition for n , while the second implication suggests that s is a necessary condition for n one often finds , in mathematical prose for instance , several necessary conditions that , taken together , constitute a sufficient condition ( i.e ; example 2 : for the whole numbers greater than two , being odd is necessary to being prime , since two is the only whole number that is both even and prime if p is sufficient for q , then knowing p to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that q is true ; however , knowing p to be false does not meet a minimal need to conclude that q is false it may be the case that several sufficient conditions , when taken together , constitute a single necessary condition ( i.e none of these conditions is necessary to the card 's being an ace , but their disjunction is , since no card can be an ace without fulfilling at least ( in fact , exactly ) one of these conditions for instance , being a mammal ( n ) is necessary but not sufficient to being human ( s ) , and that a number x is rational ( s ) is sufficient but not necessary to x being a real number ( n ) ( since there are real numbers that are not rational ) equivalently , it may be understood to say that p and q is necessary for the other , p \rightarrow q \land q \rightarrow p , which can also be stated as each is sufficient for or implies the other might characterize this state of affairs thus : '' although the concepts of bipartiteness and absence of odd cycles differ in intension , they have identical extension because , as explained in previous section , necessity of one for the other is equivalent to sufficiency of the other for the first one , e.g
