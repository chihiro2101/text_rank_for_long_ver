current collectors are electrically conductive and allow current to flow through to the train or tram and back to the feeder station through the steel wheels on one or both running rails non-electric locomotives ( such as diesels ) may pass along these tracks without affecting the overhead line , although there may be difficulties with structure gauge this wire approximates the natural path of a wire strung between two points , a catenary curve , thus the use of '' catenary '' to describe this wire or sometimes the whole system depot areas tend to have only a single wire and are known as '' simple equipment '' or '' trolley wire '' when overhead line systems were first conceived , good current collection was possible only at low speeds , using a single wire to enable higher speeds , two additional types of equipment were developed : stitched equipment uses an additional wire at each support structure , terminated on either side of the messenger/catenary wire trams and railways use the overhead line as one side of the circuit and the steel rails as the other side of the circuit for a trolleybus or a trolleytruck , no rails are available for the return current , as the vehicles use rubber tyres on the road surface trolleybuses use a second parallel overhead line for the return , and two trolley poles , one contacting each overhead wire for low speeds and in tunnels where temperatures are constant , fixed termination ( ft ) equipment may be used , with the wires terminated directly on structures at each end of the overhead line to allow maintenance to the overhead line without having to turn off the entire system , the line is broken into electrically separated portions known as '' sections '' the transition from section to section is known as a '' section break '' and is set up so that the vehicle 's pantograph is in continuous contact with one wire or the other for bow collectors and pantographs , this is done by having two contact wires run side by side over the length between 2 or 4 wire supports in normal service , the two sections are electrically connected ; depending on the system this might be an isolator , fixed contact or a booster transformer ) the locomotive would become trapped , but as it passes the section break the pantograph briefly shorts the two catenary lines sometimes on a larger electrified railway , tramway or trolleybus system it is necessary to power different areas of track from different power grids , without guaranteeing synchronisation of the phases ac systems have a particular safety implication in that the railway electrification system would act as a '' backdoor '' connection between different parts , resulting in , amongst other things , a section of the grid de-energised for maintenance being re-energised from the railway substation creating danger in countries such as france , south africa and the united kingdom , a pair of permanent magnets beside the rails at either side of the neutral section operate a bogie-mounted transducer on the train which causes a large electrical circuit-breaker to open and close when the locomotive or the pantograph vehicle of a multiple unit passes over them in the united kingdom equipment similar to automatic warning system ( aws ) is used , but with pairs of magnets placed the running rails ( as opposed to the aws magnets placed midway between the rails ) a neutral section or phase break consists of two insulated breaks back-to-back with a short section of line that belongs to neither grid the presence of the earthed section in the middle is to ensure that should the transducer controlled apparatus fail , and the driver also fail to shut off power , the energy in the arc struck by the pantograph as it passes to the neutral section is conducted to earth , operating substation circuit breakers , rather than the arc either bridging the insulators into a section made dead for maintenance , a section fed from a different phase , or setting up a backdoor connection between different parts of the country 's national grid on the pennsylvania railroad , phase breaks were indicated by a position light signal face with all eight radial positions with lenses and no center light phase breaks that were always activated were known as '' dead sections '' : they were often used to separate power systems ( for example , the hell 's gate bridge boundary between amtrak and metro north 's electrifications ) that would never be in-phase occasionally gaps may be present in the overhead lines , when switching from one voltage to another or to provide clearance for ships at moveable bridges , as a cheaper alternative for moveable overhead power rails given limited clearance such as in tunnels , the overhead wire may be replaced by a rigid overhead rail a rigid overhead rail may also be used in places where tensioning the wires is impractical , for example on moveable bridges in a movable bridge that uses a rigid overhead rail , there is a need to transition from the catenary wire system into an overhead conductor rail at the bridge portal ( the last post before the movable bridge ) for example , the power supply can be done through a catenary wire system near a swing bridge to connect the conductor rails together when the bridge is closed , there is another conductor rail section called '' rotary overlap '' that is equipped with a motor when the bridge is fully closed , the motor of the rotary overlap is operated to turn it from a tilted position into the horizontal position , connecting the conductor rails at the transition end section and the bridge together to supply power trolleybuses draw from two overhead wires at a similar voltage , and at least one of the trolleybus wires must be insulated from tram wires this is usually done by the trolleybus wires running continuously through the crossing , with the tram conductors a few centimetres lower some railways used two or three overhead lines , usually to carry three-phase current all systems with multiple overhead lines have high risk of short circuits at switches and therefore tend to be impractical in use , especially when high voltages are used or when trains run through the points at high speed to be able to use different electric systems on shared tracks , the sihltal line has its overhead wire right above the train , whilst the uetliberg line has its overhead wire off to one side catenary systems are suited to high-speed operations whereas simple wire systems , which are less expensive to build and maintain , are common on light rail or tram ( streetcar ) lines , especially on city streets in cleveland , ohio the rta rapid transit lines and the heavy rail line use the same overhead wires , due to a city ordinance intended to limit air pollution from the large number of steam trains that passed through cleveland between the east coast and chicago the height of overhead line can create hazards at level crossings , where it may be struck by road vehicles china and india operate lines electrified with extra height wiring and pantographs to allow for double stack container trains overhead lines , like most electrified systems , require a greater capital expenditure when building the system than an equivalent non-electric system while a conventional rail line requires only the grade , ballast , ties and rails , an overhead system also requires a complex system of support structures , lines , insulators , power-control systems and power lines , all of which require maintenance many people consider overhead lines to be '' visual pollution '' , due to the many support structures and complicated system of wires and cables that fill the air such considerations have driven the move towards replacing overhead power and communications lines with buried cables where possible
