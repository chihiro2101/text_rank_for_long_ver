the simple leaves of plants with either habit are arranged alternately ; the acaulescent species produce basal rosettes the flowers of the vast majority of the species are strongly zygomorphic with bilateral symmetry and solitary , but occasionally form cymes the shape of the petals and placement defines many species , for example , some species have a '' spur '' on the end of each petal while most have a spur on the lower petal the flowers have a superior ovary with one cell , which has three placentae , containing many ovules after flowering , fruit capsules are produced that are thick walled , with few to many seeds per carpel , and dehisce ( split open ) by way of three valves when jussieu established the hierarchical system of families ( 1789 ) , he placed viola in the cisti ( rock roses ) , though by 1811 he suggested viola be separated from these however , in 1802 batsch had already established a separate family , which he called violariae based on viola as the type genus , with seven other genera viola is a large genus , that has traditionally been treated in sections one of these was that of gingins ( 1823 ) , based on stigma morphology , with five sections ( nomimium , dischidium , chamaemelanium , melanium , leptidium ) ( 1998 ) have shown that many of these traditional divisions are not monophyletic , the problem being related to a high degree of hybridization in particular section nomimium was dismembered into several new sections and transferring part of it to section viola in that analysis , the s american sections appear to be the basal groups , starting with rubellium , then leptidium place the five s american sections , andinium , leptidium , tridens , rubellium and chilenium at the base of the phylogenetic tree , in that order the genus includes dog violets , a group of scentless species which are the most common viola in many areas , sweet violet ( viola odorata ) ( named from its sweet scent ) , and many other species whose common name includes the word '' violet ''
