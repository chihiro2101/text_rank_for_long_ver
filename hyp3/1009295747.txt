between 80 and 90 % of people with bladder cancer initially presented with visible blood blood in the urine may also be caused by other conditions , such as bladder or ureteric stones , infection , kidney disease , kidney cancers or vascular malformations , though these conditions ( except kidney cancers ) would typically be painful these signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer , and may also be caused by non-cancerous conditions , including prostate infections , overactive bladder or cystitis tobacco smoking is the main known contributor to urinary bladder cancer ; in most populations , smoking is associated with over half of bladder cancer cases in men and one-third of cases among women , however these proportions have reduced over recent years since there are fewer smokers in europe and north america there is an almost linear relationship between smoking duration ( in years ) , pack-year and bladder cancer risk risk of bladder cancer decreases by 30 % within 1–4 years and continues to decrease by 60 % at 25 years after smoking cessation opium consumption increases the risk of bladder cancer by 3-fold and concurrent use of opium and smoking increases the risk of bladder cancer by 5 times compared to the general population thirty percent of bladder tumors probably result from occupational exposure in the workplace to carcinogens people who undergo external beam radiotherapy ( ebrt ) for prostate cancer have a higher risk of developing invasive bladder cancer 10–20 % risk increase ) associated with bladder cancer , for example , obesity deletion of both copies of the gstm1 gene has a modest increase in risk of bladder cancer similarly , mutations in nat2 ( n-acetyltransferase ) is associated with increased risk for bladder cancer various single-nucleotide polymorphisms in psca gene present on chromosome 8 have shown to increase the risk for bladder cancer loss of reactivity of this region to androgens is hypothesized as a cause of more number of aggressive tumors in women ( unlike in men who have higher amount of androgen ) however , visual detection in any form listed above , is not sufficient for establishing pathological classification , cell type or the stage of the present tumor increase in alkaline phosphatase levels without evidence of liver disease should be evaluated for bone metastasis by a bone scan cytology is not very sensitive for low-grade or grade 1 tumors ( a negative result can not reliably exclude bladder cancer ) but has a high specificity ( a positive result reliably detects bladder cancer ) however , detection accuracy is poor for low grade cancers and 10 % cancers are still missed this hypothesis is also supported by the fact that men undergoing androgen suppression therapy for unrelated reason seem to have a lower risk of developing bladder cancer in africa , men are more prone to do field work and are exposed to infection with schistosoma , this may explain to a certain extent the gap in incidence of squamous cell cancers in areas where bladder cancer is endemic one of the common signs of bladder cancer is hematuria and is quite often misdiagnosed as urinary tract infection in women , leading to a delay in diagnosis bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer accounting for 3.7 % of the new cancer cases bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the uk accounting for 2.7 % of all the new cancers cases bladder cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in men and the 12th most common cancer in women
