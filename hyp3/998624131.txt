the combined canal splits north of napton-on-the-hill : the oxford canal runs southwest and then turns south towards oxford via banbury the grand union canal runs north passing opposing marinas within a mile then northwest to birmingham via warwick within oxford 's conurbation , the end of the canal has two links to the thames : north of the city where dukes cut leads to king 's lock ; a few hundred yards ( metres ) from the heart of the city centre by oxford railway station after below isis lock the oxford canal ends abruptly at hythe bridge street near to the current hythe bridge over the castle mill stream , a backwater of the river thames that runs parallel to the oxford canal for its southernmost part the canal used to continue through a bridge under hythe bridge street to a turning basin and goods wharf south of hythe bridge street it then continued via a bridge under worcester street to end in a coal wharf beside new road the intention was to link the industrial english midlands to london via the river thames construction soon started again and by 1778 the canal had reached banbury the stretch of the canal from banbury to oxford was built as cheaply as possible for the next 15 years the oxford canal became one of the most important and profitable transport links in britain , with most commercial traffic between london and the midlands using the route a much more direct route between london and the midlands , the grand union canal , was completed in 1805 however , the short section between braunston and napton became the link between the warwick and napton canal and the grand junction canal , making it part of the busy direct route between birmingham and london when parliament considered the act of parliament for the building of the grand junction , the oxford canal successfully petitioned to make the grand junction pay '' bar tolls '' to the oxford canal to compensate for the loss of traffic south of napton the oxford canal exploited this by charging high tolls for grand junction traffic on this short section the straightening challenged the capacity of three locks at hillmorton , the first on the canal after the stop lock at hawkesbury junction in 1833 a section of the new line of canal in barby fields near dunchurch was used as a test site for a new wrought iron boat , swallow , built by graham and houston the northern section of the oxford canal between coventry , braunston and napton remained an important trunk route , and remained extremely busy with freight traffic until the 1960s as with most of britain 's narrow canal system , the oxford canal suffered from a rapid decline in freight traffic after the second world war by the mid-1950s very few narrowboats traded south of napton and the southern section was at one point being threatened with closure , although the northern section ( napton to coventry ) remained well-used by commercial traffic until the 1960s the stretch from oxford to kirtlington , where the oxfordshire way meets the canal , is also part of european walking route e2
