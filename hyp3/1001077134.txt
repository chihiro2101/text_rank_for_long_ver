traditionally , jews believe that god chose the jewish people to be in a jews as a chosen people , described by the torah itself , with particular obligations and responsibilities elucidated in the oral torah sometimes this choice is seen as charging the jewish people with a specific mission to be a light unto the nations , practice tikkun olam and to exemplify the covenant with god as described in the torah this view , however , did not preclude a belief that god has a relationship with other peoples rather , judaism held that god had entered into a covenant with all humankind , and that jews and non-jews alike have a relationship with god , each nation with its own unique relationship with god biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view : moses refers to the '' god of the spirits of all flesh '' , and the tanakh ( hebrew bible ) also identifies prophets outside the community of israel based on these statements , some rabbis theorized that , in the words of natan'el al-fayyumi , a yemenite jewish theologian of the 12th century , '' god permitted to every people something he forbade to others press , 1961 , ch.10 ) maimonides , one of judaism 's most important theologians and halakha , explained in detail why jesus was wrong to create christianity and why muhammad was wrong to create islam ; he laments the pains jews have suffered in persecution from followers of these new faiths as they attempted to supplant judaism ( in the case of christianity , called supersessionism ) however , maimonides then goes on to say that both faiths can be considered a positive part of god 's plan to redeem the world , muhammad who came after him , only served to clear the way for the jewish messiah to prepare the whole world to worship god with one accord , as it is written 'for then will i turn to the peoples a pure language , that they all call upon the name of the lord to serve him with one consent rabbi lord immanuel jakobovits , former chief rabbi of the united synagogue of great britain , describes a commonly held jewish view on this issue : '' yes , i do believe in the chosen people concept as affirmed by judaism in its holy writ , its prayers , and its millennial tradition '' the german-jewish philosopher moses mendelssohn ( 1729â€“1786 ) taught that '' according to the basic principles of my religion i am not to seek to convert anyone not born into our laws.we believe that the other nations of the earth are directed by god to observe only the natural law and the abrahamic religion.i fancy that whosoever leads men to virtue in this life can not be damned in the next in his view '' the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community his response was written in the light of past jewish-christian religious disputations , which traditionally had been forced upon the jewish community reflecting this stance , rabbi soloveitchik asked the christian community to respect '' the right of the community of the few to live , create and worship in its own way , in freedom and with dignity many traditional rabbis agree ; they hold that while cooperation with the christian community is of importance , theological dialogue is unnecessary , or even misguided 6 , 1964 ) today many orthodox rabbis use soloveitchik 's letter to justify having no discussion or joint efforts with christians in contrast , some modern orthodox rabbis such as eugene korn and david hartman hold that in some cases , the primary issue in confrontation is no longer valid ; some christian groups no longer attempt to use interfaith dialogue to convert jews to christianity they believe that the relationship between judaism and christianity has reached a point where jews can trust christian groups to respect them as equals in non-orthodox denominations of judaism most rabbis hold that jews have nothing to fear from engaging in theological dialogue , and may have much to gain the statement between jerusalem and rome does not hide the theological differences that exist between the two faith traditions while all the same it expresses a firm resolve to collaborate more closely , now and in the future conservative rabbi robert gordis wrote an essay on '' ground rules for a christian jewish dialogue '' ; in all jewish denominations , one form or another of these rules eventually became more or less accepted by parties engaging in jewish-christian theological dialogue robert gordis held that '' a rational dialogue conducted on the basis of knowledge and mutual respect between the two components of the religio-ethical tradition of the western world can prove a blessing to our age '' his proposed ground rules for fair discussion are : : ( 1 ) people should not label jews as worshiping an inferior '' old testament god of justice '' while saying that christians worship a superior '' god of love of the new testament '' : ( 4 ) christians need to understand that while judaism is based on the hebrew bible , it is not identical to the religion described in it '' gordis calls on jews to '' see in christian doctrine an effort to apprehend the nature of the divine that is worthy of respect and understanding '' and that '' the dogmas of the christian church have expressed this vision of god in terms that have proved meaningful to christian believers through the centuries '' he calls on jews to understand with tolerance and respect the historical and religious context which led christians to develop the concepts of the virgin birth , the incarnation , the passion , and the resurrection , even if jews themselves do not accept these ideas as correct similarly , gordis calls on christians to understand with tolerance and respect that jews do not accept these beliefs , since they are in contradiction to the jewish understanding of the unity of god of chicago press , 1962 ) recently , over 120 rabbis have signed the dabru emet ( '' speak the truth '' ) , a document concerning the relationship between judaism and christianity many modern thinkers , both jewish and gentile , have noted that god may well have seen fit to enter covenants with many nations most jewish theologians disagree , saying that the original meaning of the text was to condemn idolatry in total however , a growing number of jewish theologians question whether hindus and buddhists today should be considered idolaters in the biblical sense of the term their beliefs have far more theological depth than ancient pagans , and they are well aware that icons they worship are only symbols of a deeper level of reality ( though the same can be said of modern-day pagans ) , ( b ) they do not practice child sacrifice , ( c ) they are of high moral character , and ( d ) they are not anti-jewish the article on relationships between jewish religious movements describes how the different jewish denominations view each other and interact with each other & nbsp ;
