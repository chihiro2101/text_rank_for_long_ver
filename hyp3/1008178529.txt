early life and political career it was also during his university studies , around 1894 , that paasikivi first became involved in the fennoman movement , assuming leadership roles in its student organization he supported greater autonomy and an independent cabinet ( senate ) for finland , and resisted russia 's panslavic intentions to make russian the only official language everywhere in the russian empire during the world war i paasikivi began to doubt the finnish party 's obedient line in 1914 , after resigning his position at the treasury , and also standing down as a member of parliament , paasikivi left public life and office during the finnish civil war paasikivi stood firmly on the side of the white government paasikivi 's senate was in power during the existence of the prison camps following the civil war in finland , where 12,000 prisoners died in total however , he was persuaded to accept the position of envoy to sweden , at the time regarded as finland 's most important foreign embassy post after the gradual dissolution of the league of nations , and france 's and the united kingdom 's lack of interest in supporting finland , sweden was the only regime left that possibly could give finland any support at all since around the time of the failed lapua coup , paasikivi and mannerheim had belonged to a close circle of conservative finns discussing how sweden 's support could be obtained the revolutionary turmoil at the end of world war i had led to parliamentarism in sweden , increased swedish democracy , and a dominant role for the swedish social democrats in finland , however , the result had been a disastrous civil war and a total defeat for socialism this did n't improve paasikivi 's reputation among the swedish social democrats dominating the government , who were sufficiently suspicious due to his association with finland 's monarchist orientation in 1918 , and the failed lapua coup in 1932 but the suspicions between finland and sweden were too strong : during the winter war sweden 's support for finland was considerable , but short of one critical feature : sweden neither declared war on the soviet union nor sent regular troops to finland 's defense this made many finns , including paasikivi himself , judge his mission in stockholm a failure when the war broke out , paasikivi was asked to enter risto ryti ’ s cabinet as a minister without portfolio—in practice in the role of a distinguished political advisor in moscow he was necessarily isolated from the most secret thoughts in helsinki ; and when he found out that these thoughts ran in the direction of revanche , of retaking , with germany 's aid , territory lost in the winter war , he resigned by 1943 he had concluded that germany was going to lose the war and that finland was in great danger as well however , his initial opposition to the pro-german politics of 1940–1941 was too well known , and his first initiatives for peace negotiations were met with little support from either field marshal mannerheim or risto ryti , who now had become president his main effort was to prove that finland would present no threat to the soviet union , and that both countries would gain from confident peaceful relations as president , he only once accepted his party , the conservatives , into the government ; and even that government lasted only about six months and was considered more a caretaker or civil-servant government than a regular parliamentary government paasikivi 's political flexibility had its limits , however ; this was shown at the time of the communists ' alleged coup attempt or coup plans in spring 1948 most modern finnish historians deny that most communists wanted a violent coup , especially not without soviet support by the end of paasikivi 's six-year second term , finland had rid itself of the most urgent political problems resulting from the war however , paasikivi was willing to serve as president for about two more years if a great majority of politicians asked him to do so
