this was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press still , hand composition and letterpress printing have not fallen completely out of use , and since the introduction of digital typesetting , it has seen a revival as an artisanal pursuit while some , such as the paige compositor , met with limited success , by the end of the 19th century , several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text with the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device that mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative film the galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or paste up of a whole page ( webpage has a translation button ) character-by-character , computer-aided phototypesetting was , in turn , rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a raster image processor to render an entire page to a single high-resolution digital image , now known as imagesetting early minicomputer-based typesetting software introduced in the 1970s and early 1980s , such as datalogics pager , penta , atex , miles 33 , xyvision , troff from bell labs , and ibm 's script product with crt terminals , were better able to drive these electromechanical devices , and used text markup languages to describe type and other page formatting information the minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste-up and eventually produced entire pages and signatures of 4 , 8 , 16 or more pages using imposition software on devices such as the israeli-made scitex dolev the data stream used by these systems to drive page layout on printers and imagesetters , often proprietary or specific to a manufacturer or device , drove development of generalized printer control languages , such as adobe systems ' postscript and hewlett-packard 's pcl computerized typesetting was so rare that byte magazine ( comparing itself to '' the proverbial shoemaker 's children who went barefoot '' ) did not use any computers in production until its august 1979 issue used a compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout later versions of script included advanced features , such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index , multicolumn page layout , footnotes , boxes , automatic hyphenation and spelling verification in the 1970s , script was the only practical way to word process and format documents using a computer a chronology of computing at the university of waterloo the initial implementation of script at uw was documented in the may 1975 issue of the computing centre newsletter , which noted some the advantages of using script : the article also pointed out script had over 100 commands to assist in formatting documents , though 8 to 10 of these commands were sufficient to complete most formatting jobs thus , script had many of the capabilities computer users generally associate with contemporary word processors script is still available from ibm as part of the document composition facility for the z/os operating system the arrival of sgml/xml as the document model made other typesetting engines popular while its use has fallen off , it is still included with a number of unix and unix-like systems , and has been used to typeset a number of high-profile technical and computer books knuth at the end of the 1970s , is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system that has set high standards , especially for typesetting mathematics the latex macro package written by leslie lamport at the beginning of the 1980s offered a simpler interface , and an easier way to systematically encode the structure of a document although standard tex does not provide an interface of any sort , there are programs that do several other text formatting software exist , but are not widely used metal type â€“ for those who remember hot metal typesetting tex users group fundamentals of typesetting the lout document formatting system xml page at www.w3c.org sgml page at www.xml.org typeset-8 , the first low cost computerized type setting system 1960 era typesetting in the 1960 era
