the '' social security trust fund '' comprises two separate funds that hold federal government debt obligations related to what are traditionally thought of as social security benefits the trust funds are '' off-budget '' and treated separately in certain ways from other federal spending , and other trust funds of the federal government 5 , 1990 , , provided that : notwithstanding any other provision of law , the receipts and disbursements of the federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund and the federal disability insurance trust fund shall not be counted as new budget authority , outlays , receipts , or deficit or surplus for purposes of - ( 1 ) the budget of the united states government as submitted by the president , ( 2 ) the congressional budget , or ( 3 ) the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 if the trust funds begin running deficits , meaning more in benefits are paid out than contributions paid in , the social security administration is empowered to redeem the securities and use those funds to cover the deficit in the early 1980s , financial projections of the social security administration indicated near-term revenue from payroll taxes would not be sufficient to fully fund near-term benefits ( thus raising the possibility of benefit cuts ) the changes to federal law enacted in 1983 and signed by president reagan and pursuant to the recommendations of the greenspan commission advanced the time frame for previously scheduled payroll tax increases ( though it raised slightly the payroll tax for the self-employed to equal the employer-employee rate ) , changed certain benefit calculations , and raised the retirement age to 67 by the year 2027 1900 ) social security amendments of 1983-signed on april 20 , 1983 as of the end of calendar year 2010 , the accumulated surplus in the social security trust fund stood at just over 2.6 trillion social security benefits are paid from a combination of social security payroll taxes paid by current workers and interest income earned by the social security trust fund according to the projections of the social security administration , the trust fund will continue to show net growth until 2022 because the interest generated by its bonds and the revenue from payroll taxes exceeds the amount needed to pay benefits the 2015 trustees report press release ( which covered 2014 statistics ) stated : '' income including interest to the combined oasdi trust funds amounted to 884 billion in 2014 '' social security board of trustees annual report-press release-july 27 , 2015 some basic equations for understanding the fund balance include : fund ending balance for a given year fund starting balance + program revenues + interest - program payouts program annual surplus ( or deficit if negative ) program revenues + interest - program expenses program annual cash surplus ( or deficit if negative ) program revenues - program expenses '' program revenues '' has several components , including payroll tax contributions , taxation of benefits , and an accounting entry to reflect recent payroll tax cuts during 2011 and 2012 , to make the fund '' whole '' as if these tax cuts had not occurred the office of management and budget has described the distinction as follows : other public officials have argued that the trust funds do have financial or moral value , similar to the value of any other treasury bill , note or bond to escape paying either principal or interest on the '' special '' bonds held by the trust funds , the government would have to default on these obligations according to the social security trustees , continuing payroll tax revenues at the rate of 12.4 % will enable social security to pay about 74 % of promised benefits during the 2040s , with this ratio falling to about 70 % by the end of the forecast period in 2080 this increased public debt , but did not advance the year of depletion of the trust fund under current law , when the program goes into an annual cash deficit , the government has to seek alternate funding beyond the payroll taxes dedicated to the program to cover the shortfall if the parts of the budget outside of social security are in deficit , which the congressional budget office and multiple budget expert panels assume for the foreseeable future , there are several implications : additional debt must be issued to investors to obtain the funding necessary to pay this obligation this will increase '' debt held by the public '' while simultaneously reducing the '' intragovernmental debt '' represented by the trust fund on the other hand , if other parts of the budget are in surplus and program recipients can be paid from the general fund , then no additional debt need be issued if 1 added to the fund does not replace other borrowing or otherwise increase national savings , the trust fund is not '' real '' some economic research argues that the trust funds have led to only a small to modest increase in national savings and that the bulk of the trust fund has been '' spent ''
