a later version of the card clothing product developed during the latter half of the 19th century and was found only on commercial carding machines , whereby a single piece of serrated wire was wrapped around a roller , became known as metallic card clothing fibre may be carded by hand for hand spinning at the turn of the eighteenth century , wool in england was being carded using pairs of hand cards , in a two-stage process : 'working ' with the cards opposed and 'stripping ' where they are in parallel the first used a coat of wires on a flat table moved by foot pedals with woollen , two carding machines were used : the first or the scribbler opened and mixed the fibres , the second or the condenser mixed and formed the web he patented this machine and also a new form of card with layers of cloth and rubber by 1838 , the river spen , centred on cleckheaton had at least 11 card clothing factories and by 1893 , it was generally accepted as the card cloth capital of the world , though by 2008 only two manufacturers of metallic and flexible card clothing remained in england , garnett wire ltd the carding machine consists mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it these rovings ( or slubbings ) are then what are used in the spinning process intermediate frames are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn , and then the roving frames reduces it to a finer thread , gives more twist , makes more regular and even in thickness , and winds onto a smaller tube a pair of cards is used to brush the wool between them until the fibres are more or less aligned in the same direction carding of wool can either be done '' in the grease '' or not , depending on the type of machine and on the spinner 's preference hand carders ( and small drum carders too , though the directions may not recommend it ) can be used to card lanolin rich wool these machines generally have two rollers , or drums , covered with card clothing the two rollers are connected to each other by a belt- or chain-drive so that their relative speeds cause the storage drum to gently pull fibres from the licker-in fibre is added until the storage drum 's card cloth is full cottage carding machines differ significantly from the simple drum card as they are transferred to the swift , many of the fibres are straightened and laid into the swift 's card cloth a fine web of more or less parallel fibre , a few fibres thick and as wide as the carder 's rollers , exits the carder at the fly comb by gravity or other mechanical means for storage or further processing .
