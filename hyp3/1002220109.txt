the investors are given shares corresponding to their initial investment its shares ( typically ) trade on stock exchanges rather than being redeemed directly by the fund an open-end fund trades at its net asset value ( to which sales charges may be added ; and adjustments may be made for e.g a fund raises its initial equity through the sale of common stock in some cases , fund managers charge management fees based on the total managed assets of the fund , which includes leverage since stock in closed-end funds is traded like other stock , an investor trading them will pay a brokerage commission similar to that paid when trading other stocks ( as opposed to commissions on open-ended mutual funds , where the commission will vary based on the share class chosen and the method of purchasing the fund ) at that point , the fund 's 10 million shares will begin to trade on a secondary market , typically the nyse or the amex for american closed-end funds nor , typically , do they sell more shares after the ipo ( although they may issue preferred stock , in essence taking out a loan secured by the portfolio ) this is in contrast to some open-end funds which are only available for buying and selling at the close of business each day , at the calculated nav , and for which orders must be placed in advance , before the nav is known , and by simple buy or sell orders the price of a closed-end fund is completely determined by the valuation of the market , and this price often diverges substantially from the nav of the fund assets in contrast , the market price of an etf trades in a narrow range very close to its net asset value , because the structure of etfs allows major market participants to redeem shares of an etf for a '' basket '' of the fund 's underlying assets so investing 1000 into the fund means buying shares that lay claim to 1000 worth of underlying assets ( apart from sales charges and the fund 's investment costs ) but buying a closed-end fund trading at a premium might mean buying 900 worth of assets for 1000 cefs do not have to deal with the expense of creating and redeeming shares , they tend to keep less cash in their portfolio , and they need not worry about market fluctuations to maintain their '' performance record '' faced with a wave of sell orders and needing to raise money for redemptions , the manager of an open-ended fund may be forced to sell stocks he would rather keep , and keep stocks he would rather sell , because of liquidity concerns ( selling too much of any one stock causes the price to drop disproportionately ) but an investor pulling out of a closed-end fund must sell it on the market to another buyer , so the manager need not sell any of the underlying stock
