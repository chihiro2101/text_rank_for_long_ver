if this type of lamp is broken , it can easily start a fire the glass chimney needs a '' throat '' , or slight constriction , to create the proper draft for complete combustion of the fuel ; the draft carries more air ( oxygen ) past the flame , helping to produce a smokeless light , which is brighter than an open flame would produce all kerosene flat-wick lamps use the dead-flame burner design , where the flame is fed cold air from below , and hot air exits above when the lamp is lit , the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly the mantle typically contains thorium or other rare-earth salts ; on first use the cloth burns away , and the rare-earth salts are converted to oxides , leaving a very fragile structure , which incandesces ( glows brightly ) upon exposure to the heat of the burner flame mantle lamps typically use fuel faster than a flat-wick lamp , but slower than a center-draught round-wick , as they depend on a small flame heating a mantle , rather than having all the light coming from the flame itself mantle lamps are nearly always bright enough to benefit from a lampshade , and a few mantle lamps may be enough to heat a small building in cold weather mantle lamps , because of the higher temperature at which they operate , do not produce much odor , except when first lit or extinguished like flat- and round-wick lamps , they can be adjusted for brightness ; however , caution must be used , because if set too high , the lamp chimney and the mantle can become covered with black areas of soot large fixed pressurized kerosene mantle lamps were used in lighthouse beacons for navigation of ships , brighter and with lower fuel consumption than oil lamps used before both hot-blast and cold-blast designs are called tubular lanterns and are safer than dead-flame lamps , as tipping over a tubular lantern cuts off the oxygen flow to the burner and will extinguish the flame within seconds the earliest portable kerosene '' glass globe '' lanterns , of the 1850s and 1860s , were of the dead-flame type , meaning that it had an open wick , but the airflow to the flame was strictly controlled in an upward motion by a combination of vents at the bottom of the burner and an open topped chimney later lanterns , such as the hot-blast and cold-blast lanterns , took this airflow control even further by partially or fully enclosing the wick in a '' deflector '' or '' burner cone '' and then channeling the air to be supplied for combustion at the wick while at the same time pre-heating the air for combustion this design is similar to his earlier '' hot-blast '' design , except that the oxygen-depleted hot combustion byproducts are redirected and prevented from recirculating back to the burner by redesigning the intake products , so that only oxygen-rich , fresh air is drawn from the atmosphere into the lamp ( '' the inlets for fresh air are placed out of the ascending current of products of combustion , and said products are thereby prevented from entering the air intake '' )
