no clear physical boundary marks the river 's eastern end ; the international hydrographic organization defines the eastern boundary of the río de la plata as '' a line joining punta del este , uruguay and cabo san antonio , argentina '' though it is generally spoken of as a river , the río de la plata is considered by some geographers to be a large bay or marginal sea of the atlantic ocean because of deposition of sediments from the heavy stream load carried down from the river 's tributaries , the islands in the río de la plata generally grow over time the freshwater comes principally from the paraná river ( one of the world 's longest rivers and la plata 's main tributary ) as well as from the uruguay river and other smaller streams currents in the río de la plata are dominated by tides reaching to its sources and beyond , into the uruguay and paraná rivers the tidal ranges in the río de la plata are small , but its great width allows for a tidal prism important enough to dominate the flow regime despite the huge discharge received from the tributary rivers making up about one fourth of the continent 's surface , it is the second largest drainage basin in south america ( after the amazon basin ) and one of the largest in the world '' the portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan briefly explored the estuary in 1520 before his expedition continued its circumnavigation , and in 1521 cristóvão jacques also explored the plate river estuary and ascended the parana river for the first time , entering it for about 23 leagues ( around 140 & nbsp ; km ) to near the present city of rosario he explored the paraná and uruguay rivers between 1526 and 1529 , ascending the paraná as far as the present-day city of asunción , and also explored up the paraguay river cabot acquired silver trinkets trading with the guaraní near today 's asunción , and these objects ( together with legends of a '' sierra de la plata '' in the south american interior brought back by earlier explorers ) inspired him to rename the river '' río de la plata '' ( '' river of silver '' ) the río de la plata region , particularly buenos aires , was a significant site of trade throughout the 17th century although trade along the río de la plata flourished , very little silver was actually remitted to the crown this caused a schism between merchants who wanted to try to continue reviving the spanish empire through silver trade and those who wanted to move on from silver and prioritize agricultural exports , ultimately tearing at the fabric of the río de la plata region 's relationship with the spanish empire during the cisplatine war , the battle of juncal ( named after juncal island ) took place in the waters of the río de la plata from 8–9 february 1827 between squadrons of the newly independent united provinces of the river plate and the brazilian empire the estuary has been known as the river plate or plate river in english since at least the time of francis drake treaty between uruguay and argentina concerning the rio de la plata and the corresponding maritime boundary ( 19 november 1973 ) paraguay , or the province of the rio de la plata , with the adjacent regions tucamen and santa cruz de la sierra is a map from 1616 depicting the area '' an account of a voyage up the river de la plata , and thence over land to peru : with observations on the inhabitants , as well as indians and spaniards , the cities , commerce , fertility , and riches of that part of america '' from 1698
