) later in 1967 , cp/cms became generally available on the ibm system/360 model 67 , where , although the new control program cp-67 was a substantial re-implementation of cp-40 , cms remained essentially the same ibm provided cp/cms '' as is '' & ndash ; without any support , in source code form , as part of the ibm type-iii library despite this lack of support from ibm , cp/cms achieved great success as a time-sharing platform ; by 1972 , there were some 44 cp/cms systems in use , including commercial sites that resold access to cp/cms in 1972 , ibm released its vm/370 operating system , a re-implementation of cp/cms for the system/370 , in an announcement that also added virtual memory hardware to the system/370 series many key user interface decisions familiar to today 's users had already been made in 1965 , as part of the cp-40 effort an exceptionally strong user community , first established in the self-support days of cp/cms but remaining active after the launch of vm , made substantial contributions to the operating system , and mitigated the difficulties of running ibm 's '' other operating system '' this approach has remained consistent through the years , and is based on : full virtualization , used to create multiple independent virtual machines that each completely simulate the underlying hardware paravirtualization , used to provide a hypervisor interface that cms uses to access vm services ; this is implemented by the non-virtualized diag ( diagnose ) instruction more details on how cms interacts with the virtual machine environment can be found in the vm and cp/cms articles however , cms can no longer run outside the vm environment , which provides the hypervisor interface needed for various critical functions the 3270 family incorporated '' smart '' control units , concentrators , and other network processing elements , communicating with the mainframe over dedicated circuits at relatively high speeds , via a bisync synchronous data transmission protocol however , these devices rarely competed for 3270 users ; ibm maintained its dominance over mainframe data center hardware purchase decisions this approach , preferred by ibm , led to the development of entirely different user interface paradigms and programming strategies cms earned a very good reputation for being efficient , and for having good human factors for ease of use , relative to the standards of the time ( and of course prior to widespread use of graphical user interface environments such as are commonly used today ) it was not uncommon to have hundreds ( later : thousands ) of concurrent cms interactive users on the same vm mainframe , with sub-second response times for common , 'trivial ' functions vm/cms was often used as a development platform for production systems that ran under ibm 's other operating systems , such as mvs
