a globally ambiguous sentence is one that has at least two distinct interpretations in this type of ambiguity , after one has read or heard the entire sentence , the ambiguity is still present sometimes , local ambiguities can result in garden path sentence , in which a structurally sound sentence is difficult to interpret because one interpretation of the ambiguous region is not the ultimate coherent interpretation '' aristotle writes about an influence of ambiguities on arguments and also about an influence of ambiguities depending on either combination or division of words : caldwell '' modern logic and judicial decision making : a sketch of one view '' in h.w , new york , usa , 1963 , 213 , at 228 controlled natural languages are often designed to be unambiguous so that they can be parsed into a logical form according to the reanalysis model , processing difficulty occurs once the reader has realized that their sentence analysis is false ( with regards to the already adopted syntactic structure ) , and they must then return and reevaluate the structure most reanalysis models , like the unrestricted race model , are serial in nature , which implies that only one analysis can be evaluated at a time results of many experiments tracking the eye-movements of subjects has demonstrated that it is just as difficult to process a globally ambiguous statement ( 1 ) as an unambiguous statement ( 2 and 3 ) because information before the ambiguity does not provide a strong bias for either syntactic possibility the unrestricted race model states that analysis is affected prior to the introduction of ambiguity and affects which meaning is adopted ( based on probability ) before multiple analyses are able to be introduced in contrast to constraint-based theories , only one analysis is constructed at a time because only a single analysis is available at any time , reanalysis may sometimes be necessary if information following the initial analysis is inconsistent with it however , the name '' unrestricted race '' comes directly from its adopted properties of the constraint-based models this is referred to as the underspecification account as readers do not commit to a meaning when not provided with disambiguating information children have not yet learned how the environment and contextual clues can suggest a certain interpretation of a sentence they have also not yet developed the ability to acknowledge that ambiguous words and phrases can be interpreted multiple ways as children read and interpret syntactically ambiguous sentences , the speed at which initial syntactic commitments are made is slower in children than in adults furthermore , children appear to be less skilled at directing their attention back to the part of the sentence that is most informative in terms of aiding reanalysis while adults tend to have a higher working memory span , they sometimes spend more time resolving the ambiguity but tend to be more accurate in their final interpretation children , on the other hand , can decide quickly on an interpretation because they consider only the interpretations their working memory can hold within the high reading span subjects , however , they responded faster to inanimate subjects and took longer to respond to animate subjects this suggested that since the low reading span subjects had less cognitive resources , only syntactic cues could be processed while high reading span subjects had more cognitive resources and could thus get tripped up with the garden path sentence ambiguous grammar dangling modifier eats , shoots & leaves equivocation garden path sentence ibis redibis nunquam per bella peribis list of linguistic example sentences natural language processing paraprosdokian reading span task the purple people eater transderivational search
