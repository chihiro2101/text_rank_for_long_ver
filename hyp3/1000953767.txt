when the antenna was aligned so it pointed at the signal it produced maximum gain , and produced zero signal when face on later experimenters also used dipole antennas , which worked in the opposite sense , reaching maximum gain at right angles and zero when aligned early radio systems generally used medium wave and longwave signals longwave in particular had good long-distance transmission characteristics due to their limited interaction with the ground , and thereby provided excellent great circle route ground wave propagation that pointed directly to the transmitter for longwave use , this resulted in loop antennas tens of feet on a side , often with more than one loop connected together to improve the signal a separate loop antenna located in this area could then be used to hunt for the direction , without moving the main antennas this made rdf so much more practical that it was soon being used for navigation on a wide scale , often as the first form of aerial navigation available , with ground stations homing in on the aircraft 's radio set early rdf systems were useful largely for long wave signals when the office was moved , his new location at a radio research station provided him with both an adcock antenna and a suitable oscilloscope , and he presented his new system in 1926 to avoid rdf , the germans had developed a method of broadcasting short messages under 30 seconds , less than the 60 seconds that a trained bellini-tosi operator would need to determine the direction in particular , the ability to compare the phase of signals led to phase-comparison rdf , which is perhaps the most widely used technique today signals from the loops are sent into a phase comparison circuit , whose output phase directly indicates the direction of the signal operation consists solely of tuning in the station , and is so automatic that these systems are normally referred to as automatic direction finder radio direction finding works by comparing the signal strength of a directional antenna pointing in different directions at first , this system was used by land and marine-based radio operators , using a simple rotatable loop antenna linked to a degree indicator in use , the rdf operator would first tune the receiver to the correct frequency , then manually turn the loop , either listening or watching an s meter to determine the direction of the null ( the direction at which a given signal is weakest ) of a long wave ( lw ) or medium wave ( am ) broadcast beacon or station ( listening for the null is easier than listening for a peak signal , and normally produces a more accurate result ) a key breakthrough was the introduction of a secondary vertical whip or loop antenna that substantiated the correct bearing and allowed the navigator to avoid plotting a bearing 180 degrees opposite the actual heading navy rdf model se 995 which used a sense antenna was in use during world war i the transmitter sends a morse code transmission on a long wave ( 150 – 400 & nbsp ; khz ) or medium wave ( 520 – 1720 & nbsp ; khz ) frequency incorporating the station 's identifier that is used to confirm the station and its operational status as the commercial medium wave broadcast band lies within the frequency capability of most rdf units , these stations and their transmitters can also be used for navigational fixes while these commercial radio stations can be useful due to their high power and location near major cities , there may be several miles between the location of the station and its transmitter , which can reduce the accuracy of the 'fix ' when approaching the broadcast city in the united states , commercial am radio stations were required to broadcast their station identifier once per hour for use by pilots and mariners as an aid to navigation however the low cost of adf and rdf systems , and the continued existence of am broadcast stations ( as well as navigational beacons in countries outside north america ) has allowed these devices to continue to function , primarily for use in small boats , as an adjunct or backup to gps automatic direction finder ( adf ) acronyms and abbreviations in avionics amateur radio direction finding battle of the beams cardioid direction finding hf/df radio navigation real-time locating system traffic analysis vor/dme wullenweber
