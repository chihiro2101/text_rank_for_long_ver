potter 's work laid the foundation for global ethics , a discipline centered around the link between biology , ecology , medicine , and human values he stated that he thought of the word after returning from a discussion earlier that evening at georgetown university , where he discussed with others a possible kennedy family sponsorship of an institute focused around the '' application of moral philosophy to concrete medical dilemmas bioethicists often disagree among themselves over the precise limits of their discipline , debating whether the field should concern itself with the ethical evaluation of all questions involving biology and medicine , or only a subset of these questions these developments will affect future evolution , and may require new principles that address life at its core , such as biotic ethics that values life itself at its basic biological processes and structures , and seeks their propagation one of the first areas addressed by modern bioethicists was that of human experimentation the national commission for the protection of human subjects of biomedical and behavioral research was initially established in 1974 to identify the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects however , the fundamental principles announced in the belmont report ( 1979 ) —namely , respect for persons , beneficence and justice—have influenced the thinking of bioethicists across a wide range of issues overall , the belmont report has guided research in a direction focused on protecting vulnerable subjects as well as pushing for transparency between the researcher and the subject research has flourished within the past 40 years and due to the advance in technology , it is thought that human subjects have outgrown the belmont report and the need for revision is desired using these four principles and thinking about what the physicians ’ specific concern is for their scope of practice can help physicians make moral decisions medical ethics tends to be understood narrowly as an applied professional ethics ; whereas bioethics has a more expansive application , touching upon the philosophy of science and issues of biotechnology a bioethicist assists the health care and research community in examining moral issues involved in our understanding of life and death , and resolving ethical dilemmas in medicine and science examples of this would be the topic of equality in medicine , the intersection of cultural practices and medical care , and issues of bioterrorism the field , formerly dominated by formally trained philosophers , has become increasingly interdisciplinary , with some critics even claiming that the methods of analytic philosophy have had a negative effect on the field 's development the chinese believe that the family , community , and individual are all interdependent of each other , so it is common for the family unit to collectively make decisions regarding healthcare and medical decisions for a loved one , instead of an individual making an independent decision for his or her self some argue that spirituality and understanding one another as spiritual beings and moral agents is an important aspect of bioethics , and that spirituality and bioethics are heavily intertwined with one another as a healthcare provider , it is important to know and understand varying world views and religious beliefs without this connection or understanding , patients can be at risk of becoming '' faceless units of work '' and being looked at as a '' set of medical conditions '' as opposed to the storied and spiritual beings that they are western bioethics is focused around rights , especially individual rights a high value and worth is placed on human life in islam , and in turn human life is deeply valued in the practice of islamic bioethics as well this study first gained prevalence in the field of reproductive medicine as it was viewed as a '' woman 's issue '' lindemann notes the need for the future agenda of feminist approaches to bioethics to expand further to include healthcare organizational ethics , genetics , stem cell , and more since created in 1992 , the international journal of feminist approaches to bioethics has done much work to legitimize feminist work and theory in bioethics every medical school in canada teaches bioethics so that students can gain an understanding of biomedical ethics and use the knowledge gained in their future careers to provide better patient care additionally , bioethics has been condemned for its lack of diversity in thought , particularly with regards to race even as the field has grown to include the areas of public opinion , policymaking , and medical decisions , little to no academic writing has been authored concerning the intersection between race–especially the cultural values imbued in that construct–and bioethical literature however , differing views on bioethics ' lack of diversity of thought and social inclusivity have also been advanced thought historian heikki saxén has argued that the diversity of thought and social inclusivity are the two essential cornerstones of bioethics , albeit they have not been fully realized
