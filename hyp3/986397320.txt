many theories have been proposed since the beginning of quantum mechanics and quantum measurement continues to be an active research area in both theoretical and experimental physics that theory was based in turn on the theory of projection-valued measures for self-adjoint operators which had been recently developed ( by von neumann and independently by marshall stone ) and the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics ( attributed by von neumann to paul dirac ) in this formulation , the state of a physical system corresponds to a vector of length 1 in a hilbert space h over the complex numbers quantum mechanics , moreover , gives a recipe for computing a probability distribution pr on the possible outcomes given the initial system state is ψ quantum indeterminacy is often understood as information ( or lack of it ) whose existence we infer , occurring in individual quantum systems , prior to measurement quantum randomness is the statistical manifestation of that indeterminacy , witnessable in results of experiments repeated many times gregg jaeger , '' quantum randomness and unpredictability '' philosophical transactions of the royal society of london a doi/10.1002/prop.201600053 ( 2016 ) online pdf in classical physics , experiments of chance , such as coin-tossing and dice-throwing , are deterministic , in the sense that , perfect knowledge of the initial conditions would render outcomes perfectly predictable in diametrical contrast , in the case of quantum physics , the theorems of kochen and specker , s kochen and e p specker , the problem of hidden variables in quantum mechanics , journal of mathematics and mechanics 17 ( 1967 ) , 59–87 they proved that quantum randomness is , exclusively , the output of measurement experiments whose input settings introduce logical independence into quantum systems in 2020 , steve faulkner reported on work following up on the findings of tomasz paterek et al ; showing what logical independence in the paterek boolean propositions means , in the domain of matrix mechanics proper common misconceptions regarding quantum mechanics see especially part iii '' misconceptions regarding measurement '' .
