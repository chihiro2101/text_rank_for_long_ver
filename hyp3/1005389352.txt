nbg and zfc are equivalent set theories in the sense that any theorem not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other moreover , robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in general set theory , a small fragment of zfc using models , they proved this subtheory consistent , and proved that each of the axioms of extensionality , replacement , and power set is independent of the four remaining axioms of this subtheory if consistent , zfc can not prove the existence of the inaccessible cardinals that category theory requires the independence is usually proved by forcing , whereby it is shown that every countable transitive model of zfc ( sometimes augmented with large cardinal axioms ) can be expanded to satisfy the statement in question however , some statements that are true about constructible sets are not consistent with hypothesized large cardinal axioms this approach employs the statement whose independence is being examined , to prove the existence of a set model of zfc , in which case con ( zfc ) is true hence no statement allowing such a proof can be proved in zfc the project to unify set theorists behind additional axioms to resolve the continuum hypothesis or other meta-mathematical ambiguities is sometimes known as '' gödel 's program '' some of '' mainstream mathematics '' ( mathematics not directly connected with axiomatic set theory ) is beyond peano arithmetic and second-order arithmetic , but still , all such mathematics can be carried out in zc ( zermelo set theory with choice ) , another theory weaker than zfc much of the power of zfc , including the axiom of regularity and the axiom schema of replacement , is included primarily to facilitate the study of the set theory itself unlike von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) and morse–kelley set theory ( mk ) , zfc does not admit the existence of proper classes
