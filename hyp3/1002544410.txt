on the 16 august , napoleon had sent marshal saint-cyr 's corps to fortify and hold dresden in order to hinder allied movements and to serve as a possible base for his own manoeuvres the city 's weak defenses were clear from this vantage point : the french and saxon garrison of 20,000 men under marshal saint-cyr could not hope to hold a city of that size the army of bohemia was divided into three parts : the left wing consisted of austrians and commanded by schwarzenberg himself and included the 9 divisions of infantry , 3 divisions of cavalry and 128 guns ; the right wing consisted of russians and prussians under wittgenstein and included 2 russian infantry divisions and von kleist 's prussian corps and 158 guns ; the reserves behind the center consisted of the best russian and prussian troops under barclay de tolly and included 2 russian grenadier divisions , 4 russian guard cavalry divisions , the prussian royal guard and about 150 guns napoleon arrived from the north about 10:00am with the guard infantry and murat 's i cavalry corps arriving shortly afterwards , covering in forced marches over three days shortly after 11:00am , the coalition monarchs noticed the stream of french troops hurrying into dresden from the north the coalition finally began a bombardment and general assault starting about 3:00pm against the southern suburbs of the city as the coalition forces made progress , napoleon swiftly dispatched reinforcements to the threatened areas - the i cavalry corps to the french right , ney and the ii young guard corps to the center and mortier and the i young guard corps to the french left after being reinforced overnight with victor 's ii corps , marmont 's vi corps and the guard cavalry , napoleon attacked the following morning on the 27 august in a steady rain , destroyed the allied left flank , and won an impressive tactical victory despite desperate charges by the russian and prussian cavalry , this flank was also driven back the french center was held by marmont 's vi corps but the center was largely limited to an artillery duel by about 5:00pm , the entire allied force had to slowly pull back even though schwarzenberg 's powerful reserves had not been committed napoleon did not realize that they had left until the following morning this advance by vandamme ran into the midst of the allied forces withdrawing from dresden and resulted in the battle of kulm three days later
