prior to the sabre , napier had been working on large aero engines for some time their most famous was the lion , which had been a very successful engine between the world wars and in modified form had powered several of the supermarine schneider trophy competitors in 1923 and 1927 , as well as several land speed record cars in these new designs , napier chose air cooling but in service , the rear cylinders proved to be impossible to cool properly , which made the engines unreliable a typical large engine of the era , the pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp , developed about 1,200 & nbsp ; hp ( 895 & nbsp ; kw ) from 1,830 cubic inches ( 30 litres ) , so an advance of some 50 percent would be needed in it , he wrote that traditional poppet valve engines would be unlikely to produce much more than 1,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,100 & nbsp ; kw ) , a figure that many companies were eyeing for next generation engines engines and enterprise : the life and work of sir harry ricardo , john reynolds,1999 , p.187 the napier company decided first to develop a large 24 cylinder liquidâ€“cooled engine , capable of producing at least 2,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,491 & nbsp ; kw ) in late 1935 although the company continued with the opposed h layout of the dagger , this new design positioned the cylinder blocks horizontally and it was to use sleeve valves the air ministry supported the sabre programme with a development order in 1937 for two reasons : to provide an alternative engine if the rolls-royce vulture and the bristol centaurus failed as the next generation of high power engines and to keep napier in the aero-engine industry industry and air power the expansion of british aircraft production 1935-1941 , sebastian ritchie 2007 , routledge taylor and francis group , , p.140 the first sabre engines were ready for testing in january 1938 , although they were limited to 1,350 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,000 & nbsp ; kw ) by march , they were passing tests at 2,050 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,500 & nbsp ; kw ) and by june 1940 , when the sabre passed the air ministry 's 100-hour test , the first production versions were delivering 2,200 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,640 & nbsp ; kw ) from their 2,238 cubic inch ( 37 litre ) displacements by the end of the year , they were producing 2,400 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,800 & nbsp ; kw ) the sleeves often failed due to the way they were manufactured from chrome-molybdenum steel , leading to seized cylinders , which caused the loss of the sole prototype martin-baker mb 3 the ministry of aircraft production was responsible for the development of the engine and arranged for sleeves to be machined by the bristol aeroplane company from their taurus engine forgings in 1944 , rolls-royce produced a similar design prototype called the eagle in 1942 , it started a series of projects to improve its high-altitude performance , with the addition of a three-speed , two-stage supercharger , when the basic engine was still not running reliably in december 1942 , the company was purchased by the english electric , which ended the supercharger project immediately and devoted the whole company to solving the production problems , which was achieved quickly by 1944 , the sabre v was delivering 2,400 horsepower ( 1,800 & nbsp ; kw ) consistently and the reputation of the engine started to improve without the advanced supercharger , the engine 's performance over fell off rapidly and pilots flying sabre-powered aircraft , were generally instructed to enter combat only below this altitude the tempest became the principal destroyer of the v-1 flying bomb ( fieseler fi 103 ) , since it was the fastest of all the allied fighters at low levels development continued and the later sabre vii delivered 3,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 2,600 & nbsp ; kw ) with a new supercharger the final test engines delivered 5,500 & nbsp ; hp setright p.134 ( 4,100 & nbsp ; kw ) at 45 & nbsp ; lb/in 2 boost by the end of world war ii , there were several engines in the same power class the pratt & whitney r-4360 wasp major four-row , 28-cylinder radial produced 3,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 2,280 & nbsp ; kw ) at first and later types produced 3,800 & nbsp ; hp ( 2,834 & nbsp ; kw ) , but these required almost twice the displacement in order to do so , 4,360 cubic inches ( 71 litres ) as mk va with hobson fuel injection : preliminary flight development engine for sabre v series the engine has been used in multiple aircraft , including the two widely deployed fighters allied aircraft piston engines of world war ii : history and development of frontline aircraft piston engines produced by great britain and the united states during world war ii napier power heritage trust site cutaway illustration of a napier sabre drawn by max millar ( uncredited ) and coloured in by makoto oiuchi the sabre-powered napier-heston racer the hawker tempest page the greatest engines of all time napier sabre 3000 b.h.p a 1946 flight advertisement for the sabre engine
