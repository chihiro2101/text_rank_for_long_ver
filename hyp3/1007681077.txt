a history of the amistad captives : being a circumstantial account of the capture of the spanish schooner amistad , by the africans on board ; their voyage , and capture near long island , new york ; with biographical sketches of each of the surviving africans also , an account of the trials had on their case , before the district and circuit courts of the united states , for the district of connecticut , p taking them to the long island sound port of new london , connecticut , he presented officials with a written claim for his property rights under international admiralty law for salvage of the vessel , the cargo , and the africans gedney allegedly chose to land in connecticut because slavery was still technically legal there , under the state 's gradual abolition law , unlike in nearby new york state the united states district court for the district of connecticut , representing the spanish government , libelled that the '' slaves '' , cargo , and vessel be returned to spain as its property 589 the africans denied that they were slaves or property , and argued that the court could not '' return '' them to the control of the government of spain as the british had entered into a treaty with spain prohibiting the slave trade south of the equator , they considered it a matter of international law that the united states release the africans while the legal battle continued , richard robert madden , '' who served on behalf of the british commission to suppress the african slave trade in havana , '' arrived to testify he made a deposition '' that some twenty-five thousand slaves were brought into cuba every year â€“ with the wrongful compliance of , and personal profit by , spanish officials '' madden also '' told the court that his examinations revealed that the defendants were brought directly from africa and could not have been residents of cuba , '' as the spanish had claimed he said that the question of whether the '' negroes of the amistad '' had been enslaved in violation of the treaty was still an open one , '' and this government would with great reluctance erect itself into a tribunal to investigate such questions between two friendly sovereigns he suggested that if the court found for spanish rights of property , the africans would be returned to cuba at that point , great britain and spain could argue their questions of law and treaties between them secretary of state forsyth requested from the spanish minister , chevalier de argaiz , '' a copy of the laws now in force in the island of cuba relative to slavery '' in response , the captain general of cuba sent argaiz '' everything on the subject , which had been determined since the treaty concluded in 1818 between spain and england '' the spanish maintained that none but a spanish court could have jurisdiction over the case the spanish minister stated '' i do not , in fact , understand how a foreign court of justice can be considered competent to take cognizance of an offence committed on board of a spanish vessel , by spanish subjects , and against spanish subjects , in the waters of a spanish territory ; for it was committed on the coasts of this island , and under the flag of this nation '' other american sailors had protested this and when the american ambassador raised the issue with the spaniards , on march 20 , 1839 '' her majesty , having taken into consideration all the circumstances , decided that the said seamen should be placed at the disposition of the american consul , seeing that the offence was committed in one of the vessels and under the flag of his nation , and not on shore it was up to spanish courts to determine '' whether the negroes in question '' were legal or illegal slaves under spanish law , '' but never can this right justly belong to a foreign country '' the spaniards pointed out that by american law the jurisdiction over a vessel on the high seas , in time of peace , engaged in a lawful voyage , is , according to the laws of nations , under the exclusive jurisdiction of the state to which her flag belongs ; as much so as if constituting a part of its own domain they protested when judge william jay construed a statement by their minister as seeming to demand '' the surrender of the negroes apprehended on board the schooner amistad , as murderers , and not as property ; that is to say founding his demand on the law of nations , and not on the treaty of 1795 '' the spanish pointed out that the statement jay was referring to was one where the spanish minister was '' speaking of the crime committed by the negroes slave revolt , and the punishment which they merit '' judge jay took issue with the spanish minister 's request that the africans be turned over to spanish authorities ( which seemed to imply that they were fugitives instead of misbehaving property ) , because the 1795 treaty said that property should be restored directly to the control of its owners constitution , which would put the clauses of the treaty above the state laws of connecticut or new york , where the ship had been taken into custody , '' no one who respects the laws of the country ought to oppose the execution of the treaty , which is the supreme law of the country the spanish also sought to avoid talk about the law of nations , as some of their opponents argued that america had a duty under the law of nations to treat the africans with the same deference they would accord any other foreign sailors john quincy adams later argued this issue before the supreme court in 1841 , saying , the africans were in possession , and had the presumptive right of ownership ; they were in peace with the united states : the ship was theirs , and being in immediate communication with the shore , was in the territory of the state of new york ; or , if not , at least half the number were actually on the soil of new york , and entitled to all the provisions of the law of nations , and the protection and comfort which the laws of that state secure to every human being within its limits the court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction , because the alleged acts took place on a spanish ship in spanish waters various parties filed property claims with the district court to many of the african captives , to the ship , and to its cargo : ruiz and montez , lieutenant gedney , and captain henry green ( who had met the africans while on shore on long island and claimed to have helped in their capture ) their arrest in new york city in october 1839 had outraged pro-slavery rights advocates and the spanish government '' the spanish held that the bailbonds that the men had to acquire ( so that they could leave jail and return to cuba ) caused them a grave financial burden , and '' by the treaty of 1795 , no obstacle or impediment to leave the u.s 590 the abolitionists ' main argument before the district court was that a treaty between britain and spain of 1817 and a subsequent pronouncement by the spanish government had outlawed the slave trade across the atlantic he ordered the schooner uss grampus to new haven harbor to return the africans to cuba immediately after a favorable decision , before any appeals could be decided it ordered that the captives be delivered to the custody of the president of the united states for transportation to africa , since they were , in fact , legally free he challenged every part of the district court 's ruling except the concession of the slave antonio to the spanish vice-consul gilpin contended that if the africans were slaves ( as evidenced by the documents ) , then they must be returned to their rightful owner , in this case , the spanish government he argued that the spanish government sought the return of slaves who had been freed by the district court ; but the spanish government was not appealing the fact of their having been freed adams said that did not apply either , since the precedent was established prior to the prohibition of the foreign slave trade by the united states 597 when la amistad anchored near long island , however , the court believed it to be in the possession of the africans on board , who had never intended to become slaves the amistad committee instructed the africans in english and christianity , and raised funds to pay for their return home however , steele soon found that the amistad captives belonged to seven different tribes , some at war with one another in the following years , the spanish government continued to press the us for compensation for the ship , cargo , and slaves several southern lawmakers introduced resolutions into the united states congress to appropriate money for such payment but failed to gain passage , although it was supported by presidents james k 10 ( october 2009 ) in the creole case of 1841 , the united states dealt with another ship rebellion similar to that of the amistad by international law of the seas , ships and property found helpless at sea were subject to claims ( salvage rights for property ) made by those who rescued them
