after studying at leeds grammar school he joined his father 's law firm , but left to become a mathematical instrument maker ( working with henry hindley ) , developing , among other instruments , a pyrometer to study material expansion his 1759 paper '' an experimental enquiry concerning the natural powers of water and wind to turn mills and other machines depending on circular motion '' addressed the relationship between pressure and velocity for objects moving in air ( smeaton noted that the table doing so was actually contributed by '' my friend mr rouse '' '' an ingenious gentleman of harborough , leicestershire '' and calculated on the basis of rouse 's experiments ) , and his concepts were subsequently developed to devise the 'smeaton coefficient' in his 1759 paper '' an experimental enquiry concerning the natural powers of water and wind to turn mills and other machines depending on circular motion '' smeaton developed the concepts and data which became the basis for the smeaton coefficient , the lift equation used by the wright brothers image : smeaton 's lighthouse00.jpg thumb right smeaton 's lighthouse smeaton is important in the history , rediscovery of , and development of modern cement , identifying the compositional requirements needed to obtain '' hydraulicity '' in lime ; work which led ultimately to the invention of portland cement portland cement led to the re-emergence of concrete as a modern building material , largely due to smeaton 's influence the project is now known informally as '' smeaton 's harbour '' , but despite the name his involvement was limited and occurred more than 30 years after work on the harbour commenced this bell , built for the hexham bridge project , was not intended for underwater work , but in 1790 the design was updated to enable it to be used underwater on the breakwater at ramsgate harbour based on his concepts and data , it was used by the wright brothers in their pursuit of the first successful heavier-than-air aircraft he is also commemorated at the university of plymouth , where the mathematics and technology department is housed in a building named after him structure details : chimney mill smeaton 's profile at the bbc john smeaton : the aviation history online museum john smeaton 's model for the foundation of the eddystone lighthouse ( leeds museums and galleries '' secret life of objects '' blog ) john smeaton a narrative of the building and a description of the construction of the edystone lighthouse ( 1791 and 1793 editions ) â€“ linda hall library
