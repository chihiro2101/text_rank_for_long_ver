the chips were widely criticized in product reviews for not offering the performance suggested by their names , and for the confusion caused by their naming similarity with intel 's sl line and ibm 's slc line of cpus , neither of which was related to cyrix 's slc like intel 's pentium overdrive , the cyrix 5x86 used a 32-bit external data bus this processor continued the cyrix tradition of making faster replacements for intel designed sockets while the 6x86 quickly gained a following among computer enthusiasts and independent computer shops , unlike amd , its chips had yet to be used by a major oem customer this potential speed boost would have benefited not just cyrix 's users , but also users of amd 's k5 and especially of the 486 this bias in favor of the pentium served to boost the popularity of intel 's pentium cpus amongst the computer game community the cyrix mii , based on the 6x86mx design , was little more than a name change intended to help the chip compete better with the pentium ii in 1996 , cyrix released the mediagx cpu , which integrated all of the major discrete components of a pc , including sound and video , onto one chip because the 6x86 was more efficient on an instructions per cycle basis than intel 's pentium , and because cyrix sometimes used a faster bus speed than either intel or amd , cyrix and competitor amd co-developed the controversial performance rating ( pr ) system in an effort to compare their products more favorably with intel 's the pr nomenclature was controversial because while cyrix 's chips generally outperformed intel 's when running productivity applications , on a clock-for-clock basis its chips were slower for floating point operations , so the pr system performed more poorly when running the newest games additionally , since the 6x86 's price encouraged its use in budget systems , performance could drop even further when compared with pentium systems that were using faster hard drives , video cards , sound cards , and modems although amd also used the pr numbers for its early k5 chips , it soon abandoned that nomenclature with the introduction of the k6 however , it would use a similar concept in marketing its later cpus , starting again with the athlon xp as part of the manufacturing agreement between the two companies , ibm received the right to build and sell cyrix-designed cpus under the ibm name while some in the industry speculated this would lead to ibm using 6x86 cpus extensively in its product line and improve cyrix 's reputation , ibm continued to mostly use intel cpus , and to a lesser extent , amd cpus , in the majority of its products and only used the cyrix designs in a few budget models , mostly sold outside of the united states ibm instead sold its 6x86 chips on the open market , competing directly against cyrix and sometimes undercutting cyrix 's prices cyrix 's designs were the result of meticulous in-house reverse engineering , and often made significant advances in the technology while still being socket compatible with intel 's products thus , while amd 's 386s and even 486s had some intel-written microcode software , cyrix 's designs were completely independent since the manufacture of ram and cpus are similar , industry analysts at the time believed the marriage made sense the merger also resulted in a change of emphasis : national semiconductor 's priority was single-chip budget devices like the mediagx , rather than higher-performance chips like the 6x86 and mii whether national semiconductor doubted cyrix 's ability to produce high-performance chips or feared competing with intel at the high end of the market is open to debate by 1999 , amd and intel were leapfrogging one another in clock speeds , reaching 450 & nbsp ; mhz and beyond , while cyrix took almost a year to push the mii from pr-300 to pr-333 national semiconductor distanced itself from the cpu market , and without direction , the cyrix engineers left one by one via used the cyrix name on a chip designed by centaur technology , since via believed cyrix had better name recognition than centaur , or possibly even via although the company was short-lived and the brand name is no longer actively used by its current owner , cyrix 's competition with intel created the market for budget cpus , which cut the average selling price of pcs and ultimately forced intel to release its celeron line of budget processors and cut the prices of its faster processors more quickly in order to compete additionally , the acquisition of cyrix 's intellectual property and agreements would be used by via technologies to defend itself from its own legal troubles with intel , even after via stopped using the cyrix name
