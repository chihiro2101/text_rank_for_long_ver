this led to lawson 's resignation as chancellor ; he was replaced by former treasury chief secretary john major who , with douglas hurd , the then foreign secretary , convinced the cabinet to sign britain up to the erm in october 1990 , effectively guaranteeing that the british government would follow an economic and monetary policy preventing the exchange rate between the pound and other member currencies from fluctuating by more than 6 % in 1989 , the uk had inflation three times the rate of germany , higher interest rates at 15 % , and much lower labour productivity than france and germany , which indicated the uk 's different economic state in comparison to other erm countries the uk and italy had additional difficulties with their double deficits , while the uk was also hurt by the rapid depreciation of the united states dollar – a currency in which many british exports were priced – that summer in the wake of the rejection of the maastricht treaty by the danish electorate in a referendum in the spring of 1992 , and an announcement that there would be a referendum in france as well , those erm currencies that were trading close to the bottom of their erm bands came under pressure from foreign exchange traders in the months leading up to black wednesday , among many other currency traders , george soros had been building a huge short position in pounds sterling that would become immensely profitable if the pound fell below the lower band of the erm the uk government attempted to prop up the depreciating pound to avoid withdrawal from the monetary system the country had joined only two years earlier however , the bank of england only accepted orders during the trading day the bank of england continued to buy , and traders continued to sell , until lamont told prime minister john major that their pound purchasing was failing to produce results at 10:30 am on 16 september , the british government announced an increase in the base interest rate , from an already high 10 % , to 12 % to tempt speculators to buy pounds despite this and a promise later the same day to raise base rates again to 15 % , dealers kept selling pounds , convinced that the government would not keep its promise by 7:00 that evening , lamont announced britain would leave the erm and rates would remain at the new level of 12 % ; however , on the next day the interest rate was back to 10 % the effect of the low german interest rates , and high british interest rates , had arguably put britain into recession as large numbers of businesses failed and the housing market crashed while many people in the uk recall black wednesday as a national disaster that permanently affected the country 's international prestige , some conservatives claim that the forced ejection from the erm was a '' golden wednesday '' or '' white wednesday '' , the day that paved the way for an economic revival , with the conservatives handing tony blair 's new labour a much stronger economy in 1997 than had existed in 1992 as the new economic policy swiftly devised in the aftermath of black wednesday led to re-establishment of economic growth with falling unemployment and inflation
