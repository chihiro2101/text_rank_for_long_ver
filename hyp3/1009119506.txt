it has also been suggested , but not proved , that the red riesling of riesling is the forerunner of the common , '' white '' riesling 91 however , riesling 's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging michael broadbent , vintage wines little , brown 2002 pg 343 sweet riesling wines , such as german trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation however , high quality dry or off-dry riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years more common aging periods for riesling wines would be 5–15 years for dry , 10–20 years for semi-sweet and 10–30+ for sweet versions on release , certain riesling wines reveal a striking petrol note owen bird , rheingold - the german wine renaissance , arima publishing 2005 , pp the negative attitude to petrol aromas in young riesling , and the preference for fruitier young wines of this variety , seem more common in germany than in alsace or on the export market , and some german producers , especially the volume-oriented ones , have even gone so far as to consider the petrol notes a defect which they try to avoid , even at the cost of producing wines that are less suited to extended cellar aging in that vein , the german wine institute has gone so far as to omit the mentioning of '' petrol '' as a possible aroma on their german-language wine aroma wheel , which is supposed to be specially adapted to german wines , and despite the fact that professor ann c , low yields and late harvest high sun exposure water stress , which is most likely in regions which do not practice irrigation , and there primarily in certain dry vineyard sites in hot and dry years high acid content these factors are usually also considered to contribute to high quality riesling wines , so the petrol note is in fact more likely to develop in top wines than in simpler wines made from high-yielding vineyards , especially those from the new world , where irrigation is common the most expensive wines made from riesling are late harvest dessert wines , produced by letting the grapes hang on the vines well past normal picking time these elements combine to make wines which are amongst the most long lived of all white wines permission from the abbey of fulda ( which owned the vineyard ) to start picking riesling grapes arrived too late and the grapes had begun to rot ; yet it turned out that the wine made from them was still of excellent quality riesling is considered one of the grape varieties that best expresses the terroir of the place where it is grown today riesling is germany ’ s leading grape variety , known for its characteristic “ transparency ” in flavour and presentation of terroir , andrew ellson , roll out the riesling , german wines are making a comeback , in : the times dated 9 december 2019 two common characteristics of german riesling are that they are rarely blended with other varieties and usually never exposed to oak flavour ( despite some vintners fermenting in '' traditionel '' old oak barrels already leached ) in germany , sugar levels at time of harvest are an important consideration in the wine 's production with prädikat levels measuring the sweetness of the wine according to local tradition , in the mosel region the wine would then be bottled in tall , tapered , and green hock bottles similar bottles , although brown , are used for riesling produced in the rhine region riesling wines from germany cover a vast array of tastes from sweet to off-dry halbtrocken to dry trocken the other differences come in wine making styles , with the alsatian preferring more french-oriented methods that produce wines of higher alcohol content ( normally around 12 % ) and more roundness due to longer time spent in neutral oak barrels or steel tanks in contrast to german wine laws , alsatian rieslings can be chaptalized , a process in which the alcoholic content is increased through the addition of sugar to the must in contrast to other alsatian wines , rieslings d'alsace are usually not meant to be drunk young , but many are still best in the first years this is beneficial since the flavours in an alsace wine will often open up after three years , developing softer and fruitier flavours riesling was the most planted white grape in australia until the early 1990s when chardonnay greatly increased in popularity the warmer australian climate produces thicker skinned grapes , sometimes seven times the thickness of german grown grape in comparison to australian riesling , new zealand produces lighter and more delicate wines that range from sweet to dry home of cool climate wines , central otago , has recently emerged as another area producing terroir driven wines the wine can be dynamic though rarely robust , and ranges from dry to sweet new york is also a notable producer of riesling-based ice wine , although a large majority of new york ice wine is made from vidal blanc and vignoles a notable exception is the growing development of high quality late harvest dessert wines the riesling that does come out of california tends to be softer , fuller , and having more diverse flavours than a '' typical '' german riesling late harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with riesling in niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production this clone and niagara 's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions in british columbia , riesling is commonly grown for use in icewine , table wine , and sekt style sparkling wines , a notable example of which is cipes brut a wine that is best at its '' freshest '' states , the grapes and juice may be chilled often throughout the vinification process ) riesling is often put through a process of cold stabilization , where the wine is stored just above its freezing point in viticulture , the two main components in growing riesling grapes are to keep it '' long & low '' meaning that the ideal situation for riesling is a climate that allows for a long , slow ripening and proper pruning to keep the yield low and the flavor concentrated a riesling 's typical aromas are of flowers , tropical fruits , and mineral stone ( such as slate or quartz ) , although , with time , the wine acquires a petrol note as mentioned above riesling is almost never fermented or aged in new oak ( although large old oak barrels are often used to store and stabilize riesling-based wines in germany and alsace ) as with other white wines , dry riesling is generally served at a cool , it is still a white wine grape in the late 19th century german horticulturalists devoted many efforts to develop new riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible , less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant characteristics of riesling schwarzriesling ( black riesling ) is the german name for pinot meunier , a grape used in champagne , but which is also grown in southern germany
