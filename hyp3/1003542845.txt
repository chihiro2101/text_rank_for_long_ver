while the united nations had dreamed of constructing an independent city for its new world capital , multiple obstacles soon forced the organization to downsize their plans niemeyer 's project 32 was finally chosen , but as opposed to corbusier 's project 23 , which consisted of one building containing both the assembly hall and the councils in the center of the site ( as it was hierarchically the most important building ) , niemeyer 's plan split the councils from the assembly hall , locating the first alongside the river , and the second on the right side of the secretariat this would not split the site , but on the contrary , would create a large civic square this plan included a public plaza as well '' together , they submitted the scheme 23–32 , which was built and is what can be seen today many cities vied for the honor of hosting the un headquarters site , prior to the selection of new york city the selection of the east river site came after over a year of protracted study and consideration of many sites in the united states their determined courtship of the un interim site committee resulted in the early meetings taking place at multiple locations throughout the new york area the un and many of its delegates seriously considered philadelphia for the headquarters ; the city offered to donate land in several select sites , including fairmount park , andorra , and a center city location which would have placed the headquarters along a mall extending from independence hall to penn 's landing after the un moved to its new manhattan headquarters , the building was remodeled and briefly used as a pavilion for the 1964 new york world 's fair , after which it reverted to use as a skating rink until 2008 , when the entire building began a long-term renovation to create expanded museum facilities per an agreement with the city , the buildings met some but not all local fire safety and building codes to save money , the un considered retaining an existing building on the manhattan site , which had been slated for demolition once the headquarters was completed the headquarters were originally supposed to be completed in 1951 , with the first occupants moving into the secretariat building in 1950 however , in november , new york city 's construction coordinator robert moses reported that construction was two months behind schedule two days after this announcement , workers erected the first steel beam for the secretariat building , to little official fanfare the project also included a four-lane , 2.28 & nbsp ; million vehicular tunnel under first avenue so that traffic could bypass the headquarters when the un was in session in october 1949 , contracts were awarded for the construction of two vehicular ramps over the fdr drive : one to the north of the un headquarters , and one to the south another contract to redevelop 42nd street , a major corridor leading to the un headquarters , was awarded in december of that year the installation of the secretariat building 's interior furnishings proceeded quickly so that the building could be open in january 1951 a 1.7 & nbsp ; million steel contract on the united nations general assembly building , the last structure to be built , was awarded in april 1950 in december 1949 , robert moses proposed placing a playground inside the un headquarters , but this plan was initially rejected the un subsequently reversed its position in april 1951 , and lie agreed to build a playground at the northeast corner of the headquarters site however , the un did reject an unusual '' model playground '' proposal for that site , instead choosing to construct a play area similar to others found around new york city the first 450 un employees started working at the secretariat building on august 22 , 1950 the united nations officially moved into the secretariat building on january 8 , 1951 , by which time 3,300 employees occupied the building at the time , much of the secretariat building was still unfinished , and the bulk of the un 's operations still remained at lake success the un had completely moved out of its lake success headquarters by may a new library building for the un headquarters was proposed in 1952 the nycha building could only hold 170,000 books , whereas the un wanted to host at least 350,000 to 400,000 books in its library by 1955 , the collection was housed in the secretariat building and held 250,000 volumes in '' every language of the world '' , according to the new york times the gardens at the united nations headquarters were originally closed to the public , but were made publicly accessible in 1958 by 1962 , the united nations ' operations had grown so much that the headquarters could not house all of the organization 's operations as a result , the un announced its intention to rent office space nearby this plan was presented to the new york city government in 1969 , but was ultimately not acted upon it also announced its intention to build a new storage building between 41st and 42nd streets the renovations , which were the first since the complex opened in 1950 , were expected to take about 7 years to complete a temporary 140 & nbsp ; million '' north lawn building '' was built to house the united nations ' '' critical operations '' while renovations proceeded the renovation of the secretariat building was completed , and the un staff moved into the new building in july 2012 in 2005 , officials investigated establishing a new temporary site be created at the old lake success location brooklyn was also suggested as a temporary site another alternative for a temporary headquarters or a new permanent facility was the world trade center site once again , these plans met resistance both within the un and from the united states and new york governments and were abandoned journalists reporting from the complex often use '' united nations '' rather than '' new york city '' as the identification of their location in recognition of the extraterritoriality status however , only contacts made with the un headquarters in new york , and the itu count as separate entities other un organizations such as the world bank count for the state or country they are located in while the secretariat building is most predominantly featured in depictions of the headquarters , it also includes the domed general assembly building , the dag hammarskjöld library , as well as the conference and visitors center , which is situated between the general assembly and secretariat buildings , and can be seen only from the fdr drive or the east river original plans called for the back wall of the general assembly hall , behind the rostrum , to be adorned with the seals of the sixty countries that were part of the un in 1952 it was originally called the united nations library , later the united nations international library in the late 1950s the ford foundation gave a grant to the united nations for the construction of a new library building ; dag hammarskjöld was also instrumental in securing the funding for the new building while outside of the complex , the headquarters also includes two large office buildings that serve as offices for the agencies and programmes of the organization there is also an identification office at the corner of 46th street , inside a former bank branch , where pre-accredited diplomats , reporters , and others receive their grounds passes in october 2011 city and state officials announced an agreement in which the un would be allowed to build a long-sought new office tower just south of the existing campus on the current robert moses playground , which would be relocated due to the significance of the organization , proposals to relocate its headquarters have occasionally been made the closest location where the new york city police department usually allows demonstrators is dag hammarskjöld plaza at 47th street and first avenue , one block away from the visitors ' entrance , four blocks away from the entrance used by top-level diplomats , and five blocks away from the general staff entrance after the action within the building , another scene shows grant leaving across the plaza looking down from the building 's roof un visitors centre un : building an international headquarters in new york – historical overview , on the un 60th anniversary webpage agreement establishing the un headquarters – with information on legal status
