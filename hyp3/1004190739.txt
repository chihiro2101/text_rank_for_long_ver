the earliest known written mention of the philosophers ' stone is in the cheirokmeta by zosimos of panopolis ( c the legend of the stone was also compared to the biblical history of the temple of solomon and the rejected cornerstone described in psalm 118 p.19 the theoretical roots outlining the stone 's creation can be traced to greek philosophy alchemists later used the classical elements , the concept of anima mundi , and creation stories presented in texts like plato 's timaeus as analogies for their process according to plato , the four elements are derived from a common source or prima materia ( first matter ) , associated with chaos prima materia is also the name alchemists assign to the starting ingredient for the creation of the philosophers ' stone a leading opponent was the persian polymath avicenna ( ibn sina ) , who discredited the theory of transmutation of substances , stating , '' those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances , though they can produce the appearance of such change paracelsus believed that this element was , in fact , the philosopher 's stone the english philosopher sir thomas browne in his spiritual testament religio medici ( 1643 ) identified the religious aspect of the quest for the philosopher 's stone when declaring : a mystical text published in the 17th century called the mutus liber appears to be a symbolic instruction manual for concocting a philosopher 's stone the yoga vasistha , originally written in the 10th century ad , contains a story about the philosophers ' stone a great hindu sage wrote about the spiritual accomplishment of gnosis using the metaphor of the philosophers ' stone saint jnaneshwar ( 1275â€“1296 ) wrote a commentary with 17 references to the philosopher 's stone that explicitly transmutes base metal into gold numerous synonyms were used to make oblique reference to the stone , such as '' white stone '' ( calculus albus , identified with the calculus candidus of revelation 2:17 which was taken as a symbol of the glory of heaven salomon glass , johann gottfried olearius , philologia sacra : qua totius vet many of the medieval allegories for a christ were adopted for the lapis , and the christ and the stone were indeed taken as identical in a mystical sense the name of '' stone '' or lapis itself is informed by early christian allegory , such as priscillian ( 4th century ) , who stated , in some texts it is simply called 'stone ' , or our stone , or in the case of thomas norton 's ordinal , '' oure delycious stone '' the early english text society no john read '' from alchemy to chemistry '' p.29 according to alchemical texts , the stone of the philosophers came in two varieties , prepared by an almost identical method : white ( for the purpose of making silver ) , and red ( for the purpose of making gold ) , the white stone being a less matured version of the red stone a tract of great price concerning the philosophical stone some ancient and medieval alchemical texts leave clues to the physical appearance of the stone of the philosophers , specifically the red stone the various names and attributes assigned to the philosophers ' stone has led to long-standing speculation on its composition and source alchemists once thought a key component in the creation of the stone was a mythical element named carmot new interpretations continue to be developed around spagyric , chemical , and esoteric schools of thought his analysis is based in part on a linguistic interpretation through arabic equivalents of one of the terms for the stone ( azoth ) as well as for sulfur , salt and mercury the philosophers ' stone is created by the alchemical method known as the magnum opus or the great work often expressed as a series of color changes or chemical processes , the instructions for creating the philosopher 's stone are varied
