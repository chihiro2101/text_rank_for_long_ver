once junot realised that british troops occupied the ridge , he sent solignac 's brigade to the right to assist brenier 's attack the french commander decided to launch his attack on the town immediately , instead of waiting for his flanking move to develop first , thomi√®res ' 2,100-man brigade approached the british position the first company of 120 men formed in a three-deep line would have a front rank 40 men wide on the other hand , french commanders often pressed home attacks while in column , depending entirely upon their skirmishers and artillery to provide the necessary fire support before they could deploy , the french were taken in flank by a second battalion the first two battalions attacked the same area as the previous units and were thrown back they soon came up against margaron 's french cavalry division and were routed in their turn if the french intended to form into line once the enemy position was detected , they waited too long at first they enjoyed success when they surprised and drove back two british battalions victorious , the french pressed on in column , but soon ran into the 29th regiment in line and were stopped together , the volley fire of the three british battalions soon routed brenier 's men two of wellesley 's brigades never got into action , but the rest were used economically to defeat each french attack under the terms of the convention of sintra , the defeated army was transported back to france by the british navy , complete with its guns and equipment and the loot it had taken from portugal
