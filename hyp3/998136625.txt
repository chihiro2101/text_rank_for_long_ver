finally , managing the nervous systems in both the body and the head is essential , in several ways of these challenges , dealing with blood supply and transplant rejection have been addressed in the field of transplant medicine generally , making transplantation of several types of organs fairly routine ; however in a field as common as liver transplantation around a quarter of organs are rejected within the first year and overall mortality is still much higher than the general population in 1954 , vladimir demikhov , a soviet surgeon who had done important work to improve coronary bypass surgery , performed an experiment in which he grafted a dog 's head and upper body including the front legs , onto another dog ; the effort was focused on how to provide blood supply to the donor head and upper body and not on grafting the nervous systems there were few animal experiments on head transplantation for many years after this in 2012 , xiaoping ren published work in which he grafted the head of a mouse onto another mouse 's body ; again the focus was on how to avoid harm from the loss of blood supply ; with his protocol the grafted heads survived up to six months in 2015 , ren published work in which he cut off the heads of mice but left the brain stem in place , and then connected the vasculature of the donor head to the recipient body ; this work was an effort to address whether it was possible to keep the body of the recipient animal alive without life support all prior experimental work that involved removing the recipient body 's head had cut the head off lower down , just below axis ( anatomy ) in general the field of transplantation medicine has been met with resistance and alarm from some quarters as advances have been made ; joseph murray , who performed the first kidney transplant in 1954 , was described as doing something unnatural or as playing god these continued as other organs were transplanted , but perhaps became the most sharp as hand transplants and face transplants emerged in 1998 and 2005 , as each of these are visible , personal , and social in ways that internal organs are not with regard to societal costs , the body of a person willing to be an organ donor can save the lives of many people , and the supply of tissues and organs from people willing to be organ donors did not meet the medical need of recipients ; the notion of an entire donor body going to one other person was difficult to justify at that time basic legal issues were also unclear with regard to whether only one or both of the people involved in a head transplantation would have any legal rights in the post-procedure person because grafting the head onto the spinal cord was not possible at that time , the only feasible procedure would be one where the head was only connected to the blood supply of the donor body , leaving the person completely paralyzed , with the accompanying limited quality of life and high societal cost to maintain popular opinion about canavero 's plans for head transplantation had been generally negative
