since the fqis was operating on a single channel , a dripstick reading was taken to obtain a second measurement of fuel quantity since the fqis was not operational , he entered the reading into the flight management computer ( fmc ) , which tracked the amount of fuel remaining in kilograms the airplane flew to ottawa without incident , where another dripstick measurement was taken and converted using the density in pounds/litre since the aircraft appeared to have enough fuel to reach edmonton , no fuel was loaded at ottawa assuming that a fuel pump had failed , the pilots turned off the alarm , knowing that the engine could be gravity-fed in level flight within seconds , the left engine failed and the pilots began preparing for a single-engine landing flying with all engines out was something that was never expected to occur , so it had never been covered in training with both engines stopped , the system went dead and most of the screens went blank , leaving only a few basic battery-powered emergency flight instruments while these provided sufficient information to land the aircraft , the backup instruments did not include a vertical speed indicator that could be used to determine how far the aircraft could glide as the gimli pilots performed a partial side-slip manoeuvre ( forward slip ) to reduce altitude prior to landing , the disrupted airflow past the ram air turbine also meant a decrease in the hydraulic power available , and they were surprised to find the aircraft slow to respond when straightening after the forward-slip in line with their planned diversion to winnipeg , the pilots were already descending through accident description aviation-safety.net ( accessed july 24 , 2008 ) when the second engine shut down red river pca website without main power , the pilots used a gravity drop , which allows gravity to lower the landing gear and lock it into place as the plane drew near the runway , it became apparent that the aircraft was coming in too high and fast , raising the danger of the 767 running off the runway before it could be stopped this manoeuvre , performed by '' crossing the controls '' ( applying rudder in one direction and ailerons in the other direction ) is commonly used in gliders and light aircraft to descend more quickly without increasing forward speed , but it is practically never executed in large jet airliners outside of rare circumstances like those of this flight captain pearson would later remark that the boys were so close that he could see the looks of sheer terror on their faces as they realized that a large , passenger-laden aircraft was bearing down on them - the boeing 767 , was only classed as a medium-size airliner however when empty still weighed roughly 80 tonnes without passengers two factors helped avert disaster : the failure of the front landing gear to lock into position during the gravity drop , and the presence of a guardrail that had been installed along the centre of the repurposed runway to facilitate its use as a drag race track air canada flight 143 came to a final stop on the ground 17 minutes after running out of fuel '' it further found that the airline had failed to reallocate the task of checking fuel load ( which had been the responsibility of the flight engineer on older aircraft flown with a crew of three ) the safety board also said that air canada needed to keep more spare parts , including replacements for the defective fuel quantity indicator , in its maintenance inventory as well as provide better , more thorough training on the metric system to its pilots and fuelling personnel in the event of one failing , the other could still operate alone , but in that case , the indicated quantity was required to be cross-checked against a floatstick measurement before departure in the event of both channels failing , there would be no fuel display in the cockpit , and the aircraft would be considered non-serviceable and not authorized to fly the engineer had encountered the same problem earlier in the month when this same aircraft had arrived from toronto with an fqis fault a record of all actions and findings was made in the maintenance log , including the entry ; '' service chk – found fuel qty ind blank – fuel qty 2 c/b pulled & tagged this reports that the fuel gauges were blank and that the second fqis channel was disabled , but does not make clear that the latter fixed the former to test the system he re-enabled the second channel , at which point the fuel gauges in the cockpit went blank before he could disable the second channel again , however , he was called away to perform a floatstick measurement of fuel remaining in the tanks , leaving the circuit breaker tagged ( which masked the fact that it was no longer pulled ) pearson consulted the master minimum equipment list ( mmel ) , which indicated that the aircraft was not legal to fly with blank fuel gauges but due to a misunderstanding , pearson believed that it was safe to fly if the amount of fuel was confirmed with measuring sticks c-gaun was the 47th boeing 767 off the production line , and had been delivered to air canada less than four months previously to add to his own misconceptions about the condition in which the aircraft had been flying since the previous day , reinforced by what he saw in the cockpit , pearson now had a signed-off maintenance log that it had become custom to prefer over the mmel the fueler reported that the density of jet fuel at the time was 1.77 , which was in pounds/litre since other air canada aircraft used pounds ( the source contains two typos regarding the weight of fuel already on board : 6669 and 66169 , instead of the correct value of 6169 ) the flight management system ( fmc ) measures fuel consumption , allowing the crew to keep track of fuel burned as the flight progresses the captain knew '' from previous experience '' the density of jet fuel in kg/l following the full repair , the aircraft was returned to service with air canada
