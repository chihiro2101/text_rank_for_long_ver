the next major drop in price came about in the 1880s with the introduction of electricity in the form of arc lamp for large space and street lighting , followed by incandescent light bulb-based utilities for indoor and outdoor lighting the first form of electric light history of the carbon arc lamp ( 1800 - 1980s ) '.edison tech center , edisontechcenter.org over time , electric lighting became ubiquitous in developed countries segmented sleep patterns disappeared , improved nighttime lighting made more activities possible at night , and more street lights reduced urban crime the most important functions are as a holder for the light source , to provide directed light and to avoid visual glare nearly any material can be used , so long as it can tolerate the excess heat and is in keeping with safety codes an important property of light fixtures is the luminous efficacy or wall-plug efficiency , meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy , usually measured in lumen per watt a fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the '' bulb '' to the surroundings color temperature for white light sources also affects their use for certain applications for critical inspection or color matching tasks , or for retail displays of food and clothing , the color temperature of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect lighting is classified by intended use as general , accent , or task lighting , depending largely on the distribution of the light produced by the fixture task lighting is mainly functional and is usually the most concentrated , for purposes such as reading or inspection of materials for example , reading poor-quality reproductions may require task lighting levels up to 1500 lux ( 150 footcandles ) , and some inspection tasks or surgical procedures require even higher levels general lighting ( sometimes referred to as ambient light ) fills in between the two and is intended for general illumination of an area outdoors , general lighting for a parking lot may be as low as 10-20 lux ( 1-2 footcandles ) since pedestrians and motorists already used to the dark will need little light for crossing the area although it is easy to design , it has dramatic problems with glare and excess energy consumption due to large number of fittings uplighting is less common , often used to bounce indirect light off the ceiling and back down front lighting is also quite common , but tends to make the subject look flat as its casts almost no visible shadows lighting from the side is the less common , as it tends to produce glare near eye level this is often done with fluorescent lighting ( first available at the 1939 world 's fair ) or rope light , occasionally with neon lighting , and recently with led strip light the effect depends heavily on the exact type of lighting source used there are also downlights with internal reflectors designed to accept common ' a ' lamps ( light bulbs ) which are generally less costly than reflector lamps track lighting , invented by lightolier , was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting , and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall it has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks , which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have , and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves traditionally made up of small low wattage , low-voltage lamps in a track or translucent tube , these are rapidly being replaced with led based versions while lamps have traditionally been rated and marketed primarily in terms of their power consumption , expressed in watts , proliferation of lighting technology beyond the incandescent light bulb has eliminated the correspondence of wattage to the amount of light produced each of these technologies has a different efficacy in converting electrical energy to visible light roger fouquet , heat , power and light : revolutions in energy services , edward elgar publishing , 2008 , page 411 rating and marketing emphasis is shifting away from wattage and towards lumen output , to give the purchaser a directly applicable basis upon which to select a lamp lighting of structures considers aesthetic elements as well as practical considerations of quantity of light required , occupants of the structure , energy efficiency , and cost artificial lighting takes into account the amount of daylight received in a space by using daylight factor calculations for simple installations , hand calculations based on tabular data are used to provide an acceptable lighting design in some instances , the materials used on walls and furniture play a key role in the lighting effect stage lighting uses general illumination technology in devices configured for easy adjustment of their output characteristics a set of lighting cues are prepared so that the lighting operator can control the lights in step with the performance ; complex theatre lighting systems use computer control of lighting instruments motion picture and television production use many of the same tools and methods of stage lighting especially in the early days of these industries , very high light levels were required and heat produced by lighting equipment presented substantial challenges modern cameras require less light , and modern light sources emit less heat measurement of light or photometry is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source , along with the colors that can be rendered by this light the human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum , therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light in addition to these new methods , four main factors influence the degree of discomfort glare ; the luminance of the glare source , the solid angle of the glare source , the background luminance , and the position of the glare source in the field of view must all be taken into account to define light source color properties , the lighting industry predominantly relies on two metrics , correlated color temperature ( cct ) , commonly used as an indication of the apparent '' warmth '' or '' coolness '' of the light emitted by a source , and color rendering index ( cri ) , an indication of the light source 's ability to make objects appear natural however , these two metrics , developed in the last century , are facing increased challenges and criticisms as new types of light sources , particularly light emitting diodes ( leds ) , become more prevalent in the market in order to specifically measure the amount of light entering the eye , personal circadian light meter called the daysimeter has been developed this is the first device created to accurately measure and characterize light ( intensity , spectrum , timing , and duration ) entering the eye that affects the human body 's clock the small , head-mounted device measures an individual 's daily rest and activity patterns , as well as exposure to short-wavelength light that stimulates the circadian system the device measures activity and light together at regular time intervals and electronically stores and logs its operating temperature several strategies are available to minimize energy requirements for lighting a building : specification of illumination requirements for each given use area analysis of lighting quality to ensure that adverse components of lighting ( for example , glare or incorrect color spectrum ) are not biasing the design integration of space planning and interior architecture ( including choice of interior surfaces and room geometries ) to lighting design design of time of day use that does not expend unnecessary energy selection of fixtures and lamps that reflect best available technology for energy conservation training of building occupants to use lighting equipment in most efficient manner maintenance of lighting systems to minimize energy wastage use of natural light some big box stores were being built from 2006 on with numerous plastic bubble skylights , in many cases completely obviating the need for interior artificial lighting for many hours of the day clearly , much less light is required to illuminate a hallway compared to that needed for a word processing work station lighting control systems reduce energy usage and cost by helping to provide light only when and where it is needed passive infrared sensors react to changes in heat , such as the pattern created by a moving person they can be used to control one lamp , one fixture or many fixtures daylighting is simply designing a space to use as much natural light as possible in recent years light-emitting diode ( leds ) are becoming increasingly efficient leading to an extraordinary increase in the use of solid-state lighting it is valuable to provide the correct light intensity and color spectrum for each task or environment analysis of lighting quality particularly emphasizes use of natural lighting , but also considers spectral content if artificial light is to be used light in school buildings to incorporate the right types of light at the right time of day for the right duration may improve student performance and well-being in addition to increased work performance , proper usage of windows and daylighting crosses the boundaries between pure aesthetics and overall health conflated data , aggregated in the early 2000s , about the increased use of blue-white leds seemed to indicate that their use , while saving energy , may compromise human health for instance , one study conducted by the american medical association warned on the use of high blue content white leds in street lighting , due to their higher impact on human health and environment , compared to low blue content light sources ( e.g while that data may have been suspect even prior to publication , there ’ s no question that the solid state technology that are leds , has evolved substantially since then and we no longer use the lamps that were available for study at that time light pollution is a growing problem in reaction to excess light being given off by numerous signs , houses , and buildings well-designed lighting sends light only
