in 1876 , james starley developed the coventry lever tricycle , which used two small wheels on the right side and a large drive wheel on the left side ; power was supplied by hand levers rear wheel steering is sometimes used , although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling ( the geometry is similar to a regular tricycle operating in reverse , but with a steering damper added ) some early pedal tricycles from the late 19th century used two wheels in tandem on one side and a larger driving wheel on the other upright resembles a two-wheeled bicycle , traditionally diamond frame , or open frame , but with either two widely spaced wheels at the back ( called delta ) or two wheels at the front ( called tadpole ) one or both rear wheels can be driven , while the front is used for steering ( the usual layout ) even with the higher seat a delta trike can be quite stable provided most of the weight ( including the rider ) is shifted back towards the rear wheels many delta trikes place the seat too far forward and that takes weight off the two rear wheels and puts more weight onto the front wheel making the trike more unstable the hase kettwiesel delta trike has an high seat that is placed to put most of the weight onto the cambered rear wheels making it more stable recumbent tadpole or reverse trike is a recumbent design with two steered wheels at the front and one driven wheel at the back , though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers recumbent tandem trikes allow two people to ride in a recumbent position with an extra-strong backbone frame to hold the extra weight some recumbent tricycles are fully enclosed for all weather use as well as for aerodynamic benefits ; these are known as velomobiles most cycle rickshaws , used for carrying passengers for hire , are tricycles with one steering wheel in the front and two wheels in the back supporting a seating area for one or two passengers these are usually mounted over one or both wheels , low behind the front wheel , or between parallel wheels at either the front or rear of the vehicle , to keep the center of gravity low the frame and drivetrain must be constructed to handle loads several times that of an ordinary bicycle ; as such , extra low gears may be added the advantage of using freight trikes rather than a motor vehicle is that there is no exhaust , which means that the trike can be used inside warehouses tricycles are typically used by children between the ages of two and five , after which point they usually switch to a bicycle , often with training wheels ( stabilisers ) children 's trikes can have pedals directly driving the front wheels , allowing braking with the pedals , or they can use chain drive the rear wheels , often without a differential , so one rear wheel spins free with hand and foot trikes , the rider makes a pair of front wheels change directions by shifting the center of weight and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel tricycles have been constructed that tilt in the direction of a turn , as a bicycle does , to avoid rolling over without a wide axle track the advantages of a trike conversion set include lower cost compared with new hand built tricycles and the freedom to choose almost any donor bicycle frame tricycle conversion sets tend to be heavier than a high quality , hand built , sports , touring or racing tricycle in the case of delta tricycles , the drive is often to just one of the rear wheels , though in some cases both wheels are driven through a differential tadpoles generally use a bicycle 's rear wheel drive and for that reason are usually lighter , cheaper and easier to replace and repair tadpole trikes tend also to use ackermann steering geometry , perhaps with both front brakes operated by the stronger hand the center-of-mass of most tadpole trikes is close to the front wheels , making the rear brake less useful recumbent trikes often brake one wheel with each hand , allowing the rider to brake one side alone to pull the trike in that direction
