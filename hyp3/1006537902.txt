as early as 1915 , a number of b.e.2c aircraft ( the infamous '' fokker fodder '' ) were modified into the first night fighters to provide suitable equipment for home defence squadrons in the north of the uk , avro 504k trainers were converted to night fighters by removing the front cockpit and mounting a lewis gun on the top wing in the meantime , aircraft performance had improved tremendously ; compared to their first world war counterparts , modern bombers could fly about twice as fast , at over twice the altitude , with much greater bomb loads the widespread conclusion was that '' the bomber will always get through '' , and the royal air force invested almost all of their efforts in developing a night bomber force , with the central flying school responsible for one of the most important developments in the period by introducing '' blind flying '' training immediately prior to the opening of the war , radar was introduced operationally for the first time in september 1937 , he gave a working demonstration of the concept when a test aircraft was able to detect three home fleet capital ships in the north sea in bad weather the size of these early ai radars required a large aircraft to lift them , and their complex controls required a multiperson crew to operate them this naturally led to the use of light bombers as the preferred platform for airborne radars , and in may 1939 , the first experimental flight took place , on a fairey battle the war opened on 1 september 1939 , and by this time , the raf were well advanced with plans to build a radar – then called 'rdf ' in britain – equipped night-fighter fleet the first prototype system went into service in november 1939 , long before the opening of major british operations these early systems had significant practical problems , and while work was underway to correct these flaw , by the time the blitz opened in august 1940 , the night fighter fleet was still in its infancy through this period , the raf experimented with many other aircraft and interception methods in an effort to get a working night fighter force one attempt to make up for the small number of working radars was to fit an ai to a douglas havoc bomber which also carried a searchlight in its nose this coincided with the arrival of the beaufighter , which offered significantly higher performance than the pre-war blenheims ; it was the highest performance aircraft capable of carrying the bulky early airborne interception radars used for night fighter operations , and quickly became invaluable as a night fighter although night bombing never ended , its intensity was greatly decreased , giving the raf time to introduce the ai mk the british also experimented with mounting pilot-operated ai mark 6 radar sets in single-seat fighters , and the hurricane ii c ( nf ) , a dozen of which were produced in 1942 , became the first radar-equipped , single-seat night fighter in the world german airborne interception radar efforts at this point were about two years behind the british unlike in britain , where the major targets lay only a few minutes ' flight time from the coast , germany was defence of the reich that gave them long times to deal with intruding bombers by july 1940 , this system was well developed as the kammhuber line , and proved able to deal with the small raids by isolated bombers the raf was carrying out at the time this late date , and slow introduction , combined with the capture of a ju 88r-1 night fighter equipped with it in april 1943 when flown to raf dyce , scotland , by a defecting luftwaffe crew , allowed british radio engineers to develop jamming equipment to counter it the early lichtenstein b/c was replaced by the similar uhf-band lichtenstein c-1 , but when the german night fighter defected and landed in scotland in april 1943 , that radar was quickly jammed the low vhf-band sn-2 unit that replaced the c-1 remained relatively secure until july 1944 , but only at the cost of using huge , eight-dipole element hirschgeweih ( stag 's antlers ) antennae that slowed their fighters as much as 25 & nbsp ; mph , making them easy prey for british night fighters that had turned to the offensive role the capture in july 1944 of a ju 88g-1 night fighter of njg 2 equipped with an sn-2 lichtenstein set , flown by mistake into raf woodbridge , revealed the secrets of the later , longer-wavelength replacement for the earlier b/c and c-1 sets particularly in the initial stage of operational use until early 1944 , the sudden fire from below was often attributed to ground fire rather than a fighter heaton and lewis 2008 at the urging of the british , who were looking to purchase us-made aircraft , us day fighters were initially adapted to a night role , including the douglas p-70 and later lockheed p-38 lightning the only purpose-built night fighter design deployed during the war , the american northrop p-61 black widow was introduced first in europe and then saw action in the pacific , but it was given such a low priority that the british had ample supplies of their own designs by the time it was ready for production the first usaaf unit using the p-61 did not move to britain until february 1944 ; operational use did not start until the summer , and was limited throughout the war the japanese navy had long screened new recruits for exceptional night vision , using the best on their ships and aircraft instead of developing new equipment for this role even while the war raged , the jet engine so seriously upset aircraft design that the need for dedicated jet-powered night fighters became clear several me 262 pilots were able to attain a high number of kills in the type such as oberleutnant kurt welter , who claimed a total of 25 mosquitos downed during nighttime missions other forces did not have the pressing need to move to the jet engine ; britain and the us were facing enemies with aircraft of even lower performance than their existing night fighters however , the need for new designs was evident , and some low-level work started in the closing stages of the war , including the us contract for the northrop f-89 scorpion when the soviet plans to build an atomic bomb became known in the west in 1948 , this project was still long from being ready to produce even a prototype , and in march 1949 , they started development of both the north american f-86d sabre and lockheed f-94 starfire as stop-gap measures in the korean war , after the starfire proved to be ineffective against the latest soviet-supplied aircraft , marine corps douglas f3d skyknights shot down six aircraft , including five mikoyan-gurevich mig-15s without loss , as the mig-15s lacked radar to shoot down individual fighters , though they were effective against bomber formations at night by the time of the soviet bomb test , the night-fighter design was still strictly a paper project , and the existing mosquito fleet was generally unable to successfully intercept the tupolev tu-4 bomber it was expected to face a similar conversion of the de havilland vampire was also introduced ; this was originally developed by the company as a private venture and initially ordered by egypt , instead the raf took over the order to serve an interim measure between the retirement of the mosquito night fighter and the meteor night fighter 's introduction more advanced night fighter models of the venom would follow , birtles 1999 , pp into the 1960s , night fighters still existed as a separate class of aircraft however , as they continued to grow in capability , radar-equipped interceptors could take on the role of night fighters , thus the class went into decline . however , compared to early air-superiority designs such as the f-100 or f-8 , the massive phantom , nevertheless , had enough raw power from its twin j79 engines to prove adaptable as the preferred platform for tangling with agile mig-17 and mig-21 fighters over the skies of vietnam , dorr and bishop 1996 , pp in the us air force 's lightweight fighter program , the f-16 was originally envisaged as inexpensive day fighter , but quickly converted to an all-weather role
