monocrystalline silicon is also used in large quantities by the photovoltaic industry for the production of conventional mono-si solar cells the almost perfect crystal structure yields the highest light-to-electricity conversion efficiency for silicon by precisely controlling the temperature gradients , rate of pulling and speed of rotation , it is possible to extract a large , single-crystal , cylindrical ingot from the melt the crystals produced by this early apparatus , used in an early si plant , were only one inch in diameter due to efficiencies of scale , the semiconductor industry often uses wafers with standardized dimensions , or common wafer specifications silicon wafers are typically about 0.2–0.75 & nbsp ; mm thick , and can be polished to great flatness for making integrated circuits or textured for making solar cells the electrical characteristics of the silicon are controlled by adding material like phosphorus or boron to the silicon before it is melted during growth , the walls of the crucible dissolve into the melt and czochralski silicon therefore contains oxygen at a typical concentration of 10 & nbsp ; cm these have the effect of trapping unwanted transition metal impurities in a process known as gettering , improving the purity of surrounding silicon additionally , oxygen impurities can improve the mechanical strength of silicon wafers by immobilising any dislocations which may be introduced during device processing this results in the formation of an electrically active boron–oxygen complex that detracts from cell performance
