the å in scandinavian alphabets represents two sounds , one short and one long historically , the å derives from the old norse long vowel ( spelled with the letter á ) , but over time , it developed to an sound in most scandinavian language varieties ( in swedish and norwegian , it has eventually reached the pronunciation in old swedish the use of the ligature æ and of ø ( originally also a variant of the ligature œ ) that represented the sounds and respectively were gradually replaced by new letters most people felt no need for the new letter , although the letter group aa had already been pronounced like å for centuries in denmark and norway aa was usually treated as a single letter , spoken like the present å when spelling out names or words in some place names , the old aa spelling dominates , more often in denmark than in norway ( where it has been abolished in official use since 1917 ) å as a word means '' small river '' in danish , swedish , and norwegian and can be found in place names in family names , the bearer of the name uses aa or å according to their choice , but since family names are inherited they are resistant to change and the traditional aa style is often kept however , given names - which are less commonly inherited - have largely changed to the use of the å this is also true for the alternative spelling '' aa '' in danish the correct sorting of aa depends on pronunciation - if the sound is pronounced as one sound it is sorted as å regardless of the sound is ' a ' or ' å ' ; thus , for example , the german city aachen is listed under å , as well as the danish city aabenraa this is to a large extent due to the fact that prior to the creation of idna system around 2005 , internet domains containing scandinavian letters were not recognized by the dns system , and anyway do not feature on keyboards adapted for other languages even so , representing the å as just an a is particularly common in sweden , as compared to norway and denmark , because the spelling aa has no traditional use there image : pois pakkoruotsi.svg thumb the fact that å is a common letter in swedish while having no native use in finnish has led to it being used as a concise symbol for the swedish language in finland , as in this campaign to rid finnish schools of mandatory swedish å was introduced to some eastern local variants of walloon at the beginning of the 16th century and initially noted the same sound as in danish the use of a single å letter to cover such pronunciations has been embraced by the new pan-walloon orthography , with one orthography for words regardless of the local phonetic variations the walloon use of å became the most popular use outside a scandinavian language , even being used in the international phonetic alphabet drafted by otto jespersen the istro-romanian alphabet is based on the standard romanian alphabet with three additional letters used to mark sounds specific only to this language : å , ľ and ń
