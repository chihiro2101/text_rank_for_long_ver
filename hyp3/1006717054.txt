just before debord 's death , he filmed ( although did not release ) a documentary , son art et son temps ( his art and his times ) , an autobiography of sorts that focused primarily on social issues in paris in the 1990s due to his involvement with the radical situationist international ( si ) , as well as his sadness at 'the society as a spectacle ' being considered a cliché in later life , many think that debord felt hopeless about the very society he was trying to shed light on among the many commentaries on debord 's demise , one scholar noted : '' guy debord did not kill himself the ministry declared that '' he has been one of the most important contemporary thinkers , with a capital place in history of ideas from the second half of the twentieth century he continues to be a canonical and controversial figure particularly among european scholars of radical politics and modern art guy debord 's best known works are his theoretical books , the society of the spectacle and comments on the society of the spectacle the society of the spectacle was written in an '' interesting prose '' , unlike most writings in that time or of that nature debord postulated that alienation had gained a new relevance through the invasive forces of the 'spectacle ' – '' a social relation between people that is mediated by images '' consisting of mass media , advertising , and popular culture semiotics was also a major influence , particularly the work of his contemporary , roland barthes , who was the first to envisage bourgeois society as a spectacle , and to study in detail the political function of fashion within that spectacle central to this school of thought was the claim that alienation is more than an emotive description or an aspect of individual psychology : rather , it is a consequence of the mercantile form of social organization that has reached its climax in capitalism , as theorized by herbert marcuse of the frankfurt school the situationist international ( si ) , a political/artistic movement organized by debord and his colleagues and represented by a journal of the same name , attempted to create a series of strategies for engaging in class struggle by reclaiming individual autonomy from the spectacle as founder of the si , it has been suggested that debord felt driven to generalize and define the values , ideas , and characteristics of the entire group , which may have contributed to his hand-picking and expulsion of members '' often , it is suggested that debord was opposed to the creation of art , however , debord writes in the situationist international magazine ( '' contre le cinema '' ) that he believes that '' ordinary '' ( quotidian ) people should make '' everyday '' ( quotidian ) art ; art and creation should liberate from the spectacle , from capitalism , and from the banality of everyday life in contemporary society this integration of debord 's world with mass media culture became a running motif climaxing with '' the society of the spectacle '' debord wrote the book the society of the spectacle before writing the movie it worked as a final statement where debord recounted his works and a cultural documentary of '' his time '' guy debord , son art , son temps ( guy debord – his art and his time ) 1994 ( a '' sabotage television film '' by guy debord and brigitte cornand , canal plus ) complete cinematic works ( ak press , 2003 , translated and edited by ken knabb ) includes the scripts for all six of debord 's films , along with related documents and extensive annotations '' the beautiful language of my century '' : reinventing the language of contestation in postwar france , 1945–1968 , tom mcdonough , mit press 2007 , situationist international online letters 1957–1994 the marxist critique of religion in the films of guy debord guy debord 's howls for sade libcom.org/library : guy debord archive a brief biography and several texts , including society of the spectacle '' comments on the society of the spectacle '' ( 1988 ) guy debord and the situationists audio recordings and films by guy debord at ubu.web michael löwy on guy debord , in radical philosophy the strange life of guy debord ( french ) films / writings and literature on guy debord '' on guy debord ’ s films '' guy debord and the aesthetics of cine-sabotage constructing situations : guy debord 's detournement of fiction wall street vs the indigenous peoples movement—on guy debord 's work and the ngo-isation of indigenous peoples movements class wargames presents guy debord 's the game of war quote : '' anyone who has skimmed guy debord 's wikipedia page or watched the american music awards could condemn our culture as a masquerade , a spectacle of virtuality
