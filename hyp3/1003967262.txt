784 by his own admission , he was not interested in social psychology when he arrived at iowa , and did not take a single course in social psychology during his entire time there ; instead , he was interested in lewin 's earlier work on tension systems , but lewin 's focus had shifted to social psychology by the time festinger arrived at iowa 237 however , festinger continued to pursue his original interests , studying level of aspiration , festinger , 1942 working on statistics , festinger , 1943a festinger , 1943b developing a quantitative model of decision making , carlsmith & festinger , 1943 and even publishing a laboratory study on rats festinger , 1943c explaining his lack of interest in social psychology at the time , festinger stated , '' the looser methodology of the social psychology studies , and the vagueness of relation of the data to lewinian concepts and theories , all seemed unappealing to me in my youthful penchant for rigor it was at mit that festinger , in his own words , '' became , by fiat , a social psychologist , and immersed myself in the field with all its difficulties , vaguenesses , and challenges 237 it was also at mit that festinger began his foray into social communication and pressures in groups that marked a turning point in his own research 237–238 indeed , stanley schachter , festinger 's student and research assistant at the time , states , '' i was lucky enough to work with festinger at this time , and i think of it as one of the high points of my scientific life although the proximity effect ( or propinquity ) was an important direct finding from the study , festinger and his collaborators also noticed correlations between the degree of friendship within a group of residents and the similarity of opinions within the group , zukier , 1989 , p xiii thus raising unexpected questions regarding communication within social groups and the development of group standards of attitudes and behaviors festinger , schachter , & back , 1950 indeed , festinger 's seminal 1950 paper on informal social communication as a function of pressures toward attitude uniformity within a group cites findings from this seemingly unrelated housing satisfaction study multiple times during this time , festinger published his highly influential paper on social comparison theory , extending his prior theory regarding the evaluation of attitudes in social groups to the evaluation of abilities in social groups festinger , 1954 following this , in 1957 , festinger published his theory of cognitive dissonance , arguably his most famous and influential contribution to the field of social psychology festinger , 1957 some also view this as an extension of festinger 's prior work on group pressures toward resolving discrepancies in attitudes and abilities within social groups to how the individual resolves discrepancies at the cognitive level 104 festinger also received considerable recognition during this time for his work , both from within the field , being awarded the distinguished scientific contribution award by the american psychological association in 1959 , american , 1959 and outside of the field , being named as one of america 's ten most promising scientists by fortune magazine shortly after publishing social comparison theory 103 despite such recognition , festinger left the field of social psychology in 1964 , attributing his decision to '' a conviction that had been growing in me at the time that i , personally , was in a rut and needed an injection of intellectual stimulation from new sources to continue to be productive festinger , 1983 although seemingly the product of a disillusioned , wholesale abandonment of the field of psychology , festinger considered this research as a return to the fundamental concerns of psychology he described the goal of his new research interests as “ seeing what can be inferred from different vantage points , from different data realms , about the nature , the characteristics , of this species we call human , ” festinger , 1980 , p they also found that functional distance predicted social ties as well in his 1950 paper , festinger postulated that one of the major pressures to communicate arises from uniformity within a group , which in turn arises from two sources : social reality and group locomotion festinger , 1950 festinger argued that people depend on social reality to determine the subjective validity of their attitudes and opinions , and that they look to their reference group to establish social reality ; an opinion or attitude is therefore valid to the extent that it is similar to that of the reference group festinger labeled communications arising from such pressures toward uniformity as '' instrumental communication '' in that the communication is not an end in itself but a means to reduce discrepancies between the communicator and others in the group festinger 's influential social comparison theory ( 1954 ) can be viewed as an extension of his prior theory related to the reliance on social reality for evaluating attitudes and opinions to the realm of abilities thus festinger suggested that the '' social influence processes and some kinds of competitive behavior are both manifestations of the same socio-psychological process.namely , the drive for self evaluation and the necessity for such evaluation being based on comparison with other persons 4 festinger also later described the increased conviction and proselytizing by cult members after disconfirmation as a specific instantiation of cognitive dissonance ( i.e , increased proselytizing reduced dissonance by producing the knowledge that others also accepted their beliefs ) and its application to understanding complex , mass phenomena festinger 's seminal 1957 work integrated existing research literature on influence and social communication under his theory of cognitive dissonance 3 dissonance reduction can be achieved by changing cognition by changing actions , festinger , 1957 , p social comparison theory and cognitive dissonance have been described by other psychologists as '' the two most fruitful theories in social psychology 215 cognitive dissonance has been variously described as '' social psychology 's most notable achievement , '' zukier , 1989 , p xxi '' the most important development in social psychology to date , '' as cited in aronson , 1991 , p 214 and a theory without which '' social psychology would not be what it is today 661 cognitive dissonance spawned decades of related research , from studies focused on further theoretical refinement and development greenwald & ronis , 1978 to domains as varied as decision making , the socialization of children , and color preference 11 in addition , festinger is credited with the ascendancy of laboratory experimentation in social psychology as one who '' converted the experiment into a powerful scientific instrument with a central role in the search for knowledge xiv an obituary published by the american psychologist stated that it was '' doubtful that experimental psychology would exist at all '' without festinger warning against the dangers of such demands when theoretical concepts are not yet fully developed , festinger stated , '' research can increasingly address itself to minor unclarities in prior research rather than to larger issues ; people can lose sight of the basic problems because the field becomes defined by the ongoing research 170 also , while festinger is praised for his theoretical rigor and experimental approach to social psychology , he is regarded as having contributed to '' the estrangement between basic and applied social psychology in the united states 11 he '' became a symbol of the tough-minded , theory-oriented , pure experimental scientist , '' while ron lippitt , a fellow faculty member at lewin 's research center for group dynamics with whom festinger often clashed , '' became a symbol of the fuzzy-minded , do-gooder , practitioner of applied social psychology xiv–xv theories like cognitive dissonance could not be explained in behaviorist terms festinger & carlsmith , 1959 with festinger 's theories and the research that they generated , '' the monolithic grip that reinforcement theory had held on social psychology was effectively and permanently broken journal of abnormal and social psychology , 62 ( 1 ) , 35–40 psychological review , 50 , 595–621 psychological review , 49 , 235–250 journal of abnormal and social psychology , 37 , 184–200 psychological review , 57 ( 5 ) , 271–282 journal of social issues , 7 ( 1–2 ) , 152–163 journal of abnormal and social psychology , 47 ( 2 ) , 382–389 a theory of social comparison processes handbook of social psychology , vol 1 , theory and method , vol 2 , special fields and applications journal of applied psychology , 39 ( 5 ) , 384–385 social psychology and group processes american journal of mental deficiency , 64 ( 2 ) , 358–369 behavioral support for opinion change social research , 48 ( 2 ) , 306–321 psychological review , 72 ( 5 ) , 373–384 the journal of abnormal and social psychology , 58 ( 2 ) , 203–210 journal of experimental psychology-human perception and performance , 4 ( 4 ) , 573–585 journal of abnormal and social psychology , 49 ( 4 ) , 513–522 journal of abnormal and social psychology , 68 ( 4 ) , 359–366 vision research , 16 ( 12 ) , 1377–1386 journal of abnormal and social psychology , 46 ( 1 ) , 92–99 vision research , 18 ( 11 ) , 1545–1555 vision research , 17 ( 10 ) , 1231–1232 journal of experimental psychology-human perception and performance , 3 ( 2 ) , 187–200 journal of applied psychology , 45 ( 4 ) , 201–213 psychological science , 2 ( 4 ) , 213–217 psychological review , 50 , 595–621 ) , reflections on 100 years of experimental social psychology ( pp twenty years of cognitive dissonance : case study of the evolution of a theory psychological review , 85 ( 1 ) , 53–57 psychological review , 49 , 235–250 psychological review , 57 ( 5 ) , 271–282 a theory of social comparison processes the journal of abnormal and social psychology , 58 ( 2 ) , 203–210 perspectives on psychological science , 1 ( 1 ) , 88–94
