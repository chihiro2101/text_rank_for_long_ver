manufacturers may designate station wagons across various model lines with a proprietary nameplate station wagons and hatchbacks have in common a two-box design configuration , a shared interior volume for passengers and cargo and a rear door ( often called a tailgate in the case of a wagon ) that is hinged at roof level '' it has become common for station wagons to use a platform shared with other body styles , resulting in many shared components ( such as chassis , engine , transmission , bodywork forward of the a-pillar , interior features , and optional features ) being used for the wagon , sedan and hatchback variants of the car model by the early 1960s , this arrangement was common on both full-size and compact wagons similar configurations became the standard on full-size and intermediate station wagons from gm , ford , chrysler , and amc full-size general motors 1971–1976 wagons — the chevrolet kingswood estate ; pontiac grand safari ; oldsmobile custom cruiser , and the buick estate models — featured a 'clam shell ' design marketed as the glide-away tailgate , also called a '' disappearing '' tailgate because when open , the tailgate was completely out of view the subsequent generation of gm 's full-size station wagons returned to the upward-lifting rear window as had been used in the 1940s the first station wagons were built in around 1910 , by independent manufacturers producing wooden custom bodies for the ford model t chassis eventually , car manufacturers began producing their own station wagon designs in 1923 star ( a division of durant motors ) became the first car company to offer a station wagon assembled on its production line ( using a wooden wagon body shipped in from an outside supplier ) in 1922 , the essex ( automobile ) became the first mass-produced car to use a steel body ( in this case , a fully enclosed sedan body style ) station wagons were initially considered commercial vehicles ( rather than consumer automobiles ) and the framing of the early station wagons was left unsheathed , due to the commercial nature of the vehicles the commercial vehicle status was also reflected on those vehicles ' registrations for example , there were special '' suburban '' license plates in pennsylvania used well into the 1960s , long after station wagons became car-based one of the first builders of wagon bodies was the stoughton wagon company from wisconsin , who begun putting custom wagon bodies on the ford model t chassis in 1919 and by 1929 the ford motor company was the biggest producer of chassis ' for station wagons when it was introduced in 1941 the chrysler town & country was the most expensive car in the company 's model range the first postwar station wagon to be based on a passenger car chassis was the 1949 plymouth suburban , which used a two-door body style for example , plymouth continued production of wooden bodied station wagons until 1950 gm eliminated the pillarless wagon from its lineup in 1959 , while amc and ford exited the field beginning with their 1960 and 1961 vehicles , leaving chrysler and dodge with the body style through the 1964 model year while the k platform was also used for station wagon models ( such as the plymouth reliant and dodge aries ) , the minivan would soon eclipse them in popularity domestic wagons also remained in the ford , mercury , and saturn lines with other brands , the niche previously occupied by station wagons is now primarily filled with a similar style of crossover suv , which generally has a car underpinning and a wagon body european luxury car manufacturers such as audi , volvo , bmw , and mercedes-benz continued to offer station wagons in their north american product ranges ( marketed using the labels '' avant '' , '' touring '' , and '' estate '' respectively ) the station wagon variants of the smaller mercedes-benz c-class line-up were dropped in 2007 and the bmw 5 series touring models were discontinued in 2010 , due to slow sales in the united states with only 400 wagons sold in 2009 chrysler 's 1957 models had a roof too low to permit a forward-facing seat in the cargo area , so a rear-facing seat was used for the third row however , the 1964–1972 oldsmobile vista cruiser and 1964–1969 buick sport wagon featured raised roof-lines beginning above the second-row seat and continuing all the way to the rear tailgate , resulting in the third row of seats being forward-facing the majority of these models were two-door wagons and several models were built on the chassis of relatively small cars some station wagons were closely derived from existing commercial van models , such as the austin a35 and the hillman husky rover and austin produced 4×4 canvas-topped utility vehicles in the 1950s that were available in station wagon body styles that were sold as '' station wagons '' early advertising for the land rover version took the name literally , showing the vehicle collecting people and goods from a railway station ford and vauxhall produced factory-built station wagon variants of all three of their respective core models ( small- , mid- and large-size cars ) by the 1970s the fd- and fe-series vauxhall victors , built between 1966 and 1978 , were very large cars by british standards and featured station wagon models in the style of an american station wagon with front and rear bench seats and large-capacity petrol engines some larger station wagon models are available with a third row of seats , such as the rear-facing jump seat for two passengers in the cargo area of the mercedes-benz e-class wagon the type 3 's rear-engine layout was retained for the station wagon models , but the engine profile was flattened , resulting in a small car offering interior room , as well as trunk space in the front in france , almost all station wagon models are called a '' break '' , although the spelling is different from the english shooting brake in 1958 , the citroën id break ( known as the safari in english-speaking countries ) was introduced , being larger than other french station wagon models and of similar size to the contemporary full-size station wagons from the united states as with the citroëns , changing demands in the french car market led to the end of the large peugeot station wagon models in the mid-1990s , with the smaller peugeot 406 becoming the largest station wagon model in the range from 1995 in many markets , the station wagon models of the 700 series significantly outsold the sedan models in 1990 , the 700 series was replaced by the volvo 900 series , which was sold alongside the smaller volvo 850 wagon that was introduced one year later however , japanese manufacturers did not build station wagons in large volume until recently models marketed as passenger station wagons in export markets were often sold as utilitarian '' van '' models in the home market for example , a sedan might have a model life of four years , but the wagon was not updated for up to eight years ( such as the toyota corolla wagon built from 1979 to 1987 ) and the 1987-1996 mazda capella wagon ) station wagons remain popular in japan , although they are in slow decline as the suvs and minivans have taken over a large portion of this market the first australian-designed car was built in 1948 but locally designed station wagons did not appear until nine years later when the 1957 holden fe was introduced ford and holden produced wagon models based on each generation of their large sedan platforms until 2010 ford ceased production of wagons in australia when the ford falcon ( bf ) ended production in 2010 , largely due to the declining station wagon and large car market , but also following the 2004 introduction and sales success of the ford territory suv
