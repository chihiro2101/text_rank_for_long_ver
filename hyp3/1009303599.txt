bell identified three problem areas : radiated signals , signals conducted on wires extending from the facility , and magnetic fields filters for signal and power lines were developed , and the recommended control-perimeter radius was extended to 200 feet , based more on what commanders could be expected to accomplish than any technical criteria however , many users needed the higher signal levels to drive teleprinters at greater distances or where multiple teleprinters were connected , so the newer encryption devices included the option to switch the signal back up to the higher strength nsa began developing techniques and specifications for isolating sensitive-communications pathways through filtering , shielding , grounding , and physical separation : of those lines that carried sensitive plain text – from those intended to carry only non-sensitive data , the latter often extending outside of the secure environment a 1958 joint policy called nag-1 set radiation standards for equipment and installations based on a limit of control communications security board ( uscsb ) produced a flexowriter policy that banned its use overseas for classified information and limited its use within the u.s later , the nsa found similar problems with the introduction of cathode-ray-tube displays ( crts ) , which were also powerful radiators meanwhile , the problem of acoustic emanations became more critical with the discovery of some 900 microphones in u.s tempest standards continued to evolve in the 1970s and later , with newer testing methods and more-nuanced guidelines that took account of the risks in specific locations and situations current united states and nato tempest standards define three levels of protection requirements : nato sdip-27 level a ( formerly amsg 720b ) and usa nstissam level i : '' compromising emanations laboratory test standard '' : this is the strictest standard for devices that will be operated in nato zone 0 environments , where it is assumed that an attacker has almost immediate access ( e.g nato sdip-27 level b ( formerly amsg 788a ) and usa nstissam level ii : '' laboratory test standard for protected facility equipment '' : this is a slightly relaxed standard for devices that are operated in nato zone 1 environments , where it is assumed that an attacker can not get closer than about 20 metres ( 65 ' ) ( or where building materials ensure an attenuation equivalent to the free-space attenuation of this distance ) nato sdip-27 level c ( formerly amsg 784 ) and usa nstissam level iii : '' laboratory test standard for tactical mobile equipment/systems '' : an even more relaxed standard for devices operated in nato zone 2 environments , where attackers have to deal with the equivalent of 100 metres ( 300 ' ) of free-space attenuation ( or equivalent attenuation through building materials ) additional standards include : nato sdip-29 ( formerly amsg 719g ) : '' installation of electrical equipment for the processing of classified information '' : this standard defines installation requirements , for example in respect to grounding and cable distances additionally , the current nato standard sdip-27 ( before 2006 known as amsg 720b , amsg 788a , and amsg 784 ) is still classified for example , military handbook 1195 includes the chart at the right , showing electromagnetic shielding requirements at different frequencies in addition , many separation distance requirements and other elements are provided by the declassified nsa red-black installation guidance , nstissam tempest/2-95 tempest certification must apply to entire systems , not just to individual components , since connecting a single unshielded component ( such as a cable or device ) to an otherwise secure system could dramatically alter the system rf characteristics , maintaining distance or installing shielding between circuits and equipment used to handle plaintext classified or sensitive information that is not encrypted ( red ) and secured circuits and equipment ( black ) , the latter including those carrying encrypted signals manufacture of tempest-approved equipment must be done under careful quality control to ensure that additional units are built exactly the same as the units that were tested this paper caused some consternation in the security community , which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments ; van eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system , at a range of hundreds of metres , using just 15 worth of equipment plus a television set as a consequence of this research , such emanations are sometimes called '' van eck radiation '' , and the eavesdropping technique van eck phreaking , although government researchers were already aware of the danger , as bell labs noted this vulnerability to secure teleprinter communications during world war ii and was able to produce 75 % of the plaintext being processed in a secure facility from a distance of 80 feet almost all modems flash an led to show activity , and it is common for the flashes to be directly taken from the data line in 2014 , researchers introduced '' airhopper '' , a bifurcated attack pattern showing the feasibility of data exfiltration from an isolated computer to a nearby mobile phone , using fm frequency signals in february 2018 , research was published describing how low frequency magnetic fields can be used to escape sensitive data from faraday-caged , air-gapped computers with malware code-named ’ odini ’ that can control the low frequency magnetic fields emitted from infected computers by regulating the load of cpu cores he designed a signal disrupter initially to ensure that hidden microphones in sensitive meetings would not transmit , and adapted them for combat , capable of disrupting remotely activated devices like breaching charges bitwhisper : the heat is on the air-gap how to leak sensitive data from an isolated computer ( air-gap ) to a near by mobile phone - airhopper nsa tempest endorsement program the complete , unofficial tempest information page ( original defunct
