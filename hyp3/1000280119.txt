the first known idea for a guided surface-to-air missile was in 1925 , when a beam riding system was proposed whereby a rocket would follow a searchlight beam onto a target during world war ii , efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance in order to attack a target , guns fire continually while the aircraft are in range in order to launch as many shells as possible , increasing the chance that one of these will end up within the lethal range this was seen generally ; in november 1943 the director of gunnery division of the royal navy concluded that guns would be useless against jets , stating '' no projectile of which control is lost when it leaves the ship can be of any use to us in this matter as the urgency of the problem grew , new designs were added , including enzian and rheintochter , as well as the unguided taifun which was designed to be launched in waves both types used radio control for guidance , either by eye , or by comparing the returns of the missile and target on a single radar screen development of all these systems was carried out at the same time , and the war ended before any of them was ready for combat use in his opinion , had they been consistently developed from the start , the large scale bomber raids of 1944 would have been impossible the british developed unguided antiaircraft rockets ( operated under the name z battery ) close to the start of world war ii , but the air superiority usually held by the allies meant that the demand for similar weapons was not as acute '' nike zeus '' , flight international , 2 august 1962 concerns about ajax 's ability to deal with formations of aircraft led to greatly updated version of the same basic design entering service in 1958 as the nike hercules , the first nuclear-armed sam army air forces had also considered collision-course weapons ( like the german radio-controlled concepts ) and launched project thumper in 1946 the rsd 58 used beam riding guidance , which has limited performance against high-speed aircraft , as the missile is unable to '' lead '' the target to a collision point this led to the s-25 berkut system ( sa-1 in nato terminology ) , which was designed , developed and deployed in a rush program the s-25 was a static system , but efforts were also put into a smaller design that would be much more mobile these efforts picked up again with the opening of the cold war , following the '' stage plan '' of improving uk air defences with new radars , fighters and missiles two competing designs were proposed for '' stage 1 '' , based on common radar and control units , and these emerged as the raf 's bristol bloodhound in 1958 , '' bloodhound : the sagw system of the royal air force it would also be the first and only time that the latest and most modern air defense technologies of the soviet union and the most modern jet fighter planes and bombers of the united states confronted each other in combat early efforts to directly attack the missiles sites as part of operation spring high and operation iron hand were generally unsuccessful , but the introduction of wild weasel aircraft carrying agm-45 shrikes and the standard arm missile changed the situation dramatically by the time of operation linebacker ii in 1972 , the americans had gained critical information about the performance and operations of the s-75 ( by arab 's s-75 systems were captured by israel ) , and used these missions as a way to demonstrate the capability of strategic bombers to operate in a sam saturated environment the way to avoid this was to fly lower , below the line-of-sight of missile 's radar systems the introduction of sea-skimming missiles in the late 1960s and 1970s led to additional mid- and short-range designs for defence against these targets the uk 's sea cat was an early example that was designed specifically to replace the bofors 40 mm gun on its mount , and became the first operational point-defense sam many of these are adapted from earlier mobile designs , but the special needs of the naval role has resulted in the continued existence of many custom missiles as aircraft moved ever lower , and missile performance continued to improve , eventually it became possible to build an effective man-portable anti-aircraft missile the germans also produced a similar short-range weapon known as fliegerfaust , but it entered operation only on a very limited scale the performance gap between this weapon and jet fighters of the post-war era was so great that such designs would not be effective through the evolution of sams , improvements were also being made to anti-aircraft artillery , but the missiles pushed them into ever shorter-range roles modern long-range weapons include the patriot and s-300 ( missile ) systems , which have effective ranges on the order of 150 & nbsp ; km , and offer relatively good mobility and short unlimbering times '' s-400 missile defense systems to start defending moscow july 1 '' , ria novosti , 21 may 2007 medium-range designs , like the rapier and 2k12 kub , are specifically designed to be highly mobile with very fast , or zero , setup times once a major group onto itself , medium-range designs have seen less development since the 1990s , as the focus has changed to unconventional warfare ship-based anti-aircraft missiles are also considered to be sams , although in practice it is expected that they would be more widely used against sea skimming missiles rather than aircraft modern warships may carry all three types ( from long-range to short-range ) of sams as a part of their multi-layered air defence sam systems generally fall into two broad groups based on their guidance systems , those using radar and those using some other means early sam systems generally used tracking radars and fed guidance information to the missile using radio control concepts , referred to in the field as command guidance sarh has the advantage of leaving most of the equipment on the ground , while also eliminating the need for the ground station to communicate with the missile after launch a few older designs use purely optical tracking and command guidance , perhaps the best known example of this is the british rapier system , which was initially an all-optical system with high accuracy long-range systems generally use radar systems for target detection , and depending on the generation of system , may '' hand off '' to a separate tracking radar for attack
