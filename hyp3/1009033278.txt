however , a federation is more than a mere loose alliance of independent states the component states of a federation usually possess no powers in relation to foreign policy and so enjoy no independent status under international law a federation often emerges from an initial agreement between several separate states some present-day states of the brazilian federation retain borders set during the portuguese colonization ( before the very existence of the brazilian state ) , whereas the latest state , tocantins , was created by the 1988 constitution for chiefly administrative reasons while it is common for a federation to be brought into being by agreement between a number of formally independent states , in a unitary state self-governing regions are often created through a process of devolution , where a formerly centralized state agrees to grant autonomy to a region that was previously entirely subordinate it is often part of the philosophy of a unitary state that , regardless of the actual status of any of its parts , its entire territory constitutes a single sovereign entity or nation state , and that by virtue of this the central government exercises sovereignty over the whole territory as of right in a federation , on the other hand , sovereignty is often regarded as residing notionally in the component states , or as being shared between these states and the central government a confederation , in modern political terms , is usually limited to a permanent union of sovereign states for common action in relation to other states while the word confederation was officially used when the canadian federal system was established in 1867 , the term refers only to the process and not the resulting state since canadian provinces are not sovereign and do not claim to be 603 belgium was founded as a centralized state , after the french model , but has gradually been reformed into a federal state by consecutive constitutional reforms since the 1970s moreover , although nominally called a federal state , the country 's structure already has a number of confederation belgium at present , there is a growing movement to transform the existing federal state into a looser confederation with two or three constitutive states and/or two special regions in the wake of the civil war of the latter , use the term '' confederation '' to refer to the formation or joining , not the structure , of canada an empire is a multi-ethnic state , multinational state , or a group of nations with a central government established usually through coercion ( on the model of the roman empire ) a unitary state may closely resemble a federation in structure and , while a central government may possess the theoretical right to revoke the autonomy of a self-governing region , it may be politically difficult for it to do so in practice the european union ( eu ) is a type of political union or confederation ( the assemblage of societies or an association of two or more states into one state ) the eu is therefore not a de jure federation , although some academic observers conclude that after 50 years of institutional evolution since the treaties of rome it is becoming one the european union possesses attributes of a federal state however , its central government is far weaker than that of most federations and the individual members are sovereign states under international law , so it is usually characterized as an unprecedented form of supra-national union nonetheless , eu member states retain the right to act independently in matters of foreign policy and defense , and also enjoy a near-monopoly over other major policy areas such as criminal justice and taxation since the treaty of lisbon , the member states ' right to leave the union is codified , and the union operates with more qualified majority voting ( rather than unanimity ) in many areas the original german uses the word staatenverbund , which they translate as '' association of sovereign states '' , rather than the word staatenbund ( confederation of states ) or bundesstaat ( federal state ) one issue is that the exact division of power and responsibility between federal and regional governments is often a source of controversy another common issue in federal systems is the conflict between regional and national interests , or between the interests and aspirations of different ethnic groups basically , a modern federal government , within the limits defined by its constitution , has the power to make laws for the whole country , unlike local governments as originally written , the united states constitution was created to limit the federal government from exerting power over the states by enumerating only specific powers
