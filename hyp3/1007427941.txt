he furthermore declared that any child from this union would be first in the line of succession after radama upon andrianampoinimerina 's death in 1810 , radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among ramavo 's relatives , an act that may have strained their relationship however , they hesitated to report the news of radama 's death for several days , fearing possible reprisals against them for having been involved in denouncing one of the king 's rivals , whose family had a stake in the succession after radama & nbsp ; 42–45 during this time , another courtier , a high-ranking military officer named andriamamba , discovered the truth and collaborated with other powerful officers – andriamihaja , rainijohary and ravalontsalama – to support ramavo 's claim to the throne ramavo took the throne name ranavalona ( '' folded '' , '' kept aside '' ) , then followed royal custom by systematically capturing and putting to death her political rivals , including rakotobe , his family , and other members of radama 's family , much as radama had done to the queen 's own family upon his succession to the throne although female rulers had once been common among the vazimba , described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of madagascar , this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of andriamanelo ( 1540–1575 ) , founder of the kingdom of imerina and successor to his vazimba mother , queen rafohy ( 1530–1540 ) early in her reign , the queen took incremental steps to distance madagascar from the purview of european powers , first putting an end to a friendship treaty with britain , then placing increasing restrictions on the activities of the missionaries of the london missionary society , who operated schools where basic education and trade skills were taught in addition to the christian religion due in large part to loss of life throughout the years of military campaigns , high death rates among fanompoana workers , and harsh traditions of justice under her rule , the population of madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839 , and the population of imerina from 750,000 to 130,000 between 1829 and 1842 & nbsp ; 45–47 in the early years of ranavalona 's reign , andriamihaja was the leader of her court 's progressive faction , who favored maintaining the relations with europe initiated under radama the conservative faction was led by the brothers rainimaharo and rainiharo , the latter being the official guardian of one of the most powerful royal sampy 14 following andriamihaja 's death , the influence of radama 's old guard of progressives was eclipsed by that of conservative advisers at court , who grew ever closer to the queen , eventually resulting in ranavalona 's marriage to sampy guardian and conservative figurehead field marshal rainiharo ( also called ravoninahitriniarivo ) of ilafy in 1833 upon rainiharo 's death , the queen wed another conservative , field marshal andrianisa ( also called rainijohary ) , who remained ranavalona 's husband until her death in 1861 fanompoana labor among the population of imerina could include conscription into the military , enabling the queen to raise a standing army that was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers deaths among the merina soldiers engaged in military actions were also high , estimated at about 160,000 for the period 1820–1853 one of the chief measures by which ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by ordeal of tangena following a visit by radama i to madagascar 's first formal school , established in toamasina in 1818 by members of the london missionary society ( lms ) , the king invited the first christian artisan missionaries to the capital city to share their knowledge near the end of radama 's reign , the king came to regard the few malagasy who had been converted as irreverent toward royal authority the freedom allowed to lms and malagasy christians to print religious materials and teach religion in the state schools during the first six years of ranavalona 's reign allowed the religion to become firmly established among a small but growing group of converts in and around the capital in october and november 1831 the queen enacted a ban on christian marriages , baptisms , and church services for soldiers and members of government studying in the missionary schools , ellis ( 1870 ) , p & nbsp ; 222–223 from 1832 to 1834 , baptisms and church services continued , increasingly in secret during this time , several christians each year were charged with witchcraft and exiled or made to undergo the tangena ordeal , ralibera and de taffin ( 1993 ) , p 223 and ranavalona requested the departure of three missionaries , retaining only those whose particular technical skills she viewed as valuable to the state & nbsp ; 184–186 in 1835 , the queen attempted to shut down the press without directly targeting the lms by banning malagasy personnel from working at the printing house she furthermore acknowledged the valuable intellectual and technological contributions that european missionaries had made to the advancement of her country , and invited them to continue working to that end on the condition that their proselytizing would cease : koschorko ( 2007 ) , p 199 james cameron and other key missionaries preferred to leave rather than remain on the island without authorization to proselytize ; most of the london missionary society missionaries , whose primary activity was teaching christian theology and literacy at their newly established schools using the bible as the principal malagasy-language text , departed the island the last two remaining missionaries chose to continue teaching practical skills in the hope that the restrictions might loosen , but one year later , after receiving indirect information that the government desired their departure , they closed the lms mission and left madagascar for instance , they reported the public execution of 15 christian leaders near the queen 's palace who were dangled on ropes 150 feet above a rock-filled ravine before the ropes were cut upon their refusal to renounce christianity 79 the precise number of malagasy citizens put to death for religious reasons during ranavalona 's reign is difficult to state with certainty far more were required to undergo the tangena ordeal , condemned to hard labor , or stripped of their land and property , and many of these died the french , who held several small islands off madagascar , were interested in gaining control over the main island but this move was opposed by the british who had an interest in maintaining a secure passage to india one consequence of the termination of the anglo-merina friendship treaty was an end to the delivery of modern weaponry , which rendered the queen vulnerable to designs against her from foreign powers and pockets of local resistance the french were eager to hasten radama ii 's succession in the interest of capitalizing on the lambert charter , an 1855 agreement between french representative joseph-françois lambert and radama that could only come into effect upon the prince 's succession according to a british account , lambert conspired with jean laborde and local leaders to persuade radama ii to sign a document written in french—a language in which the prince was not fluent—which lambert orally translated as containing only an account of the excessive pressures the queen 's policies were placing on her subjects he was not told the letter included a request for french military intervention that could have potentially brought madagascar under french rule france did not however intend to take such an action without the accord of britain , whose influence had been well-established on the island , and refused to intercede on behalf of the prince & nbsp ; 80–85 according to lambert , however , the prince had indeed been an enthusiastic partner in the bid to end ranavalona 's reign , and his own true feelings about the endeavor had been misrepresented by the british diplomats 225 having failed to gain the backing of a european state power to place radama on the throne and bring the treaty into effect , lambert decided to instigate a coup d'état independently & nbsp ; 225–277 according to a british account , however , radama himself was credited with warning the queen of the plot , in which his cooperation was merely a ploy to entrap the conspirators after the plot 's discovery , the europeans were largely confined to their houses on the palace grounds and prohibited from receiving visitors , until an order was issued to immediately and permanently quit the queen 's territory in late july while the queen had designated her son , radama ii , as her successor , rainimaharo and the conservative faction knew of his progressive leanings and tried instead to ensure the queen 's nephew , ramboasalama , would come to power and maintain loyalties to them and their political agenda 430 the progressive brothers rainivoninahitriniony and rainilaiarivony , who were the queen 's co-prime minister and head of the army respectively at the time of her death , supported the succession of radama and were able to exercise greater influence than ramboasalama , particularly in ensuring the support of the army for the prince 's claim to the throne as ranavalona lay on her death bed , radama took precautions to ensure his succession would be uncontested , surrounding his residence at the rova of antananarivo with several hundred soldiers and sending a member of ramboasalama 's family to bring him to the rova to swear a public oath of allegiance to the new king , to whom he submitted
