image : fastrak transponder.jpg right frame fastrak , an rfid tag used for electronic toll collection in california in 1945 , l√©on theremin invented a listening device for the soviet union which retransmitted incident radio waves with the added audio information even though this device was a covert listening device , rather than an identification tag , it is considered to be a predecessor of rfid because it was passive , being energized and activated by waves from an outside source the basic cardullo patent covers the use of rf , sound and light as transmission carriers a battery-assisted passive tag has a small battery on board and is activated when in the presence of an rfid reader a passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery ; instead , the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader however , to operate a passive tag , it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than an active tag for signal transmission tags may either be read-only , having a factory-assigned serial number that is used as a key into a database , or may be read/write , where object-specific data can be written into the tag by the system user field programmable tags may be write-once , read-multiple ; '' blank '' tags may be written with an electronic product code by the user since tags have individual serial numbers , the rfid system design can discriminate among several tags that might be within the range of the rfid reader and read them simultaneously a variation of this system could also use a battery-assisted passive ( bap ) tag which acts like a passive tag but has a small battery to power the tag 's return reporting signal as5678 balise bin bug chipless rfid internet of things mass surveillance microchip implant ( human ) near field communication ( nfc ) positiveid privacy by design proximity card resonant inductive coupling rfdump rfid in schools rfid journal rfid on metal rsa blocker tag smart label speedpass tectile tracking system
