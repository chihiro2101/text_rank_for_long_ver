. within months , gold was placed in charge of constructing new radar systems this led the three to all start questioning the big bang theory originally proposed by georges lemaître in 1931 and later advanced by george gamow , which suggested that the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today it can be just in a steady state with the expansion taking things apart as fast as new matter comes into being and condenses into new galaxies '' in their seminal paper , gold and bondi asserted that although the universe is expanding , it nevertheless does not change its look over time ; it has no beginning and no end . it was not until the 1960s that major problems with the steady-state theory began to emerge , when observations apparently supported the idea that the universe was in fact changing : quasars and radio galaxy were found only at large distances ( therefore existing only in the distant past ) , not in closer galaxies whereas the big bang theory predicted as much , steady state predicted that such objects would be found everywhere , including close to our own galaxy , since evolution would be more evenly distributed , not observed only at great distances gold even supported hoyle 's modified steady-state theory , however , by 1998 , he started to express some doubts about the theory , but maintained that despite its faults , the theory helped improve understanding regarding the origin of the universe gold suggested a '' garbage theory '' for the origin of life which was an accidental panspermia ; the theory says that life on earth might have spread from a pile of waste products accidentally dumped on earth long ago by extraterrestrials in 1951 , at a meeting of the royal astronomical society , gold proposed that the source of recent radio signals detected from space was outside the milky way galaxy , much to the derision of radio astronomer martin ryle and several mathematical cosmologists however , a year later , a distant source was identified and gold announced at an international astronomical union meeting in rome that his theory had been proven . the theory was widely disputed , until american scientists in 1957 discovered that gold 's theory held up to mathematical scrutiny by conducting a simulation using a shock tube gold 's conclusion was initially not well received by the scientific community ; in fact , he was refused permission to present his theory at the first international conference on pulsars at the time , scientists were engaged in a heated debate over the physical properties of the moon 's surface . gold initially suggested that astronauts would sink into the dust , but upon later analysis of impact craters and electrostatic fields , he determined that the astronauts ' boots would sink only three centimeters into the moon 's surface gold was ridiculed by fellow scientists , not only for his hypothesis , but for the approach he took in communicating nasa 's concerns to the american public ; in particular , some experts were infuriated with his usage of the term '' moon dust '' in reference to lunar regolith however , gold received little credit for his correct prediction , and was even criticized for his original prediction of a deep layer of lunar dust . in the late 1970s , just as the united states faced another major energy crisis , gold resurrected his work on petroleum the discovery of life in this adverse environment led gold to reconsider the established interpretation of petroleum formation . gold theorized that since petroleum and its component hydrocarbons were present across the entire universe , there was no reason to believe '' that on earth they must be biological in origin '' . gold proposed that fuels were trapped inside the core of the earth in randomized molecular form nearly 4.5 billion years ago as they move up toward the surface , the hydrocarbons fueled the development of large microbial colonies , which served as the basis for life on earth soon after gold started publishing his theories , researchers discovered a number of ecosystems functioning under '' conditions of heat and pressure once thought impossible to sustain life '' from this , gold proposed that the earth may possess a virtually endless supply – suggesting as much as '' at least 500 million years ' worth of gas '' – of fossil fuels gold began testing his theory in 1986 when , with the backing of a group of investors , vattenfall and the gas research institute , he commenced efforts to drill a deep borehole – named gravberg-1 – into the earth near lake siljan in search of abiogenic gas in the mantle he argued that '' it suggests there is an enormous sphere of life , of biology , at deeper levels in the ground than we have had any knowledge of previously '' and that this evidence would '' destroy the orthodox argument that since oil contains biological molecules , oil reserves must have derived from biological material '' the point is also that they will have to find commercially viable amounts , and it may be a long time before we know if they do in a 1992 paper , '' the deep , hot biosphere '' published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , gold first suggested that microbial life is widespread in the porosity of the crust of the earth , down to depths of several kilometers , where rising temperatures finally set a limit a 1993 article by journalist william broad , published in the new york times and titled '' strange new microbes hint at a vast subterranean world , '' carried gold 's thesis to public attention the article began , '' new forms of microbial life are being discovered in such abundance deep inside the earth that some scientists are beginning to suspect that the planet has a hidden biosphere extending miles down whose total mass may rival or exceed that of all surface life if a deep biosphere does exist , scientists say , its discovery will rewrite textbooks while shedding new light on the mystery of life 's origins he wrote in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences last year that the solar system might harbor at least 10 deep biospheres 'such life may be widely disseminated in the universe , ' he said , 'since planetary type bodies with similar subsurface conditions may be common as solitary objects in space , as well as in other solar-type systems ' '' gold also published a book of the same title , the deep hot biosphere , in 1999 , which expanded on the arguments in his 1992 paper and included speculations on the origin of life and on horizontal gene transfer freeman dyson wrote the foreword to gold 's 1999 book , where he concluded , '' gold 's theories are always original , always important , usually controversial — and usually right it is my belief , based on fifty years of observation of gold as a friend and colleague , that the deep hot biosphere is all of the above : original , important , controversial — and right ) following gold 's death , scientific discoveries amplified and also shifted understanding of the deep hot biosphere into what is now generally called deep biosphere '' gold wrote , '' in retrospect , it is not hard to understand why the scientific community has typically sought only surface life in the heavens gold won the john frederick lewis prize from the american philosophical society in 1972 for his paper '' the nature of the lunar surface : recent evidence '' . in his foreword to gold 's book the deep hot biosphere , theoretical physicist freeman dyson stated , '' gold 's theories are always original , always important , usually controversial – and usually right anthony tucker of the guardian said , '' throughout his life he would dive into new territory to open up problems unseen by others – in biophysics , astrophysics , space engineering , or geophysics
