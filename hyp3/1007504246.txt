from this position he played a key role in a number of battles , including one against syracuse , a city which he himself would later conquer instead , he took power for himself with the help of the army in 491 bc in 485 bc , the aristocracy of syracuse called the gamori , who had been forced out of the city by the common people , came to gelon seeking his aid seeing an opportunity for expansion , gelon used his now large military force to capture the city of syracuse with little or no resistance , reinstating the exiled gamori however , some were recruited from the greek mainland , men who had most likely fought with gelon at some point in the past , and their total number was said to be around 10,000 in fact , he went so far as to prepare gifts for xerxes in case the persian king won his war against the greek alliance the carthaginians were keen to increase their influence and territory in sicily and the opportunity came at a perfect time because of the coming persian invasion of greece the riches collected from the carthaginian camp , as well as the 2,000 talents of silver that resulted from the peace treaty with carthage , were dispersed by gelon among his troops and his allies , with a large amount designated for the construction of a new temple in syracuse according to herodotus , upon his return to his capital , gelon organized a meeting with the people of syracuse , and described to them his actions during the war with hamilcar , and the manner in which he dispersed the spoils the people of syracuse decided to keep gelon as their tyrant , and he continued his reign in peace for the next two years gelon 's first major contribution to greek , and more specifically sicilian , history was the foundation of syracuse as his capital , which he turned into â€œ the greatest greek city in the west also , by bringing in the wealthy citizens from conquered cities , a tactic never before used in sicily , he greatly increased the prosperity of the city there is little doubt that if hamilcar had managed to defeat the large sicilian force of gelon and theron , he could have conquered the entire island of sicily if he so wished the greek states on the mainland would have been unable to send troops due to their own war with the persians if , as many historians believe , the persian and carthaginian armies were in contact with each other , a defeat at himera for gelon could have led to a two pronged attack on the greek mainland by the persian and the carthaginians , and perhaps to the eventual demise of greek civilisation
