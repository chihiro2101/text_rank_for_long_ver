although aerial photography was first used extensively in the first world war , it was only in the second world war that specialized imagery intelligence operations were initiated this allowed reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures from very high altitudes without the camera parts freezing the systematic collection and interpretation of the huge amounts of aerial reconnaissance intelligence data soon became imperative together with other members of his reconnaissance squadron , he pioneered the technique of high-altitude , high-speed photography that was instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets immediately after world war ii , long range aerial reconnaissance was taken up by adapted jet bombers – such as the english electric canberra , and its american development , the martin b-57 – capable of flying higher or faster than the enemy early use of satellites low- and high-flying planes have been used all through the last century to gather intelligence about the enemy though the resolution of satellite photographs , which must be taken from distances of hundreds of kilometers , is usually poorer than photographs taken by air , satellites offer the possibility of coverage for much of the earth , including hostile territory , without exposing human pilots to the risk of being shot down the primary purpose of most spy satellites is to monitor visible ground activity some other uses of satellite imaging have been to produce detailed 3d maps for use in operations and missile guidance systems , and to monitor normally invisible information such as the growth levels of a country 's crops or the heat given off by certain facilities since 1985 , commercial vendors of satellite imagery have entered the market , beginning with the french spot satellites , which had resolutions between 5 and 20 metres recent high-resolution ( 4–0.5 metre ) private imaging satellites include terrasar-x , ikonos , orbview , quickbird and worldview-1 , allowing any country ( or any business for that matter ) to buy access to satellite images as such , the united states army field manual breaks imint analysis into three distinct phases , based upon the amount of time expended in exploiting any given image due to the need to produce near-real time intelligence assessments based upon collected imagery , first phase imagery analysis is rarely compared to collateral intelligence like first phase imagery analysis , second phase imagery analysis is generally catalyzed by a local commander 's priority intelligence requirements , at least in the context of a military operational setting third phase imagery analysis is generally conducted in order to satisfy strategic intelligence questions or to otherwise explore existing data in the search of '' discovery intelligence third phase imagery analysis incorporates supporting information and intelligence from other intelligence gathering disciplines and is , therefore , generally conducted in support of a multi-source intelligence team
