work in modernist and late modernity traditions , as well as artists who reject postmodernism for other reasons after the end of art : contemporary art and the pale of history arthur c danto some postmodern artists have made more distinctive breaks from the ideas of modern art and there is no consensus as to what is '' late-modern '' and what is '' post-modern wendy steiner , venus in exile :

modern art post-modernism : the new classicism in art and architecture charles jencks as well as describing certain tendencies of contemporary art , postmodern has also been used to denote a phase of modern art jean-françois lyotard , in fredric jameson 's analysis , does not hold there is a postmodern stage radically different from the period of high modernism ; instead , postmodern discontent with this or that high modernist style is part of the experimentation of high modernism , giving birth to new modernisms many critics hold postmodern art emerges from modern art the close of the period of postmodern art has been dated to the end of the 1980s , when the word postmodernism lost much of its critical resonance , and art practices began to address the impact of globalization and new media baudrillard himself , since 1984 , was fairly consistent in his view contemporary art , and postmodern art in particular , was inferior to the modernist art of the post world war ii period ,

avant-garde is controversial : many institutions argue being visionary , forward-looking , cutting-edge , and progressive are crucial to the mission of art in the present , and therefore postmodern art contradicts the value of '' art of our times '' rosalind krauss was one of the important enunciators of the view that avant-gardism was over , and the new artistic era is post-liberal and post-progress griselda pollock studied and confronted the avant-garde and modern art in a series of groundbreaking books , reviewing modern art at the same time as redefining postmodern art the use of low forms of art were a part of modernist experimentation as well , as documented in kirk varnedoe and adam gopnik 's 1990–91 show high and low : popular culture and modern art at new york 's museum

which it blurs the distinctions between what is perceived as fine or high art and what is generally seen as low or kitsch art while this concept of '' blurring '' or '' fusing '' high art with low art had been experimented during modernism , it only ever became fully endorsed after the advent of the postmodern era postmodernism introduced elements of commercialism , kitsch and a general camp aesthetic within its artistic context ; postmodernism takes styles from past periods , such as gothicism , the renaissance and the baroque , and mixes them so as to ignore their original use in their corresponding artistic movement against this definition , art and language 's charles harrison and paul wood maintained pastiche and discontinuity are endemic to modernist art , and are deployed effectively by modern artists such as manet and picasso krauss , for example , describes pablo picasso 's use of collage as an avant-garde practice anticipating postmodern art with its emphasis on language at the expense of autobiography another point of view is avant-garde and modernist artists used similar strategies and postmodernism repudiates both during the late 1940s and early 1950s , pollock 's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all contemporary art following him pollock realized the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself abstract expressionism expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities artists had available for the creation of new works of art in abstract art during the 1950s and 1960s several new directions like hard-edge painting and other forms of geometric abstraction like the work of frank stella popped up , as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism began to appear in artist studios and in radical avant-garde circles clement greenberg became the voice of post-painterly abstraction ; by curating an influential exhibition of new painting touring important art museums throughout the united states in 1964 also emerged as revolutionary concepts and movements encompassing painting and sculpture , via lyrical abstraction and the postminimalist movement , and in early conceptual art process art as inspired by pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style , content , material , placement , sense of time , and plastic and real space during the late 1950s and 1960s , artists with a wide range of interests began pushing the boundaries of contemporary art these performances were often designed to be the creation of a new art form , combining sculpture , dance , and music or sound , often with audience participation the work of robert rauschenberg , whose '' combines '' in the 1950s were forerunners of pop art and installation art , and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects , including stuffed animals , birds and commercial photography , exemplified this art trend lawrence alloway used the term '' pop art '' to describe paintings celebrating consumerism of the post world war ii era this movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior , in favor of art which depicted , and often celebrated , material consumer culture , advertising , and iconography of the mass production age thomas mcevilly , agreeing with dave hickey , says u.s postmodernism in the visual arts began with the first exhibitions of pop art in 1962 , '' though it took about twenty years before postmodernism became a dominant attitude in the visual arts

anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility , disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice associated with painters such as frank stella , minimalism in painting , as opposed to other areas , is a modernist movement and depending on the context can be construed as a precursor to the postmodern movement conceptual art is sometimes labelled as postmodern because it is expressly involved in deconstruction of what makes a work of art , '' art '' precursors to conceptual art include the work of duchamp , john cage 's 4 ' 33 '' , in which the music is said to be '' the sounds of the environment that the listeners ' hear while it is performed , '' and rauschenberg 's erased de kooning drawing many conceptual works take the position that art is created by the viewer viewing an object or act as art , not from the intrinsic qualities of the work itself an important series of movements in art which have consistently been described as postmodern involved installation art and creation of artifacts that are conceptual in nature the impact of digital technology has transformed activities such as painting , drawing , sculpture and music/sound art , while new forms , such as net art , digital installation art , and virtual reality , have become recognized artistic practices another trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together intermedia , a term coined by dick higgins and meant to convey new artforms along the lines of fluxus , concrete poetry , found objects , performance art , and computer art while the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old , and has been revived periodically , the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with performance art , where the dramatic subtext is removed , and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action ''
