standardbreds are so named because in the early years of the standardbred stud book , only horses who could trot or pace a mile in a standard time ( or whose progeny could do so ) of no more than 2 minutes , 30 seconds were admitted to the book pacing races constitute 80 % to 90 % of the harness races conducted in north america - while the clear majority of harness racing in australia and new zealand are also now for pacers , even though the sport is colloquially still known as 'the trots most harness races start from behind a motorized starting gate , also known as the mobile barrier another kind of start is a standing start , where there are tapes or imaginary lines across the track behind which the horses either stand stationary or trot in circles in pairs in a specific pattern to hit the starting line as a group many european – and some australian and new zealand – races use a standing start , although this increases the chance of a 'false start ' where one or a number of horses commence 'off-stride ' and gallop the horses are entered in the race based on life-time earnings , unless they have qualified by performing well in the preceding six qualifying races one of them ( jägersro ) is a combined thoroughbred and standardbred track , while another is only used once every year the latter race track also hosts the hugo åbergs memorial , which is an international race open for all horses one single '' row '' is very cheap to play , but people usually play large systems , picking the winner in one or two of the races and several horses in the other races the price for a system grows rapidly if many horses are picked in a race in such case the silver division horses must run 60 & nbsp ; m behind the less experienced class ii horses some races use the mobile starting gate as seen in the united states horses number 6 and 7 can both get a better speed at the starting line , and there are no horses in front of them a very good horse in a race with weak opponents but with a bad start number ( like 12 or higher ) may not become the prime favorite due to the bad starting position , especially at short distance how well this succeeds depends on the horse , the starting position and how the opponents drive their horses the '' running position fight '' during start and the beginning of the race usually ends in the first turn after the initial fight for good running position , the horses usually form two rows or tracks good running positions are the leading position of the inner track or the second ( or third ) place in the outer track this is explained with the fact that the outer track is close to 15 meter longer per lap , front running is always heavier compared with just follow behind ( just like in cycling ) and horses in the inner track may very well be trapped all the way to the finish , due to the horses and sulkies in the outer track on the other hand , if an opening in the outer track appears close to the finish line , such a horse have had '' an easy ride '' with much strength left to give the leading position of the outer track , also known as the position of '' death '' , is a very hard position to run and only very strong horses can win from this position if a horse completes the race from the '' death '' position , commentators often point that out when announcing the km pace of the horse on short distance ( 1640 meter ) , the horse that gets the leading position of the inner track has a very good chance to be the winner at longer races ( with rather even competitors ) running positions like second or third in the outer track have good chances , especially if the inner track horses get trapped behind a weakening front horse also , on the shorter tracks early speed is important , while the longer stretch run of a mile track favors horses with late speed for come-from-behind wins they then try to avoid getting '' boxed in '' as the horses form into two lines – one on the rail and the other outside – in the second quarter-mile they may decide to go to the front ; to race on the front on the outside ( '' first over '' , a difficult position ) ; or to race with '' cover '' on the outside as the race nears the three-quarter mile mark , the drivers implement their tactics for advancing their positions – going to the lead early ; circling the field ; moving up an open rail ; advancing behind a horse expected to tire and so on australian racing differs from north american racing in that metric distances are used , generally above the equivalent of one mile and horses are classed by how many wins they have another large difference is that in australian racing the leader does not have to hand up the lead to any horse that challenges , often leaving a horse parked outside the leader in the '' death seat '' or simply '' the death '' ( known as '' facing the breeze '' in new zealand ) , as this horse covers more ground than the leader this generally means that with the smaller tracks a '' three wide train '' starts as the field gets the bell at signal their final lap many horses are able to easily '' cross the tasman '' and compete as well on either side of the sea that separates australia and new zealand in australia and new zealand , harness racing is conducted both on smaller rural tracks and at major city venues , creating the opportunity for even the hobby-trainer to make it into the big-time if they have an exceptional horse betting revenues have come under pressure from both thoroughbred racing and from expanding opportunities in greyhound racing - however 'the trots ' still has a dedicated following and a rich history to enjoy
