during world war ii and the early years of the cold war , the venona project was a source of information on soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the western military powers to what extent the various individuals referred to in the messages were involved with soviet intelligence is a topic of historical dispute while a number of academics and historians assert that most of the individuals mentioned in the venona decrypts were most likely either clandestine assets and/or contacts of soviet intelligence agents , how venona was declassified , robert louis benson , symposium of cryptologic history ; october 27 , 2005 army 's signal intelligence service at arlington hall analyzed encrypted high-level soviet diplomatic intelligence messages intercepted in large volumes during and immediately after world war ii by american , british , and australian listening posts however , cryptanalysis by american code-breakers revealed that some of the one-time pad material had incorrectly been reused by the soviets ( specifically , entire pages , although not complete books ) , which allowed decryption ( sometimes only partial ) of a small part of the traffic it was arlington hall 's lieutenant richard hallock , working on soviet '' trade '' traffic ( so called because these messages dealt with soviet trade issues ) , who first discovered that the soviets were reusing pages a young meredith gardner then used this material to break into what turned out to be nkvd ( and later gru ) traffic by reconstructing the code used to convert text to numbers on 20 december 1946 , gardner made the first break into the code , revealing the existence of soviet espionage in the manhattan project venona messages also indicated that soviet spies worked in washington in the state department , treasury , office of strategic services , and even the white house one significant aid ( mentioned by the nsa ) in the early stages may have been work done in cooperation between the japanese and finland cryptanalysis organizations ; when the americans broke into japanese codes during world war ii , they gained access to this information the finnish radio intelligence sold much of its material concerning soviet codes to oss in 1944 during operation stella polaris , including the partially burned code book at least one soviet penetration agent , british secret intelligence service representative to the u.s the us army security agency , in the person of meredith knox gardner , a genius in his own right , had broken one of what it termed the venona messages—the transmissions that soviet agents in the united states sent to and received from moscow others worked in washington in the state department , the treasury , office of strategic services , '' kgb cables indicated that the office of strategic services ( oss ) in world war ii had been thoroughly infiltrated with soviet agents the identification of individuals mentioned in venona transcripts is sometimes problematic , since people with a '' covert relationship '' with soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms according to authors john earl haynes and harvey klehr , the venona transcripts identify approximately 349 americans who they claim had a covert relationship with soviet intelligence , though fewer than half of these have been matched to real-name identities however , not every agent may have been communicating directly with soviet intelligence the office of strategic services , the predecessor to the cia , housed at one time or another between fifteen and twenty soviet spies the war production board , the board of economic warfare , the office of the coordinator of inter-american affairs and the office of war information , included at least half a dozen soviet sources each among their employees moreover , they argue no evidence of hopkins as an agent has been found in other archives , and the partial message relating to '' 19 '' does not indicate if this source was a spy some of the earliest messages decrypted concerned information from a scientist at the manhattan project , who was referred to by the code names of charles and rest one such message from moscow to new york , dated april 10 , 1945 , called information provided by charles '' of great value '' in his 1998 book , united states senator daniel patrick moynihan expressed certainty about hiss 's identification by venona as a soviet spy , writing '' hiss was indeed a soviet agent and appears to have been regarded by moscow as its most important as it had been sent from new york and had its origins in the british embassy in washington , philby , who would not have known maclean 's cryptonym , deduced the sender 's identity but the presentation of venona material to chifley , revealing evidence of soviet agents operating in australia , brought this about senior army officers , in consultation with the fbi and cia , made the decision to restrict knowledge of venona within the government ( even the cia was not made an active partner until 1952 ) army chief of staff omar bradley , concerned about the white house 's history of leaking sensitive information , decided to deny president truman direct knowledge of the project some of the earliest detailed public knowledge that soviet code messages from world war ii had been broken came with the release of chapman pincher 's book , too secret too long , in 1984 however , the first detailed account of the venona project , identifying it by name and making clear its long-term implications in post-war espionage , was contained in mi5 assistant director peter wright 's 1987 memoir , spycatcher many inside the nsa had argued internally that the time had come to publicly release the details of the venona project , but it was not until 1995 that the bipartisan commission on government secrecy , with senator moynihan as chairman , released venona project materials moynihan wrote : '' the secrecy system has systematically denied american historians access to the records of american history however , in at least one case , independent researchers identified one of the subjects whose name had been obscured by the nsa the dearth of reliable information available to the public—or even to the president and congress—may have helped to polarize debates of the 1950s over the extent and danger of soviet espionage in the united states as the moynihan commission wrote in its final report : '' a balanced history of this period is now beginning to appear ; the venona messages will surely supply a great cache of facts to bring the matter to some closure the memo is now available on line at in the memo , belmont discusses the possibility of using the venona translations in court to prosecute soviet agents , and comes out strongly opposed to their use '' he also notes the complexities of identifying people with covernames , describing how the personal details mentioned for covername '' antenna '' fit more than one person , and the investigative process required to finally connect '' antenna '' to julius rosenberg for a summary of a draft response from lowenthal ( he died in 2003 ) see another response following this was this gave rise to a conference paper : ( archived version ) and finally a response from mark again ( he died in 2009 ) : and even prompted the nsa to declassify the original russian text '' commenting on the list of 349 americans identified by venona , published in an appendix to venona : decoding soviet espionage in america , navasky wrote , '' the reader is left with the implication—unfair and unproven—that every name on the list was involved in espionage , and as a result , otherwise careful historians and mainstream journalists now routinely refer to venona as proof that many hundreds of americans were part of the red spy network '' navasky goes further in his defense of the listed people and has claimed a great deal of the so-called espionage that went on was nothing more than '' exchanges of information among people of good will '' and that '' most of these exchanges were innocent and were within the law '' according to historian ellen schrecker , '' because they offer insights into the world of the secret police on both sides of the iron curtain , it is tempting to treat the fbi and venona materials less critically than documents from more accessible sources elizabeth bentley history of soviet and russian espionage in the united states list of americans in the venona papers list of soviet agents in the united states
