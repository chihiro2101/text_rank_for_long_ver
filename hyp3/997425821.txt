although there are modchips that can be reprogrammed for different purposes , most modchips are designed to work within only one console system or even only one specific hardware version memory cards or cartridges that offer functions similar to modchips work on a completely different concept , namely by exploiting flaws in the system 's handling of media early in the transition from solid-state to optical media , cd-based console systems did not have regional market segmentation or copy protection measures due to the rarity and high cost of user-writable media at the time in addition to circumventing regional lockout and copy protection mechanisms , modern modchips may introduce more sophisticated modifications to the system , such as allowing the use of user-created software ( homebrew ) , expanding the hardware capabilities of its host system , or even installing an alternative operating system to completely re-purpose the host system ( e.g since modchips often hook into fundamental functions of the host system that can not be removed or adjusted , these measures may not completely prevent a modchip from functioning but only prompt an adjustment of its installation process or programming , e.g with the advent of online services to be used by video game consoles , some manufacturers have executed their possibilities within the service 's license agreement to ban consoles equipped with modchips from using those services xbox live terms of use , section 14 in an effort to dissuade modchip creation , some console manufacturers included the option to run homebrew software or even an alternative operating system on their consoles the court ruled that even though the retailer claimed the products could be used for homebrew , thus asserting exemptions for maintaining interoperability , the court ruled that because nintendo offers development kits for its platforms , interoperability could be achieved without breaching tpms , and thus the defence is invalid instead , the software of a device or its internal part is modified in order to change the device 's behaviour .
