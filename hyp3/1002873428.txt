the most frequently used chemicals during world war i were tear gas rather than fatal or disabling poisons during world war i , the french army was the first to employ tear gas , using 26 & nbsp ; mm grenades filled with ethyl bromoacetate in august 1914 the stocks were rapidly consumed and by november a new order was placed by the french military the first instance of large-scale use of gas as a weapon was on 31 january 1915 , when germany fired 18,000 artillery shells containing liquid xylyl bromide tear gas on russian positions on the rawka river , west of warsaw during the battle of bolimov the first killing agent was chlorine , used by the german military it may appear from a feldpost letter of major karl von zingler that the first chlorine gas attack by german forces took place before 2 january 1915 : '' in other war theatres it does not go better and it has been said that our chlorine is very effective this letter must be discounted as evidence for early german use of chlorine , however , because the date '' 2 january 1915 '' may have been hastily scribbled instead of the intended '' 2 january 1916 , '' the sort of common typographical error that is often made at the beginning of a new year the deaths of so many english officers from gas at this time would certainly have been met with outrage , but a recent , extensive study of british reactions to chemical warfare says nothing of this supposed attack the british official history stated that at hill 60 , '' 90 men died from gas poisoning in the trenches or before they could be got to a dressing station ; of the 207 brought to the nearest dressing stations , 46 died almost immediately and 12 after long suffering in response , the artillery branch of the russian army organised a commission to study the delivery of poison gas in shells it quickly became evident that the men who stayed in their places suffered less than those who ran away , as any movement worsened the effects of the gas , and that those who stood up on the fire step suffered less—indeed they often escaped any serious effects—than those who lay down or sat at the bottom of a trench chlorine was less effective as a weapon than the germans had hoped , particularly as soon as simple countermeasures were introduced because such pads could not be expected to arrive at the front for several days , army divisions set about making them for themselves the british expressed outrage at germany 's use of poison gas at ypres and responded by developing their own gas warfare capability soldiers who claimed to have been exposed to chemical warfare have often presented unusual medical conditions which has led to much controversy some us veterans who were closely affected by chemical weapons showed no neurological evidence in the following years these same studies showed that one single contact with chemical weapons would be enough to cause long-term health effects
