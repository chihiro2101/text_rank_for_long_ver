they generally use the intermediate value theorem , which asserts that if a continuous function has values of opposite signs at the end points of an interval , then the function has at least one root in the interval they lead to efficient algorithms for real-root isolation of polynomials , which ensure finding all real roots with a guaranteed accuracy the false position method , also called the regula falsi method , is similar to the bisection method , but instead of using bisection search 's middle of the interval it uses the -intercept of the line that connects the plotted function values at the endpoints of the interval , that is : c \frac , that is a slower convergence than with three steps of newton 's method if the given polynomial only has real coefficients , one may wish to avoid computations with complex numbers the simple durandâ€“kerner and the slightly more complicated aberth method simultaneously find all of the roots using only simple complex number arithmetic this method is useful for finding the roots of polynomials of high degree to arbitrary precision ; it has almost optimal complexity in this setting methods for finding all complex roots , such as aberth method can provide the real roots it follows that the standard way of computing real roots is to compute first disjoint intervals , called isolating intervals , such that each one contains exactly one real root , and together they contain all the roots having isolating interval , one may use fast numerical methods , such as newton 's method for improving the precision of the result with these improvements they reach a computational complexity that is similar to that of the best algorithms for computing all the roots ( even when all roots are real ) however , for polynomials whose coefficients are exactly given as integers or rational numbers , there is an efficient method to factorize them into factors that have only simple roots and whose coefficients are also exactly given
