he started to write stories , plays , and essays in earnest – a long '' sequel '' to man and superman made him consider himself to be 'shaw 's natural successor during this traumatic period , wilson was continually working and reworking the novel that was eventually published as ritual in the dark ( 1960 ) skidelsky , robert oswald mosley p.503 , p.511 , lodestar no.1-winter 1985/86 , no.4-autumn/winter 1986 , no.7-winter 1987/88 , no.8-spring 1988 , no.9-summer 1988 , no.11-spring 1989 , no.12-summer 1989 the success of the outsider notwithstanding , wilson 's second book , religion and the rebel ( 1957 ) , was universally panned by critics although wilson himself claimed it was a more comprehensive book than the first one colin wilson , the angry years robson books , 2007 undaunted , wilson continued to expound his positive '' new '' existentialism in the six philosophical books known as '' the outsider cycle '' , all written within the first ten years of his literary career when the book was re-printed in 1980 as the new existentialism , wilson wrote : '' if i have contributed anything to existentialism – or , for that matter , to twentieth century thought in general , here it is wilson was also known for what he termed '' existential criticism '' , which suggested that a work of art should not just be judged by the principles of literary criticism or theory alone but also by what it has to say , in particular about the meaning and purpose of existence he also applied existential criticism to many of the hundreds of book reviews he wrote for journals including books & bookmen , the literary review , the london magazine , john o'london 's , the spectator and the aylesford review throughout his career some of these were gathered together in a book entitled existential criticism : selected book reviews , published in 2009 meanwhile , the prolific wilson found time to write about other subjects that interested him , even on occasion when his level of expertise might be questionable may not one lost soul be permitted to abstain ? ” by the late 1960s wilson had become increasingly interested in metaphysics and occult themes in his later work he suggests the possibility of afterlife and the existence of spirits , which he personally analyses as an active member of the ghost club he wrote : like some of his non-fiction work , many of wilson 's novels from ritual in the dark ( 1960 ) onwards have been concerned with the psychology of murder—especially that of serial killing lovecraft as '' sick '' and as '' a bad writer '' who had '' rejected reality '' —but he grudgingly praised lovecraft 's story '' the shadow out of time '' as capable science fiction in the preface to the mind parasites , wilson concedes that lovecraft , '' far more than hemingway or faulkner , or even kafka , is a symbol of the outsider-artist in the 20th century '' and asks : '' what would have happened if lovecraft had possessed a private income—enough , say , to allow him to spend his winters in italy and his summers in greece or switzerland ? '' answering that in his wilson 's opinion '' he would undoubtedly have produced less , but what he did produce would have been highly polished , without the pulp magazine cliches that disfigure so much of his work critic nicolas tredell wrote : '' the twenty-first century may look back on colin wilson as one of the novelists who foresaw the future of fiction , and something , perhaps , of the future of man the psychologist dorothy rowe gave wilson 's book men of mystery a negative review and wrote that it '' does nothing to advance research into the paranormal '' in 2016 the first full-length biography of wilson , reviewing his entire life 's work , beyond the robot : the life and work of colin wilson , by gary lachman , appeared it received a positive endorsement from philip pullman , who wrote that '' wilson was always far better and more interesting than fashionable opinion claimed , and in lachman he has found a biographer who can respond to the whole range of his work with sympathy and understanding , in a style which , like wilson 's own , is always immensely readable '' michael dirda in the washington post called wilson a '' controversial writer who explored the nature of human consciousness in dozens of books '' and said that lachman , a '' leading student of the western esoteric tradition , writes with '' exceptional grace , forcefulness , and clarity brett taylor '' enjoyed '' the biography , but said that '' a more critical author might have written a book that argued for the subject 's worth in a broader and more convincing context '' the frenchman '' ( short story , evening standard 22 august 1957 ) ritual in the dark ( victor gollancz , 1960 ) ( reprinted , valancourt books , 2013 ) adrift in soho ( 1961 ) '' watching the bird '' ( short story , evening news 12 september 1961 ) '' uncle tom and the police constable '' ( short story , evening news 23 october 1961 ) '' he could not fail '' ( short story , evening news 29 december 1961 ) '' uncle and the lion '' ( short story , evening news 28 september 1962 ) '' hidden bruise '' ( short story , evening news 3 december 1962 ) '' the wooden cubes '' ( short story , evening news 27 june 1963 ) man without a shadow ( us title the sex diary of gerard sorme ) ( 1963 ) ( reprinted , valancourt books , 2013 ) the world of violence ( us title the violent world of hugh greene ) ( 1963 ) ( reprinted , valancourt books , 2013 ) necessary doubt ( 1964 ) ( reprinted , valancourt books , 2014 ) the glass cage ( 1966 ) ( reprinted , valancourt books , 2014 ) the mind parasites ( 1967 ) the philosopher 's stone ( 1969 ) ( reprinted , valancourt books , 2013 ) the return of the lloigor ( first published 1969 in the anthology tales of the cthulhu mythos ;
