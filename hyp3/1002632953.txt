labels requiring high quality have generally been printed using the offset process until recently the greatest advances in flexographic printing have been in the area of photopolymer printing plates , including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation laser-etched ceramic anilox rolls along with chambered ink systems , have also played a part in the improvement of print quality full-color picture printing is now possible , and some of the finer presses available today , in combination with a skilled operator , allow quality that rivals the lithography process the process can differ depending on whether solid sheets of photopolymer or liquid photopolymer are used , but the principle is still the same the first step is to create a metal plate out of the negative of our initial image through an exposition process ( followed by an acid bath ) this metal plate in relief is then used in the second step to create the mold that could be in bakelite board or even glass or plastic , through a first molding process once cooled , this master mold will press the rubber or plastic compound ( under both controlled temperature and pressure ) through a second molding process to create the printing plate or cliche mounting for every colour to be printed , a plate is made and eventually put on a cylinder which is placed in the printing press to make a complete picture , regardless of printing on flexible film or corrugated paper , the image transferred from each plate has to register exactly with the images transferred from the other colors for simplicity we 'll refer to print sleeves throughout this module but you can substitute cylinders if these are used in your operation positioning is achieved by correctly lining up register marks that are common to each plate in the set types of registration marks these are various types of mark used for aligning the plates correctly : registration crosses are commonly used but need to be positioned in waste areas as they are easily seen on the print , they can also be used as a guide for aligning the print to a bag or box structure if this is required the plate is then adhered to the sleeve using a mounting tape ( see item 5 ) and the complete unit removed from the mounting machine the same principle is applied for multiple plates across the sleeve and so either two cameras per plate are used or two cameras are used which move into the correct position driven by servo motors and camera setting software to step plates around the sleeve to minimise risk of bounce is done either mechanically using an index disc or by use of stepper motors to drive and lock it in position each plate is mounted on a double sided adhesive tape - there are many types of mounting tape and it is important to use the correct thickness and hardness adhesive type also needs to be correct for your mounting process ( see tape features ) the tape is applied to the sleeve being careful to lay it on without trapping air underneath it ( must be flat to sleeve ) the plate is carefully positioned over tape , usually by hand so that the register marks are seen directly below the cameras these include tables to lay the plate on to make maneuvering the plate into position simpler , lay down ( pressure ) rollers to eliminate air bubble inclusions , tape application options , plate and tape cutting options and moving cameras , replacing multiple camera mounting systems printing a flexographic print is made by creating a positive mirrored master of the required image as a 3d relief in a rubber or polymer material then it transfers to the anilox or ceramic roll ( or meter roll ) whose texture holds a specific amount of ink since it is covered with thousands of small wells or cups that enable it to meter ink to the printing plate in a uniform thickness evenly and quickly ( the number of cells per linear inch can vary according to the type of print job and the quality required ) international paper - knowledge center - flexography : to avoid getting a final product with a smudgy or lumpy look , it must be ensured that the amount of ink on the printing plate is not excessive the ink system contains an ink pump , anilox roll and either a fountain roll system or doctor blade system the fountain roll or two-roll system has one roll spinning in an ink pan pressed against the anilox roll to transfer a layer of ink to then be applied to the printing plate this system is best used for low quality print such as flood coats and block lettering due to its inability to produce a clean wipe of the anilox roll the single blade system uses an open ink pan with a roller that is then sheared with one doctor blade to create a uniform layer of ink to be distributed this system is best used for low to mid quality print work - usually found in corrugated box printing the dual blade system is an enclosed system that has one doctor blade for doctoring the ink and one containment blade that contains the ink in the chamber and allows ink from the anilox roll back in dual blade systems require 2 end seals and adequate chamber pressure in order to maintain the tight seal between the ink chamber and the anilox roll this system is best used for high quality , intricate print designs , like those found in the label industry flexo has an advantage over lithography in that it can use a wider range of inks , water based rather than oil based inks , and is good at printing on a variety of different materials like plastic , foil , acetate film , brown paper , and other materials used in packaging
