and juve contre fantômas appeared in 1987 under the title the silent executioner , with an introduction by american artist edward gorey his later serial les vampires , which concerns the eponymous crime syndicate ( and not actual vampires ) is also reminiscent of the fantômas series there was a 1920 20-episode american fantômas serial directed by edward sedgwick starring edward roseman as fantômas , which bore little resemblance to the french series it was partially released in france ( 12 episodes only ) under the title les exploits de diabolos ( the exploits of diabolos ) a novelization of this serial was written by david lee white for black coat press under the title fantômas in america in 2007 fantômas also has a cameo appearance in the czech children 's series lucie , postrach ulice as a tv character , where he resembles his original 1911 book serial covers ' depiction a daily '' fantômas '' strip drawn by pierre tabary was syndicated by opera mundi from november 1957 to march 1958 ( 192 strips in total ) , adapting the first two novels during the 1960s the mexican comics publisher editorial novaro produced a fantomas , la amenaza elegante ( fantomas , the elegant menace ) comic book series that became popular throughout latin america this was apparently meant to be the same character , although rewritten as a hero his mask in the latin american version – which was clearly inspired by the black mask worn by the italian comic book criminal diabolik — and his use of it , seems to have been influenced by the popular images generated by lucha libre apparently the series was also influenced by the james bond movies , as fantômas , equipped with advanced technology created by a scientist called professor semo , had all kind of adventures around the world , and even fought other , more cruel criminals although cancelled years ago ( novaro folded in 1985 , and a character revival by rival grupo editorial vid in mexico in the 1990s did not last long ) , it is from this mexican comic that the character is best known in both central america and south america fantômas continues to be one of latin america 's favorite comic characters a fantômas short story by paul kupperberg and roy mann appeared in captain action comics no the second third of the novella was published in awesome tales no the fantômas novels and the subsequent films were highly regarded by the french avant-garde of the day , particularly by the surrealism after their success fantômas had a short appearance in two popular soviet comedies : seven old men and one girl ( 1968 ) and grandads-robbers ( 1972 ) fantômas may well have been influenced by its less well remembered predecessor , zigomar , the creation of , which first appeared as a serial in le matin in 1909 , then as a pulp magazine ( 28 issues ) in 1913 , and again in zigomar contre zigomar for eight more issues in 1924 the 1915 adventure film filibus was probably inspired largely by the popularity of fantômas , although the film 's title character , a female air pirate , strongly resembles arsène lupin after the success of the first fantômas film serial directed by louis feuillade , gaumont produced another serial directed by feuillade in the same style , les vampires , about a gang of criminals as feuillade had been criticized for glorifying outlaws , his next serial for gaumont , judex , starred this time a positive hero , a mysterious avenger conceived as an honest version of fantômas the original judex serial was released in the united states and appears to have been an inspiration for the american pulp character the shadow , who was himself an inspiration for batman 69-73 fantômas has appeared in an unauthorized fashion in two french stage plays : nick carter vs a number of italian dark villains of the 1960s were clearly influenced by fantômas the british film critic and writer kim newman has argued that fantômas inspired the pink panther film series starring peter sellers in france , the character is known as fantomiald ;
