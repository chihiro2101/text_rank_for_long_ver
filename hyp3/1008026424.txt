since its inception in 1911 , the race has always been scheduled on or around memorial day the sunday of memorial day weekend is widely considered one of the most important days on the motorsports calendar , as it is the day of the indianapolis 500 , the coca-cola 600 , and ( currently ) the monaco grand prix practice and time trials are held in the two weeks leading up to the race , while miscellaneous preliminary testing is held as early as april from the 1970s to the 1990s , indianapolis was often the second or third race of the season , and as late as the 1950s , it was sometimes the first championship event of the year due to the high prestige of the indianapolis 500—rivaling or even surpassing the season championship—it is not uncommon for some teams and drivers to focus heavily on preparing for that race during the early part of the season , and not focus fully on the championship battle until after indy the indianapolis 500 , as well as other indycar series races , does not utilize the green–white–checker finish in case of a late-race yellow the '' indy-only '' entries , also known as '' one-offs '' , may be an extra car added to an existing full-time team , or a part-time team altogether that does not enter any of the other races , or enters only a few selected races it is not uncommon for some drivers ( particularly former indy 500 winners ) to quit full-time driving during the season , but race solely at indy for numerous years afterward before entering full retirement the crowds grew progressively smaller for the rest of the season , however , so the track owners chose to focus on a single race , and considered a 24-hour contest , in the fashion of le mans , or a event the first '' 500 '' was held at the speedway in 1911 on memorial day , may 30 , ( as it was known from its inception in 1868 to 1967 , when federal law made '' memorial day '' the official name ) , run to a maximum engine size formula although the first race was won by an american driver at the wheel of an american car , european makers such as the italy fiat or france peugeot companies soon developed their vehicles to try to win the event , which they did from 1912 to 1919 however , the speedway has returned to a standard singer starting in 2017 , with jim cornelison doing it for three races as of the 2019 race the engines powered another seven winners until 1938 ( two of them , 1930 and 1932 , in miller chassis ) , then ran at first with stock-type motors before later being adjusted to the international 3.0-liter formula meanwhile , european manufacturers , gone from the indianapolis 500 for nearly two decades , made a brief return just before world war ii , with the competitive maserati 8ctf allowing wilbur shaw to become the first driver to win consecutively at indianapolis , in 1939 and 1940 with the 500 having been a part of the world drivers ' championship between 1950 and 1960 , ferrari made a discreet appearance at the 1952 event with alberto ascari , but european entries were few and far between during those days it was not until the indianapolis 500 was removed from the world championship calendar that european entries made their return in 1963 , technical innovator colin chapman brought his team lotus to indianapolis for the first time , attracted by the large monetary prizes , far bigger than the usual at a european event racing a mid-engined car , scotland jim clark was second in his first attempt in 1963 , dominating in 1964 until suffering suspension failure on lap 47 , and completely dominating the race in 1965 , a victory which also interrupted the success of the offy , and giving the 4.2-liter ford v8 its first success at the race american drivers continued to fill the majority of entries at the brickyard in the following years , but european technology had taken over after foreign cars became the norm , foreign drivers began competing in the indianapolis 500 regularly , choosing the united states as their primary base for their motor racing activities foreign-born drivers became a regular fixture of indianapolis in the years to follow despite the increase in foreign drivers commonly being associated with the cart era , four of the first six indianapolis 500 winners were non-american drivers however , from its inception , the race has been widely known as the indianapolis 500 or , more simply as '' the 500 '' often the race was also advertised on the radio as the '' annual memorial day race , '' or similar variations for the 1981 race , the name '' 65th indianapolis 500-mile race '' was officially adopted , with all references as the '' international sweepstakes '' dropped around that same time , in the wake of the 1979 entry controversy , and the formation of cart , the race changed to an invitational event , rather than an open , rendering the '' sweepstakes '' description inappropriate for nearly a century , the race eschewed any sort of naming rights or title sponsor , a move , though uncommon in the modern sports world , that was well received by fans this tradition finally ended in 2016 when a presenting sponsor , penngrade , was added for the first time it is the first time since 1980 that the '' sweepstakes '' title has been used from 1950 to 1960 , the indianapolis 500 also counted toward the fia 's world championship of drivers ( now synonymous with formula one ) , although few drivers participated in the other races of that series his appearance in 1952 in a ferrari was also the only time a ferrari has ever appeared in the race soon after the death of tony hulman in 1977 , and the loss of several key usac officials in a 1978 plane crash , several key team owners banded together and formed cart in late 1978 to sanction the sport of indy car racing for the next three years , the race was not officially recognized on the cart calendar , but the cart teams and drivers comprised the field in response to cart 's 1996 schedule that put several races in direct conflict with the first indy racing league events , george announced that 25 of the 33 starting positions at the 1996 indy 500 would be reserved for the top 25 cars in irl points standings this effectively left eight starting positions open to the cart-regulars that chose not to participate in the irl races and would be the first time that not all 33 spots were open for qualification in the history of the race the move made it such that the irl utilized different and incompatible equipment from cart ; no cart-based teams would enter the indy 500 for the next three years cart would run a 300-mile race gateway motorsports park on the saturday of memorial day weekend from 1997–1999 to avoid a conflict in early 2008 , the two series were unified to create a single open-wheel championship after a 12-year split being run under indy racing league/ims control—known as the indycar series in the 1960s and early 1970s , the indy 500 and the world 600 ( now known as the coca-cola 600 ) at charlotte motor speedway were held on different days of the week from 1974 to 1992 , the two events were scheduled for the same day and same starting time , making participation in both impossible a few stock car drivers during that time , namely neil bonnett in 1979 , nevertheless still attempted to qualify at indy , even if that meant skipping charlotte altogether in 2001 , tony stewart became the first driver to complete the full race distance ( 1,100 miles ) in both races on the same day this significantly closed the window for a driver to be able to race both events on the same day ( the race 's original starting time had been set at 11 a.m teams may enter up to two machines under a given car number—the '' primary '' car and a '' backup '' car for example , the two cars for the 2 team would be numbered 2 and 2t additionally , as the month wears on , a '' t car '' may be split off into a separate entry , and reassigned a new number , or be sold to another team in addition , the officials designate a certain lap after which cars off the track being serviced/repaired are no longer permitted to return to the race throughout the years , the race has used several different qualifying procedures the current four-lap ( ten-mile ) qualifying distance was first introduced in 1920 and has been used every year since 1939 '' bump day '' and '' pole day '' were moved the second day of qualifying and drivers who qualified in positions 10-30 will be locked into the field on day one on the weekend before the race ( saturday and sunday ) , all cars are entered into a blind draw for the qualifying order at the end of the session , the fastest nine drivers advance to a '' shootout '' session held on the next day to determine pole position and the first three rows of the grid drivers who qualify 31st and lower advance to a separate '' shootout '' session also held on the next day to determine the final three spots on the grid the fastest driver wins the highly coveted pole position and the remaining eight drivers have their positions locked in based on their times ( the series will wave off the run if it is obvious the run will not be fast enough to qualify and it is getting late in the day radio coverage of the race dates back to 1922 in 2016 , the ims declared a sell-out of race tickets for the 100th running of the event , meaning that wrtv would be allowed to air the race live for the first time since 1950 in contrast with the usual sell-out policy , in 2020 , the race aired live on wthr , as ims owner roger penske announced on april 4 there would be no public admission for any of the year 's events due to a rise in covid-19 cases in the state
