cobe would have to operate for a minimum of 6 months , and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground , cobe and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the earth , sun and moon the need to control systematic error in the measurement of the cmb anisotropy and measuring the zodiacal cloud at different elongation angles for subsequent modeling required that the satellite rotate at a 0.8 rpm spin rate the spin axis is also tilted back from the orbital velocity vector as a precaution against possible deposits of residual atmospheric gas on the optics as well against the infrared glow that would result from fast neutral particles hitting its surfaces at extremely high speed these wheels were used to carry an angular momentum opposite that of the entire spacecraft in order to create a zero net angular momentum system the orbit combined with the spin axis made it possible to keep the earth and the sun continually below the plane of the shield , allowing a full sky scan every six months in particular , the florence group claimed a detection of intermediate angular scale anisotropies at the level 100 microkelvins in agreement with later measurements made by the boomerang experiment firas measurements were made by measuring the spectral difference between a 7° patch of the sky against an internal black body the dmr was able to spend four years mapping the detectable anisotropy of cosmic background radiation as it was the only instrument not dependent on the dewar 's supply of helium to keep it cooled this operation was able to create full sky maps of the cmb by subtracting out galactic emissions and dipole at various frequencies galaxies that were detected at the 140 and 240 μm were also able to provide information on very cold dust ( vcd ) when these data were joined with 60 and 100 μm data taken from iras , it was found that the far-infrared luminosity arises from cold ( ≈17–22 k ) dust associated with diffuse hi cirrus clouds , 15-30 % from cold ( ≈19 k ) dust associated with molecular gas , and less than 10 % from warm ( ≈29 k ) dust in the extended low-density hii regions a direct measurement of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) can also provide important constraints on the integrated cosmological history of star formation , metal and dust production , and the conversion of starlight into infrared emissions by dust cobe observations provide important constraints on the cosmic star formation rate , and help us calculate the ebl spectrum for various star formation histories observation made by cobe require that star formation rate at redshifts of z ≈ 1.5 to be larger than that inferred from uv-optical observations by a factor of 2
