much life extension research focuses on nutrition—diets or supplements— although there is little evidence that they have an effect the free-radical theory of aging suggests that antioxidant supplements might extend human life he cites francis bacon ( 1561–1626 ) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life , noting bacon 's novel new atlantis , wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life robert boyle ( 1627–1691 ) , founding member of the royal society , also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension , according to hughes , and proposed such experiments as '' to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young '' university researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging '' harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process '' though many scientists state that life extension and radical life extension are possible , there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension they aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies , and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension , and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people he states his opposition to life extension with the words : john harris , former editor-in-chief of the journal of medical ethics , argues that as long as life is worth living , according to the person himself , we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them ( 2007 ) enhancing evolution : the ethical case for making better people a spring 2013 pew research poll in the united states found that 38 % of americans would want life extension treatments , and 56 % would reject it however , it also found that 68 % believed most people would want it and that only 4 % consider an '' ideal lifespan '' to be more than 120 years 41 % of americans believed that radical life extension ( rle ) would be good for society , while 51 % said they believed it would be bad for society one possibility for why 56 % of americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude , and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy david sinclair says : '' i & nbsp ; do n't see aging as a disease , but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body '' the two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not the discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications one view is , this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the united states of america , it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the fda a 2009 review of longevity research noted : '' extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best , and it can not be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors from an evolutionary perspective , mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity , and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan moreover , the very notion of a '' life-extension factor '' that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology there are a number of chemicals intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in animal models other attempts to create anti-aging drugs have taken different research paths future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would , in theory , be possible to ( as feynman put it ) '' swallow the doctor '' some life extensionists suggest that therapeutic cloning and stem cell research could one day provide a way to generate cells , body parts , or even entire bodies ( generally referred to as reproductive cloning ) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient recently , the us department of defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques in july 2020 scientists , using public biological data on 1.75 m people with known lifespans overall , identify 10 genomic loci which appear to intrinsically influence healthspan , lifespan , and longevity – of which half have not been reported previously at genome-wide significance and most being associated with cardiovascular disease – and identify haem metabolism as a promising candidate for further research within the field their study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce , and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans it is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life therefore , to extend life , we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on , and we should be able to do so by '' identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging some scientists believe that the dead may one day be '' resurrected '' through simulation technology the alleged benefits of the treatment , none of which have been demonstrated in a proper study , include a longer life , darker hair , better memory , better sleep , curing heart diseases , diabetes and alzheimer the approach is based on parabiosis studies such as irina conboy do on mice , but conboy says young blood does not reverse aging ( even in mice ) and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research neuroscientist tony wyss-coray , who also studied blood exchanges on mice as recently as 2014 , said people offering those treatments are '' basically abusing people 's trust '' and that young blood treatments are '' the scientific equivalent of fake news ''
