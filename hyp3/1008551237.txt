the ears have been described both as erect but later described as hanging due to interbreeding with european dogs , but the most distinctive feature was the length of hair often growing in the reverse direction along its back within 53 years of the first dutch settlements in southern africa , the europeans were using these local dogs themselves similarly , in 1952 , the rhodesian ridgeback club of great britain was founded at crufts to promote the breed around the united kingdom to show judges , so a standard for the breed might be recognised it is believed to originate from the dog used by the original african dog population which had a similar ridge the presence of black guard hairs or ticking is not addressed in the akc standard , although the elaboration of the akc standard notes the amount of black or dark brown in the coat should not be excessive the fci standard states that excessive black hairs throughout the coat are highly undesirable it is not as common as a black nose ; some breeders believe the inclusion of brown noses in a breeding program is necessary for maintaining the vibrancy of the coat should never be administered to these dogs , especially when they are young this term refers to the purebred offspring of heterozygous parental animals that do not inherit a copy of the ridge mutation from either parent and are , in effect , normal dogs without a ridged back however , while the few studies that have analyzed the issue do not agree on the incidence of ridgelessness within the breed , they all show a ridgeless rate significantly lower than 25 % , which can not be explained using the punnett square model for single gene/two allele inheritance one possible reason for these studies to deviate from the expected 25 % incidence of ridgelessness is inclusion of parents who were not heterozygous ( possessing a copy of both the ridgeless and ridged allele ) in the study the inclusion of homozygotes ( possessing two copies of the ridged alleles ) would make the observed incidence be less than 25 % when averaged across the population in the study note that many matings are required to have a high probability of detecting a homozygous dominant ( once a ridgeless pup is produced , the animal in question is assumed to be heterozygous without question ) , and more than one sire can produce the pups in one litter the latter fact can cast doubt on the calling of male heterozygotes by this method and could possibly lead to the results shown in studies testing the mode of inheritance of ridgelessness according to the test results in practice , it appears that the ridge genetics in rhodesian ridgebacks is not so simple and is characterized by incomplete manifestation of ridge gene ( more info here ) also great majority ( > 95 % ) of heterozygotes ( r/r ) have ridge , but few ( and that '' mismarked '' puppies will only ever be sold on condition that they are never shown , and are neutered response to bbc programme '' pedigree dogs exposed '' the rhodesian ridgeback club of great britain it was only after the publicity surrounding the promotion of culling that they reversed their code of ethics to say '' no healthy puppy will be culled '' the ridgeback ranks number six in terms of most affected breeds for thyroid problems recorded by the orthopedic foundation for animals slightly less than 5 % of ridgebacks were reported to be affected with the condition in a us breed club survey the disease progresses to the point where the animal can no longer stand or walk on its own progression has been known to take as little as six months , or several years hypothyroidism is a growing problem in the rhodesian ridgeback , and this condition causes a multitude of symptoms , including weight gain and hair loss
