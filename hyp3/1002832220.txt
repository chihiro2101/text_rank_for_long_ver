mary 's magnificat , recorded only in luke 's gospel , is one of four hymns , distilled from a collection of early jewish-christian canticles , which complement the promise-fulfillment theme of luke 's nativity of jesus in form and content , these four canticles are patterned on the '' hymns of praise '' in israel 's psalter the first stanza displays graphically a characteristic feature of hebrew poetry—synonymous parallelism—in ascribing praise to god : '' my soul '' mirrors '' my spirit '' ; '' proclaims the greatness '' with '' has found gladness '' ; '' of the lord '' with '' in god my savior although there is some scholarly discussion of whether the historical mary herself actually proclaimed this canticle , luke portrays her as the singer of this song of reversals and the interpreter of the contemporary events taking place along with the benedictus , as well as several old testament canticles , the magnificat is included in the book of odes , an ancient liturgical collection found in some manuscripts of the septuagint as with other canticles and psalms , western liturgical tradition usually adds the doxology known as gloria patri to the end of the magnificat in a style reminiscent of old testament poetry and song , mary praises the lord in alignment with this structure : mary rejoices that she has the privilege of giving birth to the promised messiah : from this day all generations will call me blessed , : the almighty has done great things for me , : and holy is his name in eastern orthodox worship , the ode of the theotokos is accompanied by the following refrain sung between the verses ( a sticheron ) and a megalynarion , which is the second part of the axion estin hymn : : τὴν τιμιωτέραν τῶν χερουβὶμ καὶ ἐνδοξοτέραν ἀσυγκρίτως τῶν σεραφίμ , τὴν ἀδιαφθόρως θεὸν λόγον τεκοῦσαν , τὴν ὄντως θεοτόκον , σὲ μεγαλύνομεν the text forms a part of the daily office in the roman catholic vespers service , the lutheran vespers service , and the anglican services of evening prayer , according to both the book of common prayer and common worship in the book of common prayer evening prayer service , it is usually paired with the the book of common prayer allows for an alternative to the magnificat—the psalm 98—and some anglican rubrics allow for a wider selection of canticles , but the magnificat and remain the most popular in orthodox liturgical practice , the magnificat is always sung during the matins service before the irmos of the ninth ode of the canon most compositions were originally intended for liturgical use , especially for vesper services and celebrations of the visitation , but some are also performed in concert since the canticles are sung every day at some cathedrals , charles villiers stanford wrote a magnificat in every major key , and herbert howells published 18 settings over his career , including magnificat and nunc dimittis for st paul 's cathedral an eastern orthodox setting of the magnificat ( text in latin and english ) is to be found in the 2011 all-night vigil ( section 11 ) by the english composer clive strutt
