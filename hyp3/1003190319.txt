one sort of public time signal is a striking clock until modern times , a public clock such as big ben was the only time standard the general public needed in many midwestern us cities where tornadoes are a common hazard , the emergency sirens are tested regularly at a specified time ( say , noon each saturday ) ; while not primarily intended to mark the time , local people often check their watches when they hear this signal telegraph signals were used regularly for time coordination by the united states naval observatory starting in 1865 observatories were selling accurate time by offering a regional time signal service a march 1905 issue of the technical world describes the role of the united states naval observatory as a source of time signals : : one of the most important functions of the naval observatory is found in the daily distribution of the correct time to every portion of the united states the electrical impulse which goes forth from the observatory at noon each day , now sets or regulates automatically more than 70,000 clocks located in all parts of the united states , and also serves , in each of the larger cities of the country , to release a time-ball located on some lofty building of central location there are dedicated radio time signal stations around the world kenneth seidelmann time : from earth rotation to atomic physics , wiley-vch , 2009 , page 256 radio time signal stations broadcast the time in both audible and machine-readable time code form that can be used as references for radio clocks and radio-controlled watches the time announcements are normally delayed by less than 30 ms when using land lines from within the continental united states , and the stability ( delay variation ) is generally in the united states many information-based radio stations ( full-service , all-news and news/talk ) also broadcast time signals at the beginning of the hour thus , network-generated time signals and service cues will also be delayed by about eight seconds ( for this reason , when wben-am in buffalo , new york was broadcasting time markers and was simulcast on an fm station that broadcast in hd , the fm signal did not carry the time signal ; wben does not broadcast in hd ) however , due to buffering of the digital broadcast on some computers , this signal may be delayed as much as 20 seconds from the actual start of the hour ( this is presumably the same situation for all cbs radio stations , as each station 's digital stream is produced and distributed in a similar manner ) , though unlike program content which is on a broadcast delay for content concerns , the time signal airs as-is over-the-air , meaning it can sometimes be talked over during a live news event or sports play-by-play kyw-am in philadelphia broadcasts a time signal at the top of the hour along with its jingle in australia , many information-based radio stations broadcast time signals at the beginning of the hour , and a speaking clock service was also available until october 2019 american practical navigator car radio , radio data system ( rds ) clock signal extended data services and pbs greenwich time signal low frequency , ( lf ) smart personal objects technology , ( spot ) speaking clock synchronization vbi , vitc wwvb time synchronization in north america time transfer time and frequency transfer time synchronization travel downunder mentions the time cannon at perth durr cannon research projects : mentions the time cannon at cape town the vng user 's consortium is working on ways to solve the problem of the lack of accurate time signals in australia the edinburgh time gun distribution of time signals by the u.s naval observatory distributed time service , an upgrade to current time station technology receiving , identifying and decoding time signals by nick hacko , vk2dx
