this appears to be the intended meaning , since in the mysterious island , when cyrus smith addresses him as captain nemo , the latter replies , '' i have no name ! '' chief among the few details of nemo 's history given in twenty thousand leagues under the seas are his hatred of imperialism and his grief over the loss of his loved ones in years past after the indian rebellion of 1857 , in which dakkar lost both his family and his kingdom , the prince devoted himself to scientific research , ultimately building the nautilus and cruising the seven seas with a crew of devoted followers , by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the cretan revolt ( 1866–1869 ) against the island 's turkish rulers … by saving ( both physically and financially ) a ceylonese or tamil pearl diver from a shark attack … by rescuing the castaways in twenty thousand leagues under the seas … and by covertly protecting another set of castaways in the mysterious island nemo 's characteristics are largely presented through the observations of professor pierre aronnax , narrator of twenty thousand leagues under the seas he insists that terrestrial laws no longer apply to him , exclaiming in one scene : nemo is devoted to his crew and grieves deeply when members are killed after a mysterious collision with a surface vessel or during a giant squid attack in the caribbean sea he demonstrates his linguistic ability in twenty thousand leagues under the sea , when arronax and two other character speak to him in french , english , german , and latin and he understands all four languages nemo also invents a new language that he and his crew use to communicate with each other even so , captain nemo claims to be extremely wealthy , boasting that '' without the slightest trouble i could pay off the two-billion-dollar french national debt ! '' nemo later tells aronnax that he will enclose his scientific findings and autobiography in a small unsinkable container : '' the last one of us left on the nautilus will throw that container into the sea , and it will drift wherever the waves take it '' subsequently , however , a rather different container does wash ashore in the mysterious island , bearing tools , firearms , navigational instruments , an atlas , books , blank paper , and even clothing throughout the same book , nemo repeatedly acts in this providential way , as when the sailor pencroff pines for tobacco , then the young naturalist harbert identifies some of the island 's plant life the mysterious island was published in 1875 but is set in the years after the close of the american civil war , i.e described as an elderly man in his late sixties , captain nemo claims in its pages to have conducted his undersea travels some sixteen years earlier than the dates given in the prior novel however the chronological discrepancies between this book and the mysterious island appear to have been present since its publication in most subsequent media adaptations of 20,000 leagues and mysterious island , captain nemo is depicted as a european , in accordance with the earlier of the two novels in the league of extraordinary gentlemen comic series by alan moore , captain nemo 's indian ancestry as prince dakkar is emphasized , yet his religious identity is left ambiguous between hinduism and sikhi
