in later hellenistic greek theatres the proskenion ( προσκήνιον ) was a rather narrow raised stage where solo actors performed , while the greek chorus and musicians remained in the '' orchestra '' in front and below it , and there were often further areas for performing from above and behind the proskenion , on and behind the skene in the greek and roman theatre , no proscenium arch existed , in the modern sense , and the acting space was always fully in the view of the audience however , roman theatres were similar to modern proscenium theatres in the sense that the entire audience had a restricted range of views on the stage—all of which were from the front , rather than the sides or back however , the teatro olimpico 's exact replication of the open and accessible roman stage was the exception rather than the rule in sixteenth-century theatre design while the proscenium arch became an important feature of the traditional european theatre , often becoming very large and elaborate , the original proscaenium front below the stage became plainer what the romans would have called the proscaenium is , in modern theatres with orchestra pits , normally painted black in order that it does not draw attention this emulation of the roman model extended to refer to the stage area as the '' proscenium '' , and some writers have incorrectly referred to the theatre 's scaenae frons as a proscenium , and have even suggested that the central archway in the middle of the scaenae frons was the inspiration for the later development of the full-size proscenium arch there is no evidence at all for this assumption ( indeed , contemporary illustrations of performances at the teatro olimpico clearly show that the action took place in front of the scaenae frons and that the actors were rarely framed by the central archway ) many modern theatres attempt to do away with the fourth wall concept and so are instead designed with a thrust stage that projects out of the proscenium arch and '' reaches '' into the audience ( technically , this can still be referred to as a proscenium theatre because it still contains a proscenium arch , however the term thrust stage is more specific and more widely used ) in dance history , the use of the proscenium arch has affected dance in different ways prior to the use of proscenium stages , early court ballets took place in large chambers where the audience members sat around and above the dance space later on , the use of the proscenium stage for performances established a separation of the audience from the performers it was the beginning of scenography design , and perhaps also it was also the origin of the use of backstage personnel or '' stage hands '' environmental theatre ) : the stage and audience either blend together , or are in numerous or oddly shaped sections
