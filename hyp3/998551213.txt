the person with hyperopia , in an attempt to '' accommodate '' or focus the eyes , converges the eyes as well , as convergence is associated with activation of the accommodation reflex where the degree of error is small , the child will typically be able to maintain control because the amount of over-accommodation required to produce clear vision is also small where the degree of hyperopia is large , the child may not be able to produce clear vision no matter how much extra-accommodation is exerted and thus no incentive exists for the over-accommodation and convergence that can give rise to the onset of esotropia however , where the degree of error is small enough to allow the child to generate clear vision by over-accommodation , but large enough to disrupt their binocular control , esotropia will result where the esotropia is solely a consequence of uncorrected hyperopic refractive error , providing the child with the correct glasses and ensuring that these are worn all the time , is often enough to control the deviation thus , in such cases , even when all underlying hyperopic refractive errors have been corrected , the child will continue to squint when looking at very small objects or reading small print even though they are exerting a normal amount of accommodative or 'focusing ' effort , the amount of convergence associated with this effort is excessive , thus giving rise to esotropia in such cases an additional hyperopic correction is often prescribed in the form of bifocal lenses , to reduce the degree of accommodation , and hence convergence , being exerted it is a constant esotropia of large and consistent size with onset between birth and six months of age the origin of the condition is unknown , and its early onset means that the affected individual 's potential for developing binocular vision is limited these problems may directly affect the extra-ocular muscles themselves , and may also result from conditions affecting the nerve or blood supply to these muscles or the bony orbital structures surrounding them this alteration between the left and right eye is mostly spontaneous , but may be voluntary in some cases where appropriate , prismatic correction can be used , either temporarily or permanently , to relieve symptoms of double vision
