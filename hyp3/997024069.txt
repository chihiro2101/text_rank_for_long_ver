the conjunction aspect ( essentially 0° , discounting orb ) can be in either category , depending on which two planets it is that are conjunct it is important to note that different astrologers and separate astrological systems/traditional utilize differing orbs ( the degree of separation between exactitude ) when calculating and using the aspects , though almost all use a larger orb for a conjunction when compared to the other aspects an orb of approximately 10° is usually considered a conjunction , but if neither the sun nor moon is involved , some consider the conjunction to have a maximum orb of only about 8° conjunctions are said to be the most powerful aspect , mutually intensifying the effects of the planets involved ; they are major point in an individual 's chart if either of two planets involved in a conjunction is also under tension from one or more hard aspects with one or more other planets , then the added presence of the conjunction aspect will further intensify the tension of that hard aspect a planet in very close conjunction to the sun ( within 17 minutes of arc , or only about 0.28° ) is said to be cazimi , an ancient astrological term meaning '' in the heart '' ( of the sun ) in the case of combust , specific orb limit will depend on the particular planet in conjunction with the sun if and designate the periods of jupiter and saturn then the return takes 1/ ( 5/s-2/j ) which comes to 883.15 years , but to be a whole number of conjunction intervals it must be sometimes 913 years and sometimes 854 94 , p.174 even greater importance was attributed to the beginning of a new cycle after all fours trigons had been visited , something which happens in about 900 years medieval astrologers usually gave 960 as the length of the full cycle , apparently because in some cases it took 240 years to pass from one trigon to the next use of the alphonsine tables apparently led to the use of precessing signs , and kepler gave a value of 794 years ( 40 conjunctions ) the square 's energy is strong and usable but has a tension that needs integration between 2 different areas of life , or offers a choice point where an important decision needs to be made that involves an opportunity cost an orb of ±3.5° is usually allowed depending on the planets involved unlike all the other aspects , it does not offer equal divisions of the circle the effect will involve different areas of life being brought together that are not usually in communication since the planets are far enough apart to be in different house quadrants , like the trine , but often with a shift in perspective involving others not previously seen clearly it is the most often used of the minor aspects perhaps for no other reason than it can be easily seen any major aspect transit to a given planetary position will also involve the other planet that is in semi-sextile aspect to it the energetic quality is one of building and potentiating each other gradually , but planets , houses and signs involved must be considered it indicates a strong creative flow of energy between the planets involved , often an opportunity for something performative , entertaining or expressive it is a mystical aspect that indicates a hidden flow of energy between the planets involved , often involving spiritual or energetic sensitivity and an awareness of inner and more subtle , hidden levels of reality involving the planets in septile aspect it is an important minor aspect and indicates a stimulating or challenging energy like that of a square but less intense and more internal the native is thought to have a tendency to seek out those individuals who are not necessarily compatible to them , and this may lead to a sense of tension and actions to correct what to them may be frustration ( some who use the parallel do not consider the contraparallel an aspect
