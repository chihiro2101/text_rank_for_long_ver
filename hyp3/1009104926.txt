the first law of thermodynamics was developed empirically over about half a century a main aspect of the struggle was to deal with the previously proposed caloric theory of heat his law was later recognized as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics , but hess 's statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work in 1842 , julius robert von mayer made a statement that has been rendered by truesdell ( 1980 ) in the words '' in a process at constant pressure , the heat used to produce expansion is universally interconvertible with work '' , but this is not a general statement of the first law the original 19th-century statements of the first law of thermodynamics appeared in a conceptual framework in which transfer of energy as heat was taken as a primitive notion , not defined or constructed by the theoretical development of the framework , but rather presupposed as prior to it and already accepted this framework also took as primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work this framework did not presume a concept of energy in general , but regarded it as derived or synthesized from the prior notions of heat and work by one author , this framework has been called the '' thermodynamic '' approach clausius also stated the law in another form , referring to the existence of a function of state of the system , the internal energy , and expressed it in terms of a differential equation for the increments of a thermodynamic process this equation may be described as follows : : :in a thermodynamic process involving a closed system , the increment in the internal energy is equal to the difference between the heat accumulated by the system and the work done by it bryan wrote about systems between which there is no transfer of matter ( closed systems ) : '' definition when energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work , the energy so transferred is called heat largely through born 's influence , this revised conceptual approach to the definition of heat came to be preferred by many twentieth-century writers energy can also be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another in association with transfer of matter it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another adiabatically as work , and that energy can be held as the internal energy of a thermodynamic system it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another by a path that is non-adiabatic , and is unaccompanied by matter transfer the revised statement of the first law postulates that a change in the internal energy of a system due to any arbitrary process , that takes the system from a given initial thermodynamic state to a given final equilibrium thermodynamic state , can be determined through the physical existence , for those given states , of a reference process that occurs purely through stages of adiabatic work the revised statement is then : :for a closed system , in any arbitrary process of interest that takes it from an initial to a final state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium , the change of internal energy is the same as that for a reference adiabatic work process that links those two states the reference adiabatic work process may be chosen arbitrarily from amongst the class of all such processes this statement is much less close to the empirical basis than are the original statements , but is often regarded as conceptually parsimonious in that it rests only on the concepts of adiabatic work and of non-adiabatic processes , not on the concepts of transfer of energy as heat and of empirical temperature that are presupposed by the original statements born particularly observes that the revised approach avoids thinking in terms of what he calls the '' imported engineering '' concept of heat engines basing his thinking on the mechanical approach , born in 1921 , and again in 1949 , proposed to revise the definition of heat in particular , he referred to the work of constantin carath√©odory , who had in 1909 stated the first law without defining quantity of heat born 's definition was specifically for transfers of energy without transfer of matter , and it has been widely followed in textbooks ( examples : ) born observes that a transfer of matter between two systems is accompanied by a transfer of internal energy that can not be resolved into heat and work components the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system was expressed in two ways by clausius of particular interest for single cycle of a cyclic process are the net work done , and the net heat taken in ( or 'consumed ' , in clausius ' statement ) , by the system in a non-cyclic process , the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to net energy added as heat to the system minus the thermodynamic work done by the system , both being measured in mechanical units these authors actually use the symbols and to denote internal energy but their notation has been changed here to accord with the notation of the present article this usage is described by bailyn as stating the non-convective flow of internal energy , and is listed as his definition number 1 , according to the first law of thermodynamics this usage is also followed by
