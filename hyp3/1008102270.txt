life can be supported only within the active layer since growth and root establishment can occur only in soil that is fully thawed for some part of the year work investigating the permafrost carbon pool size estimates that 1400–1700 gt of carbon is stored in the northern circumpolar permafrost region while a recent study that includes stores of the tibetan plateau , estimates total carbon pools in the permafrost of the northern hemisphere to be 1832 gt the middle zone is permanently frozen as “ permafrost ” , and the bottom layer is where the geothermal temperature is above freezing the extent of permafrost varies with the climate : in the northern hemisphere today , 24 % of the ice-free land area , equivalent to 19 & nbsp ; million square kilometers , is more or less influenced by permafrost beneath the active layer annual temperature swings of permafrost become smaller with depth permafrost typically forms in any climate where the mean annual air temperature is lower than the freezing point of water since all glaciers are warmed at their base by geothermal heat , glacier types , which are near the pressure-melting point throughout , may have liquid water at the interface with the ground and are therefore free of underlying permafrost '' fossil '' cold anomalies in the geothermal gradient in areas where deep permafrost developed during the pleistocene persist down to several hundred metres this is evident from temperature measurements in boreholes in north america and europe thus , if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below , permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered—usually with a northern or southern aspect ( in north and south hemispheres respectively ) —creating discontinuous permafrost usually , permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual soil surface temperature is between in the moist-wintered areas mentioned before , there may not be even discontinuous permafrost down to discontinuous permafrost is often further divided into extensive discontinuous permafrost , where permafrost covers between 50 and 90 percent of the landscape and is usually found in areas with mean annual temperatures between , and sporadic permafrost , where permafrost cover is less than 50 percent of the landscape and typically occurs at mean annual temperatures between -- - > calculations indicate that the time required to form the deep permafrost underlying prudhoe bay , alaska was over a half-million years the table to the right shows that the first hundred metres of permafrost forms relatively quickly but that deeper levels take progressively longer when the ice content of a permafrost exceeds 250 percent ( ice to dry soil by mass ) it is classified as massive ice two categories of massive ground ice are buried surface ice and intrasedimental ice ( also called constitutional ice ) , 2009 intrasedimental ice forms by in-place freezing of subterranean waters and is dominated by segregational ice which results from the crystallizational differentiation taking place during the freezing of wet sediments , accompanied by water migrating to the freezing front intrasedimental or constitutional ice has been widely observed and studied across canada and also includes intrusive and injection ice by definition , permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years the ground can consist of many substrate materials , including bedrock , sediment , organic matter , water or ice frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water , whether or not water is present in the substrate ground ice is not always present , as may be the case with nonporous bedrock , but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential phreatic zone of the thawed substrate it is expected that the high number of structural failures is due to permafrost thawing , which is thought to be linked to climate change increasing temperatures allow deeper active layer depths , resulting in increased water infiltration ice within the soil melts , causing loss of soil strength , accelerated movement , and potential debris flows they extended the use of effective stress concept to partially frozen soils for use in slope stability analysis of warming permafrost slopes in the northern circumpolar region , permafrost contains 1700 & nbsp ; billion tons of organic material equaling almost half of all organic material in all soils the amount of carbon sequestered in permafrost is four times the carbon that has been released to the atmosphere due to human activities in modern time one manifestation of this is yedoma , which is an organic-rich ( about 2 % carbon by mass ) pleistocene-age loess permafrost with ice content of 50–90 % by volume formation of permafrost has significant consequences for ecological systems , primarily due to constraints imposed upon rooting zones , but also due to limitations on den and burrow geometries for fauna requiring subsurface homes one of the most widespread examples is the dominance of black spruce in extensive permafrost areas , since this species can tolerate rooting pattern constrained to the near surface if placed along each other , bacteria from one kilogram of active layer soil will form a 1000 & nbsp ; km long chain permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming , and thus , large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming scientists have determined three characteristics necessary for a virus to successfully preserve in ice : high abundance , ability to transport in ice , and ability to resume disease cycles upon being released from ice in 2012 , russian researchers proved that permafrost can serve as a natural repository for ancient life forms by reviving of silene stenophylla from 30,000 year old tissue found in an ice age squirrel burrow in the siberian permafrost among other issues addressed by the ipa are : problems for construction on permafrost owing to the change of soil properties of the ground on which structures are placed and the biological processes in permafrost , e.g warming can result in thawing of the soil and its consequent weakening of support for a structure as the ice content turns to water ; alternatively , where structures are built on piles , warming can cause movement through creep because of the change of friction on the piles even as the soil remains frozen the trans-alaska pipeline system uses heat pipe permafrost cooling to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the qingzang railway in tibet employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool , both in areas with frost-susceptible soil
