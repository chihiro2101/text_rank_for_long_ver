the plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper , and strong pressure applied pushing the paper into the marks , so that a transfer of the ink to the paper occurs the tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas , and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time a variety of early experiments aimed to add tonal effects to etching included the first use of a resin dust ground by the painter and printmaker jan van de velde iv in amsterdam , around 1650 it was taken up by the watercolourist paul sandby , who also seems to have introduced technical refinements as well as inventing the name '' aquatint '' in england artists such as sandby and thomas gainsborough were attracted by the suitability of etched outlines with aquatint for reproducing the popular english landscape watercolours , which at this period usually also had been given an initial outline drawing in ink publishers of prints and illustrations for expensive books , both important british markets at the time , also adopted the technique in all these areas , a print with etching and aquatint gave very satisfactory results when watercolour was added by relatively low-skilled painters copying a model , with a flat wash of colour on top of the varied tones of the aquatint griffiths , 94 after the french revolution , one of the most successful publishers in london , the german rudolf ackermann , had numbers of french refugees working on the floor above his shop in the strand in london , each brushing a single colour and then passing the sheet down a long table mayor , 374–376 over the same period in france there was sustained interest in techniques for true colour printing using multiple plates , which used multiple printmaking techniques which often included aquatint ( or mezzotint ) for tone griffiths , 119 another branch of this french movement mostly used mezzotint for tone and came to specialize in illustrating medical textbooks griffiths , 118–119 goya , maker of incontestably the greatest prints using aquatint , probably learned of the technique through giovanni david from genoa , the first significant italian to use it this means that , were the plate printed with no further biting , the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white ( no ink ) and black ( full ink ) a test piece may be made with etching times noted , as the strength of the etchant will vary etching for many hours ( up to 24 ) will be as dark as etching for one hour , but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper contemporary printmakers often use spraypaint instead of a powder , particularly when using the technique known as sugar-lift this mixture is then applied to a prepared plate with a brush , allowing for a bold expression not possible with the most etching techniques šimon , second hand booksellers , spring ( in paris ) , 1912 , colour soft ground etching and aquatint file : john taylor arms - on lake como , number two - google art project.jpg john taylor arms , on lake como , number two , 1919 , colour printed etching and aquatint file : sydney long - hawkesbury landscape.jpg sydney long , hawkesbury landscape , са david hockney , known for his many paintings of the los angeles lifestyle in the 1960s , has created a number of aquatints and etchings used with color in his '' the blue guitar '' series of prints
