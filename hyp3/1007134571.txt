general topology grew out of a number of areas , most importantly the following : the detailed study of subsets of the real line ( once known as the topology of point sets ; this usage is now obsolete ) the introduction of the manifold concept the study of metric spaces , especially normed linear spaces , in the early days of functional analysis a base ( or basis ) b for a topological space x with topology t is a collection of open sets in t such that every open set in t can be written as a union of elements of b every subset of a topological space can be given the subspace topology in which the open sets are the intersections of the open sets of the larger space with the subset for any indexed family of topological spaces , the product can be given the product topology , which is generated by the inverse images of open sets of the factors under the projection mappings a quotient space is defined as follows : if x is a topological space and y is a set , and if f : xâ†’ y is a surjection function , then the quotient topology on y is the collection of subsets of y that have open inverse images under f the map f is then the natural projection onto the set of equivalence classes if a set is given a different topology , it is viewed as a different topological space any set can be given the discrete space , in which every subset is open also , any set can be given the trivial topology ( also called the indiscrete topology ) , in which only the empty set and the whole space are open this example shows that in general topological spaces , limits of sequences need not be unique however , often topological spaces must be hausdorff spaces where limit points are unique any set can be given the cofinite topology in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite any set can be given the cocountable topology , in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its complement is countable there are many ways to define a topology on r , the set of real numbers there exist numerous topologies on any given finite set similarly , every simplex and every simplicial complex inherits a natural topology from r n many sets of linear operators in functional analysis are endowed with topologies that are defined by specifying when a particular sequence of functions converges to the zero function an extreme example : if a set is given the discrete topology , all functions : f\colon x \rightarrow t to any topological space are continuous on the other hand , if is equipped with the indiscrete topology and the space set is at least t0 space , then the only continuous functions are the constant functions several equivalent definitions for a topological structure exist and thus there are several equivalent ways to define a continuous function however , in general topological spaces , there is no notion of nearness or distance in several contexts , the topology of a space is conveniently specified in terms of limit points if x is a first-countable space and countable choice holds , then the converse also holds : any function preserving sequential limits is continuous ( the spaces for which the two properties are equivalent are called sequential spaces ) this motivates the consideration of nets instead of sequences in general topological spaces the function d is also called distance function or simply distance
