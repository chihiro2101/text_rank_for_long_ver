dov ber of mezeritch was known as the maggid — '' preacher '' or literally '' sayer , '' one who preaches and admonishes to go in god 's ways — of mezritsh ( the german form meseritz is sometimes used instead of mezeritch ) on hearing his mother weeping , he asked : '' mother , do we have to be so unhappy because we have lost a house ? '' she replied that she was mourning the family tree , which was destroyed , and is traced to king david by way of rabbi yochanan hasandlar and master in the talmud his wife complained and the maggid went outside to '' curse '' israel he went outside and said : '' o children of israel , may abundant blessings come upon you ! '' when his wife complained a second time , he went outside again and cried : '' let all happiness come to the children of israel — but they shall give their money to thorn bushes and stones ! '' the baby was too weak to cry , and the maggid sighed rather than '' cursing '' dov ber later became an admirer of isaac luria 's system of kabbalah , which was becoming popular at that time , and was aware of moshe chaim luzzatto , whose writings , then only in manuscript , were well known among the polish mystics of the period dov ber followed the lurian school , living the life of an ascetic , fasting a great deal , praying intensely , and living in poverty he arrived at the baal shem tov 's house , expecting to hear expositions of profound mysteries , but instead was told stories of the latter 's everyday life jewish philosopher solomon maimon records an encounter with the maggid in his memoirs , in which he passes a strong negative judgement on the hasidic movement after the meal he would reportedly begin to chant , and placing his hand upon his forehead , would ask those present to quote any verse from the bible the baal shem tov had travelled across jewish areas , reaching out to and inspiring the common folk , whose sincerity he cherished he sought to revive the broken spirit of the simple jews at the same time , he would also seek out the great scholars of talmud and kabbalah , to win them over to hasidism , to whom he taught the inner meaning of his teachings dov ber , in contrast , set up his court in mezhirichi , where his lameness restricted him , and devoted his main focus to articulating the mystical-philosophical system within the baal shem tov 's teachings to his close circle of disciples , who would lead the future movement the simple folk were also able to visit during the sabbath public attendancies of dov ber , and receive spiritual encouragement and comfort these disciples , being themselves great talmudic authorities and well-versed in kabbalah and hasidic philosophy , were successful in turning hasidus into a vast movement the local rabbis were annoyed by the growth of the movement , but could not easily do anything about it this , combined with the new dispersal of their locations , meant that after the maggid , the hasidic movement avoided appointing one unifying leader to succeed dovber in hasidic history , noam elimelech became the spiritual doctrine for general-hasidism , giving birth to the many leaders , successors and dynasties of mainstream hasidism , and inspiring the emotional attachment and spiritual bond of the common folk to their rebbe where the mainstream role of the tzaddik was emphasised , it often accompanied belief in the benefit of miracle-working , to channel spiritual and material blessing , and increase fervour later dynasties such as peshischa-kotzk would break away from this general-hasidic emphasis on tzaddikim and mysticism reputedly unable to receive a full teaching from the maggid , as his excitement caused him to have to run out of the room in dveikus , his holy example personified the elevated soul of the tzaddik he innovated a new spiritual path in defending the people , and persuading their '' heavenly father '' to nullify harsh decrees there is a great deal of overlapping between all these texts , but each contains teachings that do not appear in the others just as god in his goodness limited himself , and thus descended to the level of the world and man , so it is the duty of the latter to strive to unite with god rabbi dov ber 's view of prayer was that it is the purpose of the life on earth to advance until the perfect union with god is attained the way to achieve this , he argued , is through prayer , in which man forgets himself and his surroundings , and concentrates all his thought and feeling upon union with god like the neoplatonism , he said that when a man becomes so absorbed in the contemplation of an object that his whole power of thought is concentrated upon one point , his self becomes unified with that point so prayer in such a state of real ecstasy , effecting a union between god and man , is extremely important , and may even be able to overcome the laws of nature
