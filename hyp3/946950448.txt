although the knowledge of casting soft metals in moulds was well established before johannes gutenberg 's time , his discovery of an alloy that was hard , durable , and would take a clear impression from the mould ( because it did not shrink as much as lead alone when cooled ) represents a fundamental aspect of his solution to the problem of printing with movable type cheap , plentifully available as galena and easily workable , lead has many of the ideal characteristics , but on its own it lacks the necessary hardness and does not make castings with sharp details because molten lead shrinks and sags when it cools to a solid after much experimentation it was found that adding pewterer 's tin , obtained from cassiterite , improved the ability of the cast type to withstand the wear and tear of the printing process , making it tougher but not more brittle despite patiently trying different proportions of both metals , solving the second part of the type metal problem proved very difficult without the addition of yet a third metal , antimony type metal is an alloy of lead , tin and antimony in different proportions depending on the application , be it individual character mechanical casting for hand setting , mechanical line casting or individual character mechanical typesetting and stereo plate casting pure lead is a relatively cheap metal , is soft thus easy to work , and it is easy to cast since it melts at fry 's metal foundries , printing metals , great britain , revised edition 1966 when alloyed with lead to produce type metal , antimony gives it the hardness it needs to resist deformation during printing , and gives it sharper castings from the mould to produce clear , easily read printed text on the page type metal should produce a true and sharp cast , and reproduce the matrix in all detail type metal should be strong and lasting , to endure wear and pressure while printing type metal should be easy to cast , this means : a reasonable low melting point , iron should not dissolve in the molten metal , mould and nozzles should stay clean and easy to maintain the addition of a small amount of antimony ( 5 % to 6 % ) to lead will significantly alter the alloy 's behavior compared to pure lead : although the melting point of pure antimony is 630 & nbsp ; °c , this mixture will be completely molten and a homogeneous fluid even at temperatures as low as 371 & nbsp ; °c letting this mixture cool the alloy will remain liquid even through 355 & nbsp ; °c , the melting point of pure lead once the temperature reaches 291 & nbsp ; °c , lead crystals will start to form , increasing the cohesion of the liquid alloy using a 12 % antimony , 88 % lead mixture prevents crystal formation entirely , becoming a eutectic alloys used on monotype machines tend to contain higher contents of tin , to obtain tougher character present usage of type metal repeated assays were done at regular intervals to monitor the alloy used , since every time the metal is recycled , roughly half a per cent of tin content is lost through oxidation brass spaces contain zinc , which is extremely counterproductive in type metal even a tiny amount — & nbsp ; less than 1 % & nbsp ; — will form a dusty surface on the molten metal surface that is difficult to remove characters cast from contaminated type metal such as this are of inferior quality , the solution being to discard and replace with fresh alloy the same applies to aluminium , although this metal will float on top of the melt , and will be easily discovered and removed , before it is dissolved into the lead iron is hardly dissolved into type metal , although the molten metal is always in contact with the cast iron surface of the melting pot
