the amount of sewage sludge produced is proportional to the amount and concentration of wastewater treated , and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used the total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks ( if they are part of the process configuration ) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step of the biological treatment processes , the activated sludge process produces about 70–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml of waste activated sludge , and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process : 60–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries bacteria in class a sludge products can actually regrow under certain environmental conditions pathogens are not a significant health issue if sewage sludge is properly treated and site-specific management practices are followed in 2009 the epa released the targeted national sewage sludge study , which reports on the level of metals , chemicals , hormones , and other materials present in a statistical sample of sewage sludges contaminants of concern in sewage sludge are plasticizers , pdbes , and others generated by human activities , including personal care products and medicines sewage sludge is produced from the wastewater treatment in sewage treatment plants and consists of two basic forms — raw primary sludge and secondary sludge , also known as activated sludge in the case of the activated sludge process comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries , waste management , vol kelessidis and stasinakis , 2012 following treatment , sewage sludge is either landfilled , dumped in the ocean , incinerated , applied on agricultural land or , in some cases , retailed or given away for free to the general public according to a review article published in 2012 , sludge reuse ( including direct agricultural application and composting ) was the predominant choice for sludge management in eu-15 ( 53 % of produced sludge ) , following by incineration ( 21 % of produced sludge ) . classes of sewage sludge after treatment ( united states ) in the united states , the following classes of sewage sludge after treatment are defined : class a sludge is typically dried and pasteurized , and is also known as '' exceptional '' quality after treatment , and dependent upon the quality of sludge produced ( for example with regards to heavy metal content ) , sewage sludge is most commonly either disposed of in landfills , dumped in the ocean or applied to land for its fertilizing properties , as pioneered by the product milorganite it used to be common practice to dump sewage sludge into the ocean , however , this practice has stopped in many nations due to environmental concerns as well to domestic and international laws and treaties biosolids is a term widely used to denote the byproduct of domestic and commercial sewage treatment that is to be used in agriculture national regulations that dictate the practice of land application of treated sewage sludge differ widely and e.g the findings of a 20-year field study of air , land , and water in arizona , concluded that use of biosolids is sustainable and improves the soil and crops studies have indicated that pharmaceuticals and personal care products , which often adsorb to sludge during wastewater treatment , can persist in agricultural soils following biosolid application the impact of this persistence in soils is unknown , but the link to human and land animal health is likely tied to the capacity for plants to absorb and accumulate these chemicals in their consumed tissues treated sewage sludge has been used in the uk , europe and china agriculturally for more than 80 years , though there is increasing pressure in some countries to stop the practice of land application due to farm land contamination and public outrage this has been very successful and , for example , the content of cadmium in sewage sludge in major european cities is now only 1 % of what it was in 1970 in addition , the ash produced by incineration or incomplete combustion processes ( such as fluidized-bed dryers ) may be difficult to use without subsequent treatment due to high heavy metal content ; solutions to this include leaching of the ashes to remove heavy metals or in the case of ash produced in a complete-combustion process , or with biochar produced from a pyrolytic process , the heavy metals may be fixed in place and the ash material readily usable as a leeds preferred additive to concrete or asphalt residents living near class b sludge processing sites may experience asthma or pulmonary distress due to bioaerosols released from sludge fields a sample of 437 people exposed to class b sludge ( living within of sludged land ) - and using a control group of 176 people not exposed to sludge ( not living within of sludged land ) reported the following : although cum hoc ergo propter hoc , such extensive correlations may lead reasonable people to conclude that precaution is necessary in dealing with sludge and sludged farmlands '' they further suggest that even class a treated sludge may have chemical contaminants ( including heavy metals , such as lead ) or endotoxins present , and a precautionary approach may be justified on this basis , though the vast majority of incidents reported by lewis , et al a 2005 report by the state of north carolina concluded that '' a surveillance program of humans living near application sites should be developed to determine if there are adverse health effects in humans and animals as a result of biosolids application european legislation on dangerous substances has eliminated the production and marketing of some substances that have been of historic concern such as persistent organic micro-pollutants the european commission has said repeatedly that the '' directive on the protection of the environment , and in particular of the soil , when sewage sludge is used in agriculture '' ( 86/278/eec ) has been very successful in that there have been no cases of adverse effect where it has been applied in austria , in order to dispose of the sewage sludge in a landfill , it must first be treated in a way that reduces its biological reactivity biosolids that meet the class b pathogen treatment and pollutant criteria , in accordance with the epa '' standards for the use or disposal of sewage sludge '' ( 40 cfr part 503 ) , can be land applied with formal site restrictions and strict record keeping biosolids that meet class a pathogen reduction requirements or equivalent treatment by a '' process to further reduce pathogens '' ( pfrp ) have the least restrictions on use since 1884 when sewage was first treated the amount of sludge has increased along with population and more advanced treatment technology ( secondary treatment in addition to primary treatment ) the wider question is whether or not changes on the sea floor caused by the portion of sludge that settles are severe enough to justify the added operational cost and human health concerns of applying sludge to land
