since the 1730s , when the first act of parliament to authorize a canal from the river severn to stroud had been passed , the stroudwater navigation had been seen as part of a larger plan to link london and bristol by waterway no work took place immediately , but the stroudwater was eventually opened in 1779 , and within two years the shareholders commissioned a survey for a canal from dudbridge to cricklade , which would complete the link commissioners from the river thames thought that it would have to be built for narrow boats , since the cost of a larger tunnel would be prohibitive however , a decision was made that it would be built as a broad tunnel , wide and high , and so the company advertised for tunnellers the tunnel was constructed from many workfaces , with 25 shafts sunk along its course to provide access the summit level and a branch to cirencester were completed in 1787 , and became operational as soon as the tunnel opened the canal 's summit , which is above sea level and long , includes the sapperton tunnel , at the time , the longest in england an extra , shallow lock was built at boxwell , which allowed the level of the canal to be dropped beyond it , and more water to be taken from boxwell springs in a further attempt to prevent water loss , at king 's reach , the section immediately east of sapperton tunnel , the canal was lined with concrete rather than puddle clay in the west , the situation was remedied in 1820 , with the construction of the gloucester and sharpness canal seven years later some improvements were made to the river after 1786 , but the canal company encouraged the building of bypasses the line opened to kemble in 1841 , and the tolls on the carriage of materials for the railway 's construction improved the financial position of the canal for a short time in 1893 , the thames and severn company announced that the canal between chalford and inglesham would close two days later negotiations with a number of interested parties took place , and having given an assurance that it would not be converted into a railway to the great western railway , an act of parliament was obtained in 1895 , which formed a trust with powers to raise £15,000 although the canal was re-opened in march 1899 , lack of water on the summit level soon closed it again , after which gloucestershire county council suggested that they take it over extensive lobbying in 1979 resulted in gloucestershire county council deciding to rebuild a damaged bridge at daneway , rather than replace it with a much cheaper low-level causeway , which would have severed the route despite initially saying that a culvert would not be built , negotiation continued , and – helped by grants of £250,000 from gloucestershire county council and £125,000 from north wilts council – the department of the environment decided in 1997 that a culvert would be provided under the road in 2002 , the waterway was identified as being of high priority in the association of inland navigation authorities report entitled vision for strategic enhancement of britain 's inland navigation network , and was one of several new projects highlighted at british waterways ' unlocked and unlimited conference held in march alongside these major developments , the trust has rebuilt a number of locks and bridges and some small sections of the rest of the route are now in water the role of project leader was taken over by stroud district council , and a new body , the stroud valleys canal company , was created in march 2009 to act as a holding company for the assets of the waterway , with a responsibility to manage and maintain it once it is reopened the final section of the canal before it joins the stroudwater navigation presents particular problems for restoration , as the channel had been used as part of a flood relief scheme by the environment agency as the project neared completion , open days to allow the public to walk along the bottom of the new canal section were held on 10 and 11 may 2013 , and were attended by over 1,800 people thus the heritage lottery funded works ended at bowbridge lock , and work up to hope mill lock has been undertaken largely by volunteers volunteers completed restoration of griffin 's mill lock in 2017 , but dredging of the intervening channel took rather longer , and the lock was opened on 9 july 2018 work had already begun on the restoration of ham mill lock , the next one upstream in a separate development , water supply to the restored section was improved by building a siphon at geogh 's orchard lock , which takes water from a millpond supplied by the river frome and feeds it into the lock the simpler work includes construction of two new locks , restoration of a further six locks , construction of several minor road bridges , and reinstatement of about of in-filled canal the section does not pose the major engineering challenges faced elsewhere , but land ownership is an issue , and there are several miles of infilled canal around kempsford funding is only in place for minor projects , but several locks have been substantially restored , lengths of towpath reconstructed , and dredging completed in 2002 british waterways bought the lock at inglesham and the adjacent round house , to safeguard the route of the canal restoring this central section poses several major engineering difficulties : firstly to overcome the water supply that was always inadequate , and secondly because the sapperton tunnel is blocked by two rock falls as of may 2015 , there was no significant funding in place for any restoration projects on this section of the canal canals of great britain history of the british canal system list of canal tunnels in the united kingdom the
