one purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to use deliberation among a group of lay citizens to distill a more authentic public opinion about societal issues but not directly create binding law ; devices such as the deliberative opinion poll have been designed to achieve this goal another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to serve as a form of direct democracy , where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a '' public will '' and directly creates binding law according to fishkin , this process attempts to indirectly filter the mass public opinion because representatives are better equipped with the knowledge of the common good than ordinary citizens james fishkin , who has designed practical implementations of deliberative democracy for over 15 years in various countries , describes five characteristics essential for legitimate deliberation : : information : the extent to which participants are given access to reasonably accurate information that they believe to be relevant to the issue : substantive balance : the extent to which arguments offered by one side or from one perspective are answered by considerations offered by those who hold other perspectives : diversity : the extent to which the major position in the public are represented by participants in the discussion : conscientiousness : the extent to which participants sincerely weigh the merits of the arguments : equal consideration : the extent to which arguments offered by all participants are considered on the merits regardless of which participants offer them in fishkin 's definition of deliberative democracy , lay citizens must participate in the decision-making process , thus making it a subtype of direct democracy joshua cohen , a student of john rawls , outlined conditions that he thinks constitute the root principles of the theory of deliberative democracy , in the article '' deliberation and democratic legitimacy '' in the 1989 book the good polity cohen presents deliberative democracy as more than a theory of legitimacy , and forms a body of substantive rights around it based on achieving '' ideal deliberation '' : it is free in two ways : the participants consider themselves bound solely by the results and preconditions of the deliberation in democracy and liberty , an essay published in 1998 , cohen reiterated many of these points , also emphasizing the concept of '' reasonable pluralism '' – the acceptance of different , incompatible worldviews and the importance of good faith deliberative efforts to ensure that as far as possible the holders of these views can live together on terms acceptable to all they define it as '' a form of government in which free and equal citizens and their representatives justify decisions in a process in which they give one another reasons that are mutually acceptable and generally accessible , with the aim of reaching decisions that are binding on all at present but open to challenge in the future '' they state that deliberative democracy has four requirements , which refer to the kind of reasons that citizens and their representatives are expected to give to one another : reciprocal a claimed strength of deliberative democratic models is that they are more easily able to incorporate science opinion and base policy on outputs of ongoing research , because : time is given for all participants to understand and discuss the science scientific peer review , adversarial presentation of competing arguments , refereed journals , even betting markets , are also deliberative processes studies by james fishkin and others have found that deliberative democracy tends to produce outcomes which are superior to those in other forms of democracy deliberative democracy produces less partisanship and more sympathy with opposing views ; more respect for evidence-based reasoning rather than opinion ; a greater commitment to the decisions taken by those involved ; and a greater chance for widely shared consensus to emerge , thus promoting social cohesion between people from different backgrounds fishkin cites extensive empirical support for the increase in public spiritedness that is often caused by participation in deliberation , and says theoretical support can be traced back to foundational democratic thinkers such as john stuart mill and alexis de tocqueville the specific mill work cited is considerations on representative government ( 1861 ) , and the specific tocqueville work cited is democracy in america ( 1835 ) former diplomat carne ross writes that in 2011 that the debates arising from deliberative democracy are also much more civil , collaborative , and evidence-based than the debates in traditional town hall meetings or in internet forums for ross , the key reason for this is that in deliberative democracy citizens are empowered by knowledge that their debates will have a measurable impact on society james fishkin 's 1991 work , '' democracy and deliberation '' , introduced a way to apply the theory of deliberative democracy to real-world decision making , by way of what he calls the deliberative opinion poll the political philosopher charles blattberg has criticized deliberative democracy on four grounds : ( i ) the rules for deliberation that deliberative theorists affirm interfere with , rather than facilitate , good practical reasoning ; ( ii ) deliberative democracy is ideologically biased in favor of liberalism as well as republican over parliamentary democratic systems ; ( iii ) deliberative democrats assert a too-sharp division between just and rational deliberation on the one hand and self-interested and coercive bargaining or negotiation on the other ; and ( iv ) deliberative democrats encourage an adversarial relationship between state and society , one that undermines solidarity between citizens consensus-based decision making similar to deliberative democracy is characteristic of the hunter gather band society thought to predominate in pre-historical times athenian democracy was both deliberative and largely direct : some decisions were made by representatives but most were made by ″the people″ directly when democracy was revived as a political system about 2000 years later , decisions were made by representatives rather than directly by the people although some of the seminal work was done in the 1970s and 80s , it was only in 1990 that deliberative democracy began to attract substantial attention from political scientists according to professor john dryzek , early work on deliberative democracy was part of efforts to develop a theory of democratic legitimacy the more common view , held by contributors such as james fishkin , is that direct deliberative democracy can be complementary to traditional representative democracy examples include national issues forums , choices for the 21st century , study circles , deliberative opinion polls , the citizens ' assembly usa , and the 21st-century town meetings convened by americaspeaks , among others for example , with europolis 2009 , at the time one of the largest deliberative assemblies ever held , which set out to assess the public 's view on a wide range of issues and included representatives from all 27 eu member nations , the share of citizens intending to vote for the greens increased from 8 % to 18 % according to professor stephen tierney , perhaps the earliest notable example of academic interest in the deliberative aspects of democracy occurred in john rawls 1971 work a theory of justice bessette coined the term '' deliberative democracy '' in his 1980 work '' deliberative democracy : the majority principle in republican government '' , and went on to elaborate and defend the notion in '' the mild voice of reason '' ( 1994 ) although political theorists took the lead in the study of deliberative democracy , political scientists have in recent years begun to investigate its processes one of the main challenges currently is to discover more about the actual conditions under which the ideals of deliberative democracy are more or less likely to be realized '' can direct democracy be made deliberative ?
