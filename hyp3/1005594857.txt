the vlt 's 8.2-meter telescopes were originally designed to operate in three modes : as a set of four independent telescopes ( this is the primary mode of operation ) this mode is used for observations of relatively bright sources with small angular extent multiple telescopes are sometimes independently pointed at the same object , either to increase the total light-gathering power or to provide simultaneous observations with complementary instruments in its interferometric operating mode , the light from the telescopes is reflected off mirrors and directed through tunnels to a central beam combining laboratory unlike many earlier optical and infrared interferometers , the astronomical multi-beam recombiner ( amber ) instrument on vlti was initially designed to perform coherent integration ( which requires signal-to-noise greater than one in each atmospheric coherence time ) using the big telescopes and coherent integration , the faintest object the vlti can observe is magnitude 7 in the near infrared for broadband observations , similar to many other near infrared / optical interferometers without fringe tracking although the use of large telescope diameters and adaptive optics correction can improve the sensitivity , this can not extend the reach of optical interferometry beyond nearby stars and the brightest active galactic nuclei because the unit telescopes are used most of the time independently , they are used in the interferometric mode mostly during bright time ( that is , close to full moon ) the first two instruments at the vlti were vinci ( a test instrument used to set up the system , now decommissioned ) and midi , which only allow two telescopes to be used at any one time with the installation of the three-telescope amber closure-phase instrument in 2005 , the first imaging observations from the vlti are expected soon deployment of the phase referenced imaging and microarcsecond astrometry ( prima ) instrument started 2008 with the aim to allow phase-referenced measurements in either an astrometric two-beam mode or as a fringe-tracker successor to vinci , operated concurrent with one of the other instruments in march 2011 , the pionier instrument for the first time simultaneously combined the light of the four unit telescopes , potentially making vlti the biggest optical telescope in the world
