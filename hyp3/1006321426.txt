in contexts such as historical writing , it is almost always advisable to use primary sources and that '' if none are available , it is only with great caution that the author may proceed to make use of secondary sources though the terms primary source and secondary source originated in historiography as a way to trace the history of historical ideas , they have been applied to many other fields for example , these ideas may be used to trace the history of scientific theories , literary elements , and other information that is passed from one author to another in the history of ideas or intellectual history , the main primary sources are books , essays , and letters written by intellectuals ; these intellectuals may include historians , whose books and essays are therefore considered primary sources for the intellectual historian , though they are secondary sources in their own topical fields in the humanities , a primary source could be defined as something that was created either during the time period being studied or afterward by individuals reflecting on their involvement in the events of that time in the natural sciences , a primary source could be defined as a report of original findings or ideas these sources often appear in the form of research articles with sections on methods and results most primary source materials are not digitized and may only be represented online with a record or finding aid ideally , a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources historians studying the modern period with the intention of publishing an academic article prefer to go back to available primary sources and to seek new ( in other words , forgotten or lost ) ones primary sources , whether accurate or not , offer new input into historical questions and most modern history revolves around heavy use of archives and special collections for the purpose of finding useful primary sources a work on history is not likely to be taken seriously as a scholarship if it only cites secondary sources , as it does not indicate that original research has been done in many fields and contexts , such as historical writing , it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible , and '' if none are available , it is only with great caution that the author may proceed to make use of secondary sources '' in addition , primary sources avoid the problem inherent in secondary sources in which each new author may distort and put a new spin on the findings of prior cited authors the errors may be corrected in secondary sources , which are often subjected to peer review , can be well documented , and are often written by historians working in institutions where methodological accuracy is important to the future of the author 's career and reputation many sources can be considered either primary or secondary , depending on the context in which they are examined if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion , it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion for example , if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter , that document may be considered '' primary '' , since it is the closest known thing to an original source ; but if the letter is later found , it may then be considered '' secondary '' in some instances , the reason for identifying a text as the '' primary source '' may devolve from the fact that no copy of the original source material exists , or that it is the oldest extant source for the information cited
