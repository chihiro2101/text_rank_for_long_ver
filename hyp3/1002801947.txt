this type of structure is still in use in many lightweight aircraft using welded steel tube trusses simple box structures may be rounded by the addition of supported lightweight stringers , allowing the fabric covering to form a more aerodynamic shape , or one more pleasing to the eye a fabric covering over the structure completed the aerodynamic shell ( see the vickers wellington for an example of a large warplane which uses this process ) a simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core , with a fiberglass covering , eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds , but requiring more effort in finishing ( see the rutan varieze ) no plywood-skin fuselage is truly monocoque , since stiffening elements are incorporated into the structure to carry concentrated loads that would otherwise buckle the thin skin most modern large aircraft are built using this technique , but use several large sections constructed in this fashion which are then joined with fasteners to form the complete fuselage most metal light aircraft are constructed using this process some modern aircraft are constructed with composite materials for major control surfaces , wings , or the entire fuselage such as the boeing 787 cabin windows , made from much lighter than glass stretched acrylic glass , consists of multiple panes : an outer one built to support four times the maximum cabin pressure , an inner one for redundancy and a scratch pane near the passenger conversely , there have been a small number of aircraft designs which have no separate wing , but use the fuselage to generate lift one of the earliest aircraft using this design approach is burnelli cby-3 , which fuselage was airfoil shaped to produce lift
