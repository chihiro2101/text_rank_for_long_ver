'' littlewood returned to britain in 1900 to attend st paul 's school in london , studying under francis sowerby macaulay , an influential algebraic geometry in 1906 , after completing the second part of the tripos , he started his research under ernest barnes : '' he began his research later that year on asymptotic formulas for integral functions of order zero , under his tutor and director of studies e he began research under the supervision of ernest william barnes , who suggested that he attempt to prove the riemann hypothesis : littlewood showed that if the riemann hypothesis is true then the prime number theorem follows and obtained the error term however , the link between the riemann hypothesis and the prime number theorem had been known before in continental europe , and littlewood wrote later in his book , a mathematician 's miscellany that his rediscovery of the result did not shed a positive light on the isolated nature of british mathematics at the time in his other work , he collaborated with raymond paley on littlewood–paley theory in fourier theory , and with cyril offord in combinatorial work on random sums , in developments that opened up fields that are still intensively studied he also , with hardy , identified the work of the indian mathematician srinivasa ramanujan as that of a genius , and supported him in travelling to the uk and working at cambridge in a 1947 lecture , the danish mathematician harald bohr said , '' to illustrate to what extent hardy and littlewood in the course of the years came to be considered as the leaders of recent english mathematical research , i may report what an excellent colleague once jokingly said : 'nowadays , there are only three really great english mathematicians : hardy , littlewood , and hardy–littlewood ' '' there is a story ( related in the miscellany ) that at a conference littlewood met a german mathematician who said he was most interested to discover that littlewood really existed , as he had always assumed that littlewood was a name used by hardy for lesser work which he did not want to put out under his own name ; littlewood apparently roared with laughter
