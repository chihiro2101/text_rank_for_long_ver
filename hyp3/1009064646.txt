the miasma theory was the predominant theory of disease transmission before the germ theory took hold towards the end of the 19th century , and it is no longer accepted as a scientific theory of disease such infections , according to the theory , were not passed between individuals but would affect those within a locale that gave rise to such vapors 400 bc ) was the first person to write , in

not be seen by the eyes , which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases ad 175 ) , galen speculated that plagues were spread by '' certain seeds of plague '' , which were present in the air in the sushruta samhita , the ancient indian physician sushruta theorized : '' leprosy , fever , consumption , diseases of the eye , and other infectious diseases spread from one person to another by sexual union , physical contact , eating together , sleeping together , sitting together , and the use of same clothes , garlands and pastes he mentioned that people can transmit disease to others by breath , noted contagion with tuberculosis , and discussed the transmission of disease through water and dirt 21 the italian scholar and physician girolamo fracastoro proposed in 1546 in his book de contagione et contagiosis morbis that epidemic diseases are caused by transferable seed-like entities ( seminaria morbi ) that transmit infection by direct or indirect contact , or even without contact over long distances the diseases were categorised based on how they were transmitted , and how long they could lie dormant his studies with the microscope led him to the belief , which he was possibly the first to hold , that disease and putrefaction ( decay ) were caused by the presence of invisible living bodies in 1646 , kircher ( or '' kirchner '' , as it is often spelled ) , wrote that '' a number of things might be discovered in the blood of fever patients '' he noted the presence of '' little worms '' or '' animalcules '' in the blood and concluded that the disease was caused by microorganisms kircher 's conclusion that disease was caused by microorganisms was correct , although it is likely that what he saw under the microscope were in fact red or white blood cells and not the plague agent itself it was kircher who first proposed that living beings enter and exist in the blood melvin santer , '' richard bradley :

number 4 , autumn , 2009 , pp the italian agostino bassi was the first person to prove that a disease was caused by a microorganism when he conducted a series of experiments between 1808 and 1813 , demonstrating that a '' vegetable parasite '' caused a disease in silkworms known as calcinaccio which was devastating the french silk industry at the time even though the germ theory of disease pioneered by girolamo fracastoro had not yet achieved full development or widespread currency , snow demonstrated a clear understanding of germ theory in his writings he first published his theory in an 1849 essay on the mode of communication of cholera , in which he correctly suggested that the fecal-oral route was the mode of communication , and that the disease replicated itself in the lower intestines he even proposed in his 1855 edition of the work , that the structure of cholera was that of a cell snow 's 1849 recommendation that water be '' filtered and boiled before it is used '' is one of the first practical applications of germ theory in the area of public health and is the antecedent to the modern boil-water advisory this action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak , but snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline pasteur saved france 's silk industry by developing a method to screen silkworms eggs for those that were not infected , a method that is still used today to control this and other silkworm diseases robert koch is known for developing four basic criteria ( known as koch 's postulates ) for demonstrating , in a scientifically sound manner , that a disease is caused by a particular organism koch 's postulates were developed in the 19th century as general guidelines to identify pathogens that could be isolated with the techniques of the day even in koch 's time , it was recognized that some infectious agents were clearly responsible for disease even though they did not fulfill all of the postulates attempts to rigidly apply koch 's postulates to the diagnosis of viral diseases in the late 19th century , at a time when viruses could not be seen or isolated in culture , may have impeded the early development of the field of virology currently , a number of infectious agents are accepted as the cause of disease despite their not fulfilling all of koch 's postulates the second postulate may also be suspended for certain microorganisms or entities that can not ( at the present time ) be grown in pure culture , such as prions responsible for creutzfeldt–jakob disease
