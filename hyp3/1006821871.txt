if all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape , the flower is said to be regular or actinomorphic ( meaning '' ray-formed '' ) in irregular flowers , other floral parts may be modified from the regular form , but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry it appears that the mechanisms to form petals evolved very few times ( perhaps only once ) , rather than evolving repeatedly from stamens this develops competition between flowers and as a result flowers must provide incentives to appeal to pollinators ( unless the flower self-pollinates or is involved in wind pollination ) petals have various functions and purposes depending on the type of plant in general , petals operate to protect some parts of the flower and attract/repel specific pollinators various color traits are used by different petals that could attract pollinators that have poor smelling abilities , or that only come out at certain parts of the day some flowers can change the color of their petals as a signal to mutual pollinators to approach or keep away for example , large petals and flowers will attract pollinators at a large distance or that are large themselves collectively the scent , color , and shape of petals all play a role in attracting/repelling specific pollinators and providing suitable conditions for pollinating insects such as the bee or butterfly can see the ultraviolet marks which are contained on these flowers , acting as an attractive mechanism which is not visible towards the human eye many flowers contain a variety of shapes acting to aid with the landing of the visiting insect and also influence the insect to brush against anthers and stigmas ( parts of the flower ) another attractive mechanism for flowers is the use of scents which are highly attractive to humans flowers are also pollinated by birds and must be large and colorful to be visible against natural scenery the dactylanthus has only its flowers pointing to the surface and the flowers lack color but have the advantage of containing much nectar and a strong scent
