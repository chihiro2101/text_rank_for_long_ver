that group disbanded by 1974 , but scholz subsequently worked with masdea and delp to produce six new demos , including '' more than a feeling '' , '' peace of mind '' , '' rock and roll band '' , '' something about you '' ( then entitled '' life is n't easy '' ) , '' hitch a ride '' ( then entitled '' san francisco day '' ) , and '' do n't be afraid '' according to scholz , the managers insisted that masdea had to be replaced before the band could get a recording deal the showcase was a success and the band agreed to put out ten albums over the next six years however , scholz wanted to record them in his basement studio so that he could work at his own pace scholz and producer john boylan hatched a plan to send the rest of the band to los angeles to make the record label happy , while scholz recorded most of boston 's debut album at home , with masdea playing drums on the track '' rock and roll band '' and scholz playing the other instruments this helped establish boston as one of rock 's top acts within a short time , being nominated for a grammy award as a '' best new artist '' the album spawned three singles , '' more than a feeling '' , '' long time '' , and '' peace of mind '' , all of which made the national charts despite having problems with manager paul ahern , being caught in the middle of a fight between ahern and his business partner charles mckenzie , and doing most of the recording work alone , scholz completed the second boston album two years after the debut album 's release the second album , do n't look back , was released by epic in august 1978 at the time this was considered a long gap between albums , but scholz still considered do n't look back to be a rush job and was unhappy with the album 's second side in particular another tour followed , and the album 's title track became a top-5 hit delayed by technical renovations to his studio , scholz eventually began the process of working on boston 's third album , determined to complete the album at his own pace and up to his demanding standard goudreau then decided to record a solo album that featured boston members delp and hashian , and which was recorded with the help of paul grupp , an engineer and producer familiar with scholz 's studio techniques there was tension when cbs 's marketing connected goudreau 's solo album to boston 's signature guitar sound , despite scholz not having played at all on this album despite the adversity , progress continued to be made on the third boston album the song became the lead single when third stage was finally released on september 23 , 1986 boston opened with '' rock and roll band '' and brought back the original drummer , jim masdea , to play drums for this one song by spring 1990 , scholz was back in the studio working on the band 's fourth studio album before he left , delp co-wrote with scholz and david sikes the song '' walk on '' , which eventually became the title track of the new album for the second album in a row , and for the second time in a decade , scholz 's work was delayed by renovations to his studio unlike boston 's previous albums , it failed to chart in the top 5 it produced one hit single , '' i need your love '' , which was widely played on some rock radio stations their first appearance was for two benefit shows at the house of blues on december 12–13 , 1994 , in cambridge the album featured all of the band 's hit singles except '' we 're ready '' , '' can'tcha say ( you believe in me ) /still in love '' , and '' i need your love '' along with three new songs , '' higher power '' , '' tell me '' , and an instrumental version of the '' star spangled banner '' smith and sikes left the band in late 1997 and recorded an album together scholz headed back to the studio in 1998 to begin work on a fifth album , which eventually turned out to be corporate america the title track of '' corporate america '' was uploaded by tom scholz to mp3.com under the pseudonym of '' downer 's revenge '' in early 2002 in order to test the album 's appeal to a younger demographic in 2006 , the first two boston albums appeared in remastered form the singers for boston included michael sweet of stryper , former band member curly smith , band member kimberley dahme , and a boston fan from north carolina named tommy decarlo , who was chosen to sing based on his performances of boston cover songs on his myspace page scholz made a point of saying that he , and not goudreau or sheehan , actually played all the guitars on '' more than a feeling '' as well as most of boston ’ s songs in the spring of 2008 , scholz and sweet introduced a new boston lineup , which subsequently did a north american summer tour , playing 53 dates in 12 weeks ( on a double bill with styx ) michael sweet left the band in august 2011 in order to focus on stryper scholz and pihl led the band on a 2012 north american tour , beginning on june 28 , 2012 , at the seminole hard rock live arena in hollywood , florida and ending on september 8 at the u.s work on the album started in 2002 cohen had previously recorded with the group on both corporate america and life , love & hope as a vocalist and flautist initially , the lineup was to include former spock 's beard drummer and vocalist nick d'virgilio for its first month of shows , with neal then returning , but d'virgilio proved '' not the right fit '' and smith rejoined in his place in april 2017 , scholz reported that he has been writing new material for the seventh boston album boston founder , guitarist , and primary songwriter tom scholz 's blend of musical styles , ranging from classical to 1960s english pop , has resulted in a unique sound , most consistently realized on the first two albums ( boston and do n't look back ) tom scholz also credited the late brad delp with helping to create boston 's sound with his signature vocal style
