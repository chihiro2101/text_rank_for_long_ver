in addition to statistical analysis , data management ( case selection , file reshaping , creating derived data ) and data documentation ( a metadata dictionary is stored in the datafile ) are features of the base software the many features of spss statistics are accessible via pull-down menus or can be programmed with a proprietary 4gl command syntax language the pull-down menu interface also generates command syntax : this can be displayed in the output , although the default settings have to be changed to make the syntax visible to the user a python programmability extension can access the information in the data dictionary and data and dynamically build command syntax programs the python programmability extension , introduced in spss 14 , replaced the less functional sax basic '' scripts '' for most purposes , although saxbasic remains available ) spss statistics places constraints on internal file structure , data types , data processing , and matching files , which together considerably simplify programming larger datasets such as statistical surveys are more often created in data entry software , or entered during computer-assisted personal interviewing , by scanning and using optical character recognition and optical mark recognition software , or by direct capture from online questionnaires v25 also includes new bayesian statistics capabilities , a method of statistical inference and publication ready charts , such as powerful new charting capabilities , including new default templates and the ability to share with microsoft office applications the software was released in its first version in 1968 as the statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ) after being developed by norman h early versions of spss statistics were written in fortran and designed for batch processing on mainframes , including for example ibm and icl versions , originally using punched cards for data and program input a processing run read a command file of spss commands and either a raw input file of fixed format data with a single record type , or a 'getfile ' of data saved by a previous run from version 10 ( spss-x ) in 1983 , data files could contain multiple record types companion software in the '' ibm spss '' family are used for data mining and text mining ( spss modeler ) , and realtime credit score ( ibm spss collaboration and deployment services ) although the '' c '' was for conversational , it also represented a distinction regarding how the data was stored : it used a column-oriented rather than a row-oriented ( internal ) database spss community ? ref wikipedia & nbsp ; â€“ support for developers of applications using spss products , including materials and examples of the python and r programmability features biomedical statistics - an educational website dedicated to statistical evaluation of biomedical data using spss software
