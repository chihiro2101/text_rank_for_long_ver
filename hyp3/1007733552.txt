the insurrection did not start with revolutionary goals ; it aimed to protect the ancient liberties from royal encroachments and to defend the established rights of the parlements – courts of appeal rather than legislative bodies like the english parliaments – and especially the right of the parlement of paris to limit the king 's power by refusing to register decrees that ran against custom the movement soon degenerated into factions , some of which attempted to overthrow mazarin and to reverse the policies of his predecessor cardinal richelieu ( in office 1624–1642 ) who had taken power for the crown from great territorial nobles , some of whom became leaders of the fronde when louis xiv became king in 1643 , he was only a child , and though richelieu had died the year before , his policies continued to dominate french life under his successor cardinal mazarin in august 1648 , feeling strengthened by the news of the louis ii de bourbon , prince de condé 's battle of lens ( 20 august 1648 ) , mazarin suddenly arrested the leaders of the parlement , whereupon paris broke into insurrection and barricaded the streets the royal faction , having no army at its immediate disposal , had to release the prisoners and promise reforms – on the night of 22 october it fled from paris the parisians , though still and always anti-cardinalist , had refused to ask for spanish aid , as proposed by their princely and noble adherents under armand de bourbon , prince de conti , and having no prospect of military success without such aid , the noble party submitted to the government and received concessions but peasants of the countryside rose against the invaders ; the royal army in champagne was in the capable hands of caesar , duc de choiseul , who counted 52 years of age and 36 of war experience ; and the little fortress of guise successfully resisted the archduke 's attack at that point mazarin drew upon plessis-praslin 's army for reinforcements to be sent to subdue the rebellion in the south forcing the royal general to retire the battle ( 15 december 1650 ) was severe and for a time doubtful , but turenne 's frondeurs gave way in the end , and his army , as an army , ceased to exist turenne himself , undeceived as to the part he was playing in the drama , asked and received the young king 's pardon , and meantime the court , with the and other loyal troops , had subdued the minor risings without difficulty ( march–april 1651 ) the war began again , and this time turenne and condé were pitted against one another after this campaign the civil war ceased , but in the several other campaigns of the franco-spanish war that followed , the two great soldiers were opposed to one another , turenne as the defender of france , condé as a spanish invader his bold leadership made itself felt in the bléneau ( 7 april 1652 ) , in which a portion of the royal army was destroyed ; but fresh troops came up to oppose him the royalists attacked all along the line and won a signal victory in spite of the knightly prowess of the prince and his great lords , but at the critical moment gaston 's daughter persuaded the parisians to open the gates and to admit condé 's army mazarin , feeling that public opinion was solidly against him , left france again , and the bourgeois of paris , quarreling with the princes , permitted the king to enter the city on 21 october 1652 the whole country , wearied of anarchy and disgusted with the princes , came to look to the king 's party as the party of order and settled government , and thus the fronde prepared the way for the absolutism of louis xiv the general war continued in flanders , catalonia , and italy wherever a spanish and a french garrison were face to face , and condé , with the wreck of his army , openly and defiantly entered the service of the king of spain at one moment , near péronne , condé had turenne at a serious disadvantage , but he could not galvanize the spanish general count fuensaldaña , who was more solicitous to preserve his master 's soldiers than to establish condé as mayor of the palace to the king of france , and the armies drew apart again without fighting on the night of 24–25 august the lines of circumvallation drawn round that place by the prince were brilliantly stormed by turenne 's army , and condé won equal credit for his safe withdrawal of the besieging corps under cover of a series of bold cavalry charges led by himself as usual , sword in hand the campaign of 1657 was uneventful , and is only to be remembered because a body of 6,000 english infantry , sent by cromwell in pursuance of his treaty of alliance with mazarin , took part in it
