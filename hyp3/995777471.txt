the macintosh ii project was begun by dhuey and berkeley during 1985 without the knowledge of apple co-founder and macintosh division head steve jobs , who opposed features like expansion slots and color , on the basis that the former complicated the user experience and the latter did not conform to wysiwyg , since color printers were not common retailing for us 5,498 , the macintosh ii was the first '' modular '' macintosh model , so called because it came in a horizontal desktop case like many ibm pc compatibles of the time because color quickdraw was included in the macintosh ii 's rom and relied on new 68020 instructions , earlier macintoshes could not be upgraded to display color the machine shipped with a socket for an mmu , but the '' apple hmmu chip '' ( vlsi vi475 chip ) was installed that did not implement virtual memory ( instead , it translated 24-bit addresses to 32-bit addresses for the mac os , which would not be 32-bit clean until system 7 ) apple announces 68030 macintosh iix with high density compatible drive by john cook and carol cochrane , business wire 09/19/88 ( retrieved september 20 , 2009 ) the mac ii had eight 30-pin simms , and memory was installed in groups of four ( called '' bank a '' and '' bank b '' ) the macintosh iix roms that also shipped with the fdhd upgrade fixed this problem , though still do not have a 32-bit memory manager and can not boot into 32-bit addressing mode under mac os ( without the assistance of mode32 ) graphics : the macintosh ii includes a graphics card that supports a true-color 16.7 million color palette and was available in two configurations : 4-bit and 8-bit expansion : six nubus slots were available for expansion ( at least one of which had to be used for a graphics card , as the mac ii had no onboard graphics chipset and the os did n't support headless booting ) another option for expansion included the mac286 , which included an intel 80286 chip and could be used for ms-dos compatibility the original roms in the macintosh ii contained a bug that prevented the system from recognizing more than one megabyte of memory address space on a nubus card accessories : the macintosh ii and macintosh se were the first apple computers since the apple i to be sold without a keyboard audio : the macintosh ii was the first macintosh to have the chimes of death accompany the sad mac logo whenever a serious hardware error occurred
