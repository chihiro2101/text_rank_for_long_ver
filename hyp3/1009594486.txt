at the age of about ten to twelve he and his brother francesco ( who perhaps followed later ) were sent to an uncle in venice to find an apprenticeship with a painter at that time the bellinis , especially giovanni , were the leading artists in the city francesco vecellio , titian 's older brother , later became a painter of some note in venice a fresco of hercules on the morosini palace is said to have been one of titian 's earliest works titian joined giorgione as an assistant , but many contemporary critics already found his work more impressive—for example in exterior frescoes ( now almost totally destroyed ) that they did for the fondaco dei tedeschi ( state-warehouse for the german merchants ) a substantial number of attributions have moved from giorgione to titian in the 20th century , with little traffic the other way one of the earliest known titian works , christ carrying the cross in the scuola grande di san rocco , depicting the ecce homo scene , was long regarded as by giorgione 11–14 the two young masters were likewise recognized as the leaders of their new school of arte moderna , which is characterized by paintings made more flexible , freed from symmetry and the remnants of hieratic conventions still found in the works of giovanni bellini some of their work is known , in part , through the engravings of fontana after giorgione 's early death in 1510 , titian continued to paint giorgionesque subjects for some time , though his style developed its own features , including bold and expressive brushwork titian 's talent in fresco is shown in those he painted in 1511 at padua in the carmelite church and in the scuola del santo , some of which have been preserved , among them the meeting at the golden gate , and three scenes ( miracoli di sant'antonio ) from the life of st anthony of padua , the miracle of the jealous husband , which depicts the murder of a young woman by her husband , '' new findings in titian 's fresco technique at

young man with a broken limb explained here he became superintendent of the government works , especially charged with completing the paintings left unfinished by giovanni bellini in the hall of the great council in the ducal palace during this period ( 1516–1530 ) , which may be called the period of his mastery and maturity , the artist moved on from his early giorgionesque style , undertook larger , more complex subjects , and for the first time attempted a monumental style this extraordinary piece of colourism , executed on a grand scale rarely before seen in italy , created a sensation 14 the signoria took note and observed that titian was neglecting his work in the hall of the great council , but in 1516 he succeeded his master giovanni bellini in receiving a pension from the senate 15 the pictorial structure of the assumption—that of uniting in the same composition two or three scenes superimposed on different levels , earth and heaven , the temporal and the infinite—was continued in a series of works such as the retable of san domenico at ancona ( 1520 ) , the retable of brescia ( 1522 ) , and the retable of san niccolò ( 1523 ) , in the vatican museums , each time attaining to a higher and more perfect conception to this period belongs a more extraordinary work , the death of st another work of the same period , also in the louvre , is the entombment '' finally this was the period when titian composed the half-length figures and busts of young women , probably courtesans , such as flora of the uffizi , or woman with a mirror in the louvre ( the scientific images of this painting are available , with explanations , on the website of the french center for research and restoration of the museums of france ) this painting was done for alessandro farnese , but a later variant was produced for philip ii , for whom titian painted many of his most important mythological paintings during the next period ( 1530–1550 ) , titian developed the style introduced by his dramatic death of st however , at the end of a year pordenone died , and titian , who meanwhile applied himself diligently to painting in the hall the battle of cadore , was reinstated this major battle scene was lost—with many other major works by venetian artists—in the 1577 fire that destroyed all the old pictures in the great chambers of the doge 's palace but this period of the master 's work is still represented by the presentation of the blessed virgin ( venice , 1539 ) , one of his most popular canvasses , and by the ecce homo ( vienna , 1541 ) they were nevertheless much admired and imitated , rubens among others applying this system to his forty ceilings ( the sketches only remain ) of the jesuit church at antwerp at this time also , during his visit to rome , the artist began a series of reclining venuses : the venus of urbino of the uffizi , venus and love at the same museum , venus and music , madrid , which shows the influence of contact with ancient sculpture as a matter of professional and worldly success , his position from about this time is regarded as equal only to that of raphael , michelangelo and , at a later date , rubens titian had a favorite villa on the neighboring manza hill ( in front of the church of castello roganzuolo ) from which ( it may be inferred ) he made his chief observations of landscape form and effect he could at the same time have succeeded the painter sebastiano del piombo in his lucrative office as holder of the piombo or papal seal , and he was prepared to take holy orders for the purpose ; but the project lapsed through his being summoned away from venice in 1547 to paint charles v and others in augsburg during the last twenty-six years of his life ( 1550–1576 ) , titian worked mainly for philip ii and as a portrait-painter titian was producing religious works for philip at the same time , some of which—the ones inside ribeira palace—are known to have been destroyed during the 1755 lisbon earthquake

repellent '' flaying of marsyas ( kroměříž , czech republic ) around 1560 , titian painted the oil on canvas madonna and child with saints luke and catherine of alexandria , a derivative on the motif of madonna ( art ) it is suggested that members of titian 's venice workshop probably painted the curtain and luke , because of the lower quality of those parts like many of his late works , titian 's last painting , the pietà , is a dramatic , nocturnal scene of suffering much later the austrian rulers of venice commissioned antonio canova to sculpt the large monument still in the church in the period 1517–1520 he designed a number of woodcuts , including an enormous and impressive one of the crossing of the red sea , intended as wall decoration in substitute for paintings ; schmidt , suzanne karr tintoretto had only been ten days in the studio when titian sent him home for good , because the great master observed some very spirited drawings , which he learned to be the production of tintoretto ; it is inferred that he became at once jealous of so promising a student several other artists of the vecelli family followed in the wake of titian francesco vecellio , his older brother , was introduced to painting by titian ( it is said at the age of twelve , but chronology will hardly admit of this ) , and painted in the church of s this was a noteworthy performance , of which titian ( the usual story ) became jealous ; so francesco was diverted from painting to soldiering , and afterwards to mercantile life marco vecellio , called marco di tiziano , born in 1545 , was titian 's nephew and was constantly with the master in his old age , and learned his methods of work his brother cesare , who also left some pictures , is well known by his book of engraved
