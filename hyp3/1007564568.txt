it is one of the most abundant organic polymers on earth , exceeded only by cellulose lignin constitutes 30 % of non-fossil organic carbon and 20 to 35 % of the dry mass of wood the relative amounts of the precursor '' monomers '' vary according to the plant source different types of lignin have been described depending on the means of isolation all lignins contain small amounts of incomplete or modified monolignols , and other monomers are prominent in non-woody plants lignin plays a crucial part in conducting water and aqueous nutrients in plant stems the polysaccharide components of plant cell walls are highly hydrophilic and thus permeable to water , whereas lignin is more hydrophobic thus , lignin makes it possible for the plant 's vascular tissue to conduct water efficiently lignin is present in all vascular plants , but not in bryophytes , supporting the idea that the original function of lignin was restricted to water transport it is covalently linked to hemicellulose and therefore cross-links different plant polysaccharides , conferring mechanical strength to the cell wall and by extension the plant as a whole its most commonly noted function is the support through strengthening of wood ( mainly composed of xylem cells and lignified sclerenchyma fibres ) in vascular plants also , can be used in making of biodegradable plastic along with cellulose as an alternative to hydrocarbon made plastics if lignin extraction is achieved through a more environmentally viable process than generic plastic manufacturing given that it is the most prevalent biopolymer after cellulose , lignin has been investigated as a feedstock for biofuel production and can become a crucial plant extract in the development of a new class of biofuels both peroxidase and laccase enzymes are present in the plant cell walls , and it is not known whether one or both of these groups participates in the polymerisation these radicals are often said to undergo uncatalyzed coupling to form the lignin polymer however the extent to which lignin does or does not degrade varies with species and plant tissue type dye-decolorizing peroxidases , or dyps , exhibit catalytic activity on a wide range of lignin model compounds , but their in vivo substrate is unknown many fungal laccases are also secreted , which facilitate degradation of phenolic lignin-derived compounds , although several intracellular fungal laccases have also been described bacteria lack most of the enzymes employed in fungal lignin degradation , yet bacterial degradation can be quite extensive in the environment , lignin can be degraded either biotically via bacteria or abiotically via photochemical alteration , and oftentimes the latter assists in the former these compounds are produced by thermal breakdown of lignin in the wood used in the smokehouse increases in the ( ad/al ) value indicate an oxidative cleavage reaction has occurred on the alkyl lignin side chain which has been shown to be a step in the decay of wood by many white-rot and some soft rot fungi
