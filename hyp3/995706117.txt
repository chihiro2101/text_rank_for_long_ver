the most important elements of this group are nitrogen ( n ) , which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air , and phosphorus ( p ) , which , like nitrogen , is essential to all known forms of life this is the property of these elements which leads to their potential toxicity , most evident in phosphorus , arsenic and antimony when these substances react with various chemicals of the body , they create strong free radicals not easily processed by the liver , where they accumulate paradoxically , it is this strong bonding which causes nitrogen and bismuth 's reduced toxicity ( when in molecules ) , as these form strong bonds with other atoms which are difficult to split , creating very unreactive molecules for example , n 2 , the diatomic form of nitrogen , is used as an inert gas in situations where using argon or another noble gas would be too expensive the light pnictogens ( nitrogen , phosphorus , and arsenic ) tend to form −3 charges when reduced , completing their octet going down the group , to phosphane ( phosphine ) , arsane ( arsine ) , stibane ( stibine ) , and finally bismuthane ( bismuthine ) , each pnictogen hydride becomes progressively less stable/more unstable , more toxic , and has a smaller hydrogen-hydrogen angle ( from 107.8° in ammonia to 90.48° in bismuthane ) ( also , technically , only ammonia and phosphane have the pnictogen in the −3 oxidation state because , for the rest , the pnictogen is less electronegative than hydrogen nitrogen forms a limited number of stable iii compounds phosphorus forms a +iii oxide which is stable at room temperature , phosphorous acid , and several trihalides , although the triiodide is unstable arsenic forms +iii compounds with oxygen as arsenites , arsenous acid , and arsenic ( iii ) oxide , and it forms all four trihalides moscovium is predicted to form all four trihalides , of which all but the trifluoride are predicted to be soluble in water for nitrogen , the +5 state is typically serves as only a formal explanation of molecules like dinitrogen pentoxide , as the high electronegativity of nitrogen causes the electrons to be shared almost evenly phosphorus even forms mixed oxide-halides , known as oxyhalides , like phosphorus oxychloride , and mixed pentahalides , like phosphorus trifluorodichloride however , for bismuth , the +5 oxidation state becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect , so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically nitrogen forms nitrogen oxide in which the nitrogen can take on a variety of oxidation states , including +ii , +iv , and even some mixed-valence compounds and very unstable +vi oxidation state in hydrazine , diphosphane , and organic derivatives of the two , the nitrogen/phosphorus atoms have the −2 oxidation state likewise , diimide , which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other , and diazene have nitrogen in the oxidation state of −1 this is predicted to cause +i to be a common oxidation state for moscovium , although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen the pnictogens consist of two non-metals ( one gas , one solid ) , two metalloids , one metal , and one element with unknown chemical properties nitrogen and bismuth , despite both being pnictogens , are very different in their physical properties arsenic is one of only two elements to sublimate at standard pressure ; it does this at 603 & nbsp ; °c the antimony mineral stibnite may have been a component of greek fire the majority of nitrogen on earth is in the form of nitrogen gas , but some nitrate minerals do exist nitrogen makes up 2.5 % of a typical human by weight phosphorus makes up 1.1 % of a typical human by weight the principal method for producing phosphorus is to reduce phosphates with carbon in an electric arc furnace however , it is also possible to make metallic arsenic by heating arsenopyrite at 650 to 700 & nbsp ; °c without oxygen if the ore contains 45 % to 60 % antimony by weight , antimony is obtained by heating the ore , also known as liquidation nitrogen in the form of ammonia is a nutrient critical to most plants ' survival arsenic was historically used as a paris green pigment , but is not used this way anymore due to its extreme toxicity arsenic in the form of organoarsenic chemistry is sometimes used in chicken feed antimony currency was briefly used in the 1930s in parts of china , but this use was discontinued as antimony is both soft and toxic phosphorus in the form of phosphates occur in compounds important to life , such as dna and atp plants take up only trace amounts of antimony many nitrogen compounds such as hydrogen cyanide and nitrogen-based explosives are also highly dangerous elemental arsenic is toxic , as are many of its inorganic compounds ; however some of its organic compounds can promote growth in chickens however , consumption of soluble bismuth salts can turn a person 's gums black
