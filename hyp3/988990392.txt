the main village of braunston is situated on a hill above the road and the canals , and formerly had a windmill , the building of which still stands but without any sails otherwise known as the '' cathedral of the canals '' , it has existed since the early 13th century however , the land on which is stands has been sacred for longer still , as it was used as an ancient tumulus for the local farmsteads as early as the 10th century , although little evidence to this time is available although the original norman structure was nearly demolished when the site was polluted by several murders in 1290 , the church was later rebuilt in the 14th century the second incarnation of the church served the area for over 400 years , until the site was demolished , with authority from rev the body of the church was made wider to provide accommodation for the enlarged population which had followed the coming of the canals today the church still provides regular services to the area , and often allows visitors to tour the ancient grounds , on non-service days this was not the original meeting point of the grand junction and oxford canals : the junction was moved in the course of improvements to the oxford canal in the 1830s , prior to which the junction was near where the marina is today , and where a third horseley ironworks bridge can be seen despite its small size , braunston was once served by two railway stations , both now closed this was the last main line to be constructed from the north of england to london and opened in march 1899
