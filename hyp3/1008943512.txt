indeed it would not be difficult to reduce all under two : 'equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy ' and 'equity acts on the person ' '' sometimes phrased as '' equity regards as done what should have been done '' , this maxim means that when individuals are required , by their agreements or by law , to perform some act of legal significance , equity will regard that act as having been done as it ought to have been done , even before it has actually happened when parties enter a contract for a sale of realty , the buyer is deemed to have obtained an equitable right that becomes a legal right only after the deal is completed due to his equitable interest in the outcome of the transaction , the buyer who suffers a breach may be entitled to the equitable remedy of specific performance ( although not always , see below ) if he is successful in seeking a remedy at law , he is entitled to the value of the property at the time of breach regardless of whether it has appreciated or depreciated the fair solution in the circumstances may be arrived at by applying the principle that equity regards that as done that ought to be done in other words , what would the position have been if what should have been done had been done ? thus , we know in one case , premiums on a life insurance policy were overdue it was clear that if the notice had been received by the policyholder , he or his wife would have taken steps to ensure the policy continued in force , because the policyholder was terminally ill at the time and the coverage provided by the policy was something his wife was plainly going to require in the foreseeable future since the policyholder would have been fully entitled to pay the outstanding premium at that stage , regardless of his physical condition , the insurer ( with some persuasion from the bureau ) agreed that the matter should be dealt with as if the policyholder had done so this was done without reference to the insurer concerned whose normal practice in such circumstances would have been to maintain coverage and to require payment of the full premium until proof of the no claims discount was forthcoming the stronger hand is the one that has the capacity to ask for a legal remedy ( judicial relief ) equity proceeds in the principle that a right or liability should as far as possible be equalized among all interested in other words , two parties have equal right in any property , so it is distributed equally as per the concerned law generally speaking , near performance of a general obligation will be treated as sufficient unless the law requires perfect performance , such as in the exercise of an option where a claimant is under an obligation to do one thing but does another , his action may be treated as close enough approximation of the required act nevertheless , courts of equity also developed a doctrine that an applicant must assert a '' property interest '' rather , it means that they came to require that the applicant assert a right of some significant substance as opposed to a claim for relief based on an injury to mere emotional or dignitary interests at common law , a mortgage was a conveyance of the property , with a condition subsequent , that if the grantor paid the secured indebtedness to the grantee on or before a date certain ( the '' law '' day ) then the condition subsequent would be void , otherwise to remain in full force and effect and the equity courts granted these petitions quite regularly and often without regard for the amount of time that had lapsed since the law day had passed the lender could interpose a defense of laches , saying that so much time had gone by ( and so much improvement and betterment had taken place ) that it would be inequitable to require undoing the finality of the mortgage conveyance it is often stated that one who comes into equity must come with clean hands ( or alternatively , equity will not permit a party to profit by his own wrong ) however , the requirement of clean hands does not mean that a '' bad person '' can not obtain the aid of equity the decision to accept the money would not normally be binding in contract law , and afterwards the builders sued the rees for the outstanding amount however , lord denning refused to apply the doctrine , on the grounds that the rees had taken unfair advantage of the builders ' financial difficulties , and therefore had not come '' with clean hands '' when a court of equity is presented with a good claim to equitable relief , and it is clear that the plaintiff also sustained monetary damages , the court of equity has jurisdiction to render legal relief , e.g this maxim , also expressed as aequitas sequitur legem , means more fully that '' equity will not allow a remedy that is contrary to law story states '' where a rule , either of the common or the statute law is direct , and governs the case with all its circumstances , or the particular point , a court of equity is as much bound by it as a court of law , and can as little justify a departure from it '' the goal of law and equity was the same but due to historical reasons they chose a different path equity respected every word of law and every right at law but where the law was defective , in those cases , equity provides equitable right and remedies in modern-day england and wales , this maxim no longer applies ; as per section 49 ( 1 ) of the senior courts act 1981 , the law follows equity instead : : subject to the provisions of this or any other act , every court exercising jurisdiction in england or wales in any civil cause or matter shall continue to administer law and equity on the basis that , wherever there is any conflict or variance between the rules of equity and the rules of the common law with reference to the same matter , the rules of equity shall prevail restitution could provide means of recovery when people bestowed benefits on one another ( such as giving money or providing services ) according to contracts that would have been legally unenforceable however , there are certain relaxations to the maxim , including the rule of re rose of where the donor has “ done all in his power to divest himself of and to transfer ” the property , re rose 1952 ch 499 , 515 and the more recent but controversial use of unconscionability as a method of dispensing a formality requirement equity will provide no specific remedies where the parties ' causes are to be seen to be equal , or where neither has been wronged equity could alter that status quo , ignoring the clearly imposed limits of legal relief , or legal defences if the law firmly denied a cause of action or suggested equities between the parties were as a matter of policy equal , equity would provide no relief ; if the law did provide relief , then the applicant would be obligated to bring a legal , rather than equitable action due to limits in old common law , no remedy was had for beneficiaries if , for example , a trustee ran off with the trust property
