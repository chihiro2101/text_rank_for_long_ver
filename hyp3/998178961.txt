the first seed of the story 's first chapter the horror in clay came from one of lovecraft 's own dreams he had in 1919 , which he described briefly in two different letters sent to his friend rheinhart kleiner on may 21 and december 14 , 1920 '' this can be compared to what the character of henry anthony wilcox tells the main character 's uncle while showing him his sculpted bas-relief for help in reading hieroglyphs on it which came through wilcox 's own fantastical dreams : : '' it is new , indeed , for i made it last night in a dream of strange cities ; and dreams are older than brooding tyre or the contemplative sphinx , or garden-girdled babylon '' lovecraft then used this for a brief synopsis of a new story outlined in his own commonplace book at first in august 1925 , which developed organically out of the idea of what the bas-relief in the dream actually might have depicted in a footnote for his writing down of his own dream , lovecraft then finished with the suggestion '' add good development & describe nature of bas-relief '' to himself for future reference price claims the irregular sonnet '' the kraken '' , the kraken , the victorian web written in 1830 by alfred tennyson , was a major inspiration for lovecraft 's story , as both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity at the bottom of the ocean and destined to emerge from its slumber in an apocalyptic age schultz cited other literary inspirations : guy de maupassant 's '' the horla '' ( 1887 ) , which lovecraft described in supernatural horror in literature as concerning '' an invisible being who.sways the minds of others , and seems to be the vanguard of a horde of extraterrestrial organisms arrived on earth to subjugate and overwhelm mankind '' ; and arthur machen 's '' the novel of the black seal '' ( 1895 ) , which uses the same method of piecing together of disassociated knowledge ( including a random newspaper clipping ) to reveal the survival of a horrific ancient being it is also assumed he got inspiration from william scott-elliot 's the story of atlantis ( 1896 ) and the lost lemuria ( 1904 ) , which lovecraft read in 1926 shortly before he started to work on the story another dunsany work cited by price is a shop in go-by street ( 1919 ) , which stated '' the heaven of the gods who sleep '' , and '' unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he sleeps being still deep in slumber '' this passage is also believed to have inspired lovecraft 's entity azathoth , hence the title of price 's essay joshi says that , 'merritt 's mention of a '' moon-door '' that , when tilted , leads the characters into a lower region of wonder and horror seems similar to the huge door whose inadvertent opening by the sailors causes cthulhu to emerge from r'lyeh' the first chapter , '' the horror in clay '' , concerns a small bas-relief sculpture found among the notes , which the narrator describes : '' my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus , a dragon , and a human caricature the second chapter , '' the tale of inspector legrasse '' , discusses the first time the professor had heard the word '' cthulhu '' and seen a similar image '' one particularly talkative cultist , known as old castro , named the center of their cult as iram of the pillars in arabia , and referred to a phrase in the necronomicon : '' that is not dead which can eternal lie , and with strange aeons even death may die after finishing the manuscript , thurston realizes he 's now a possible target , thinking : '' i know too much , and the cult still lives lovecraft regarded the short story as '' rather middlingâ€”not as bad as the worst , but full of cheap and cumbrous touches '' howard ( the creator of conan ) as '' a masterpiece , which i am sure will live as one of the highest achievements of literature lovecraft scholar peter cannon regarded the story as '' ambitious and complex.a dense and subtle narrative in which the horror gradually builds to cosmic proportions '' , adding '' one of lovecraft 's bleakest fictional expressions of man 's insignificant place in the universe '' lovecraft : against the world , against life , described the story as the first of lovecraft 's '' great texts '' in addition , they released '' the thing that should not be '' on their 1986 album master of puppets , '' all nightmare long '' on 2008 's death magnetic , and '' dream no more '' on 2016 's hardwired in 2020 , elements of the call of cthulhu were adapted in the science fiction horror film underwater , directed by william eubank and released by 20th century fox in 2018 , the villain black manta in the movie aquaman directed by james wan and released by dc quotes '' the call of chulthu '' : '' loathsomeness waits , and dreams in the deep , and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men ''
