yet geoffrey also refers to king hoel of brittany as arthur 's nephew and presents a prophecy that to uther 's daughter will be born a line of seven kings , something true if hoel is anna 's son , but not true if only gawain or mordred are anna 's sons there is confusion here , especially as welsh genealogies name an anna as hoel 's mother , but one not connected to uther pendragon the same source mentions gormant son of rica , half-brother to arthur on his mother 's side , while his father is the chief elder of cornwall in robert de boron 's poem merlin , igraine 's previous husband is an unnamed duke of tintagel and it is by him that she becomes the mother of two unnamed daughters a third illegitimate daughter of the duke of tintagel is sent to a school and there learns so much she becomes the great sorceress morgan le fay ( no other medieval accounts state that morgan is illegitimate and therefore , as in this version , arthur 's stepsister ) in the lancelot-grail cycle 's vulgate merlin , igraine is provided with two earlier husbands , one named hoel who is the father of two daughters : gawain 's mother and a daughter named blasine who marries king nentres of garlot ( it is possible this hoel derives from geoffrey 's confused statement that igraine 's eldest daughter had by her first husband howel which was misunderstood to refer instead to a supposed first husband of igraine named howel/hoel ) after hoel 's death ygraine marries the duke of tintagel and by him becomes mother of three more daughters : a third daughter who marries a king briadas and becomes mother of king angusel of scotland ( in no other extant text made arthur 's nephew ) , a fourth daughter named hermesent who marries king urien of rheged and becomes mother of ywain the great , and a fifth daughter , morgan arthurian tales are not consistent with one another and sisters of arthur seem to have been created at desire by any storyteller who wished to make a hero into arthur 's nephew the lancelot-grail relates that when igraine became uther 's wife she left behind in the dukedom of tintagel a son of the duke of tintagel by a previous marriage
