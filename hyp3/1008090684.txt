human vision is confined to a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light many animals have a tissue layer called the tapetum lucidum in the back of the eye that reflects light back through the retina , increasing the amount of light available for it to capture , but reducing the sharpness of the focus of the image examples of such technologies include night glasses and low light cameras in the military context , image intensifiers are often called '' low light tv '' since the video signal is often transmitted to a display within a control center these are usually integrated into a sensor containing both visible and ir detectors and the streams are used independently or in fused mode , depending on the mission at hand 's requirements the image intensifier is a vacuum-tube based device ( photomultiplier tube ) that can generate an image from a very small number of photons ( such as the light from stars in the sky ) so that a dimly lit scene can be viewed in real-time by the naked eye via visual output , or stored as data for later analysis the image is said to become '' intensified '' because the output visible light is brighter than the incoming light , and this effect directly relates to the difference in passive and active night vision goggles examples of such technologies include low light cameras because active infrared night-vision systems can incorporate illuminators that produce high levels of infrared light , the resulting images are typically higher resolution than other night-vision technologies gated imaging technology can be divided into single shot , where the detector captures the image from a single light pulse , and multi-shot , where the detector integrates the light pulses from multiple shots to form an image one of the key advantages of this technique is the ability to perform target recognition rather than mere detection , as is the case with thermal imaging some organisms are able to sense a crude thermal image by means of special organs that function as bolometers thermal imaging cameras make small temperature differences visible when coupled with additional cameras ( for example , a visible spectrum camera or swir ) multispectral sensors are possible , which take advantage of the benefits of each detection band 's capabilities before the introduction of image intensifiers , night glasses were the only method of night vision , and thus were widely utilized , especially at sea other types include monocular night vision devices with only one eyepiece which may be mounted to firearms as night sights large lenses can gather and concentrate light , thus intensifying light with purely optical means and enabling the user to see better in the dark than with the naked eye alone such systems typically use infrared cameras , sometimes combined with active illumination techniques , to collect information that is then displayed to the driver
