the rear wheel of a recumbent is usually behind the rider and may be any size , from around to the 700c ( or 27 '' on some older models , as on upright road bikes of that time ) of an upright racing cycle given the higher rolling resistance of the smaller front wheel , loss of steering and control are somewhat more likely attempting sharp or quick changes of direction while crossing over patches of loose dirt , sand or pebbles high-racer aficionados also claim that they are more stable , and although it is easier to balance a bicycle with a higher center of mass , the wide variety of recumbent designs makes such generalizations unreliable another advantage of both wheels being the same size is that the bike requires only one size of inner tube the small front wheel and large rear wheel combination is used to keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other , avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called '' heel strike '' ( where the rider 's heels catch the wheel in tight turns ) a pivoting-boom front-wheel drive ( pbfwd aka moving bottom bracket recumbent ) configuration also overcomes heel strike since the pedals and front wheel turn together pbfwd bikes may have dual wheels or larger oss/ass is generally direct—the steerer acts on the front fork like a standard bicycle handlebar—but the bars themselves may extend well behind the front wheel ( more like a tiller ) ; alternatively the bars might have long rearward extensions ( sometimes known as superman or kingcycle bars ) however , due to the proximity of the crank to the front wheel , front wheel drive ( fwd ) can be an option , and it allows for a much shorter chain one style requires the chain to twist slightly to allow for steering in addition to the much shorter chain , the advantages to pbfwd are use of a larger front wheel for lower rolling resistance without heel strike ( you can pedal while turning ) and use of the upper body when sprinting or climbing another disadvantage of pbfwd for some riders is a slightly longer '' learning curve '' due to adaptation to the pedal-steer effect ( forces applied to the pedal can actually steer the bike ) yet another drive-train variation is on rowing cycles where the rider rows using arms and legs modern recumbent bikes are increasingly being fitted with front and rear suspension systems for increased comfort and traction on rough surfaces the maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided the development of these designs , which often use many of the same parts , suitably modified for recumbent use fairings are also available for upright bikes , but are much less common large-diameter wheels , mountain gearing and off-road specific design have been used since 1999 the extreme reclined position , and the fact that the rider is sitting in line with the wheels rather than atop them , makes this type the most aerodynamic of unfaired recumbents the seating position may be otherwise identical to that on a lowracer allowing similar aerodynamics '' racer '' in the name implies that this will often be the case , since these bikes strive for speed given the same seating position they may be faster than lowracers , since it is widely believed that rolling resistance is inversely proportional to wheel diameter the reasoning is that the riders body is in line with the wheels , reducing drag a common configuration for two riders in the recumbent position is the sociable tandem , wherein the two riders ride side by side they usually follow a delta design with front wheels driven by standard dérailleur gearing powered by hand cranks although arms are weaker than legs , many hand cyclists are able to make use of the power of the whole upper body recumbent cycles offer the possibility of combined hand and foot power inputs , and thus the potential for a full-body workout , and the option for persons with a weak or missing leg ( s ) to power a cycle in one recumbent tricycle design the user makes the two front wheels change direction by shifting his center of weight , and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel when two and sometimes four riders want to ride together in a sociable configuration the four-wheel recumbent cycle is a viable option like a regular stationary exercise bike , these stay in one place and the user pedals against some kind of resistance mechanism such as a fan or alternator but in a recumbent position before the shape of the bicycle settled down following starley 's safety bicycle , there was a good deal of experimentation with various arrangements , and this included designs which might be considered recumbent on 1 april 1934 , the uci published a new definition of a racing bicycle that specified how high the bottom bracket could be above the ground , how far it could be in front of the seat and how close it could be to the front wheel the avatar 2000 , a lwb bike very much like the current easy racers products , arrived in 1979 although sold as an '' electric car '' , the c5 could be characterised as a recumbent tricycle with electrical assistance the official record for an upright bicycle under ihpva-legal conditions ( but at sea level , not high altitude ) is set by jim glover in 1986 with an english-made moulton bicycle with a usa-made hardshell fairing around him and the bike
