it is also used , albeit infrequently , in severe rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases the increase in blood pressure can cause cardiovascular events ; it is thus recommended that the lowest effective dose for people requiring long-term treatment be used use of azathioprine as an alternative has shown to reduce the incidence of gouty arthritis there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans ) , agents classified by the iarc monographs , volumes 1â€“110 specifically leading to squamous cell skin cancer and non-hodgkin lymphoma when open , enters the mitochondria and causes the muscle cells ( and thus the heart ) to contract the metabolites , which include cyclosporin b , c , d , e , h , and l , have less than 10 % of ciclosporin 's immunosuppressant activity and are associated with higher kidney toxicity tolypocladium inflatum , the species currently used for mass production of cyclosporin , has the biosynthetic genes arranged into a 12-gene cluster these genes are associated with an active retrotransposon two related components that had antifungal activity were isolated from extracts from these fungi the immunosuppressive effect of the natural product ciclosporin was discovered in december 1971 in a screening test on immune suppression designed and implemented by hartmann f ciclosporin exhibits very poor solubility in water , and , as a consequence , suspension and emulsion forms of the medication have been developed for oral administration and for injection ciclosporin is currently in a phase ii/iii ( adaptive ) clinical study in europe to determine its ability to ameliorate neuronal cellular damage and reperfusion injury ( phase iii ) in traumatic brain injury ciclosporin has been investigated as a possible neuroprotective agent in conditions such as traumatic brain injury , and has been shown in animal experiments to reduce brain damage associated with injury ciclosporin blocks the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore , which has been found to cause much of the damage associated with head injury and neurodegenerative diseases ciclosporin has been used experimentally to treat cardiac hypertrophy ( an increase in cell volume ) constitutively high levels of mitochondrial cause inappropriate mptp opening leading to a decrease in the cardiac range of function , leading to cardiac hypertrophy as an attempt to compensate for the problem csa binds to cyclophilin d to block the opening of mptp , and thus decreases the release of protein cytochrome c , which can cause programmed cell death cypd is a protein within the mptp that acts as a gate ; binding by csa decreases the amount of inappropriate opening of mptp , which decreases the intramitochondrial unlike the human form of the medication , the lower doses used in dogs mean the drug acts as an immunomodulator and has fewer side effects than in humans
