the norwegian forest cat is adapted to survive norway 's cold weather its ancestors may include black and white shorthair cats brought to norway from great britain some time after 1000 ad by the vikings , and longhaired cats brought to norway by crusaders these cats could have reproduced with farm and feral stock and may have eventually evolved into the modern-day norwegian forest breed '' since the norwegian forest cat is a very adept climber , author claire bessant believes that the skogkatt folktale could be about the ancestor of the modern norwegian forest breed the original landrace lived in the norwegian forests for many centuries , but were later prized for their hunting skills and were used on norwegian farms , until they were discovered in the early twentieth century by cat enthusiasts owing to crossbreed with free-ranging domestic cats during the war , the norwegian forest cat became endangered and nearly extinct until the norwegian forest cat club helped the breed make a comeback by developing an official breeding program the norwegian forest cat is strongly built and larger than an average cat those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters , but the breed can also adapt to indoor life the cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old a naturally occurring orthologue of human gsd iv was described previously in norwegian forest cats ( nfc ) there are dna tests available for gsd iv , and it is highly recommended ( some cat associations obligate their norwegian forest cat breeder members ) to carry out the dna test before using such animals for breeding pawpeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes , through publishing each single cat 's test result , to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision
