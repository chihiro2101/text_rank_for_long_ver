if the gain is large , but slightly less than 1 , then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created , but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system , such as through a microphone professional setups circumvent feedback by placing the main speakers a far distance from the band or artist , and then having several smaller speakers known as monitors pointing back at each band member , but in the opposite direction to that in which the microphones are pointing this allows independent control of the sound pressure levels for the audience and the performers feedback can be reduced manually by '' ringing out '' a sound system prior to a performance the sound engineer can increase the level of a microphone or guitar pickup until feedback occurs many professional sound engineers can identify feedback frequencies by ear but others use a real time analyzer to identify the ringing frequency to intentionally create feedback , an electric guitar player needs a guitar amplifier and a loudspeaker cabinet , with very high gain ( amplification ) and/or the guitar brought near the speaker the who 's 1965 hits '' anyway , anyhow , anywhere '' and '' my generation '' featured feedback manipulation by pete townshend , with an extended solo in the former and the shaking of his guitar in front of the amplifier to create a throbbing noise in the latter szab√≥ 's method included the use of a flat top acoustic guitar with a magnetic pickup lou reed created his album metal machine music ( 1975 ) entirely from loops of feedback played at various speeds the entire guitar solo was created using amplifier feedback examples of feedback combined with a quick volume swell used as a transition include weezer 's '' my name is jonas '' and '' say it ai n't so '' ; the strokes ' '' reptilia '' , '' new york city cops '' , and '' juicebox '' ; dream theater 's '' as i am '' ; as well as numerous tracks by meshuggah and tool cacophonous feedback fade-outs ending a song are most often used to generate rather than relieve tension , often cross-faded too after a thematic and musical release though closed circuit feedback was a prominent feature in many early experimental electronic music compositions , it was contemporary american composer robert ashley who first used acoustic feedback as sound material in his work the wolfman ( 1964 ) steve reich makes extensive use of audio feedback in his work pendulum music ( 1968 ) by swinging a series of microphones back and forth in front of their corresponding amplifiers pitched melodies may be created entirely from feedback through changing the angle between a guitar and amplifier after establishing a feedback loop the principle of feedback is used in many guitar sustain devices intended closed-circuit feedback can also be created by an effects unit , such as a delay pedal or effect fed back into a mixing console
