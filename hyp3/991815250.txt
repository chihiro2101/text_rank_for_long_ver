however , unlike oligodendrocytes , each myelinating schwann cell provides insulation to only one axon ( see image ) myelinating schwann cells begin to form the myelin sheath in mammals during fetal development and work by spiraling around the axon , sometimes with as many as 100 revolutions following this process , the schwann cells can guide regeneration by forming a type of tunnel that leads toward the target neurons successful axons can , therefore , reconnect with the muscles or organs they previously controlled with the help of schwann cells , but specificity is not maintained and errors are frequent , especially when long distances are involved sox10 is a transcription factor active during embryonic development and abundant evidence indicates that it is essential for the generation of glial lineages from trunk crest cells when sox10 is inactivated in mice , satellite glia and schwann cell precursors fail to develop , though neurons are generated normally without issue in the absence of sox10 , neural crest cells survive and are free to generate neurons , but glial specification is blocked during embryonic development , nrg1 inhibits the formation of neurons from neural crest cells , instead contributing to neural crest cells being led down a path to gliogenesis it is found in the dorsal root ganglion and motor neurons at the point in time that schwann cell precursors begin to populate spinal nerves and therefore influences schwann cell survival unexpectedly , p0- mice also showed degeneration of both axons and their surround myelin sheaths , suggesting that p0 plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of both myelin formation and the axon with which it â€™ s associated p0 is also an important gene expressed early within the schwann cell lineage , expressed in schwann cell precursors after differentiating from migrating neural crest within the developing embryo in this way , in krox-20 double knock out mice , it has been recorded that hindbrain segmentation is affected as well as myelination of schwann cell associated axons indeed , in these mice , the schwann cells are not able to perform their myelination properly as they only wrap their cytoplasmic processes one and half turn around the axon and despite the fact that they still express the early myelin marker , late myelin gene products are absent in addition , recent studies have also proven the importance of this transcription factor in maintaining the myelination phenotype ( and requires the co-expression of sox 10 ) as its inactivation leads to dedifferentiation of the schwann cells
