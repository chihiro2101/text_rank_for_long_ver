logistics is generally concerned with cost centre service activities , but provides value via improved efficiency and customer satisfaction it is based on the basic premise that the supply and distribution activities if integrated with the manufacturing / logistic activities , can result in better profitability for the organization for example , if we want to produce a system that is 95 % reliable ( or improve a system to achieve 95 % reliability ) , a logistics engineer understands that total system reliability can be no greater than the least reliable subsystem or component if a subsystem is only 50 % reliable , one can concentrate on improving the reliability of that subsystem , design in multiple subsystems in parallel ( 5 in this case would achieve approximately 97 % reliability of that subsystem ) , purchase and store spare subsystems for rapid change out , establish repair capability that would get a failed subsystem back in operation in the required amount of time , and/or choose any combination of those approaches to achieve the optimal cost vs the various fields and topics that logistics engineers are involved with include : customer service : provision of services to customers before , during and after a purchase purchasing : acquiring goods or services to accomplish its goals sourcing : procurement practices , aimed at finding , evaluating and engaging suppliers for acquiring goods and services demand forecasting : the art and science of forecasting customer demand to drive holistic execution of such demand by corporate supply chain and business management facility location : the optimal placement of facilities to minimize transportation costs while considering factors like avoiding placing hazardous materials near housing , and competitors ' facilities layout design inventory control : the activity of checking a shop â€™ s stock material handling : short-distance movement within the confines of a building or between a building and a transportation vehicle warehousing distribution system design reliability engineering : sub-discipline of systems engineering that emphasizes dependability in the lifecycle management of a product reverse logistics : the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value , or proper disposal green logistics : attempts to measure and minimize the ecological impact of logistics activities intermodal transport supportability analysis different performance metrics ( measures of performance ) are used to examine the efficiency of an organization 's logistics these programs generally combine strategy , operations , facility design , technology and management
