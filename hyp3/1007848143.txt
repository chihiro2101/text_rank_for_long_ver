due to the way glycogen is synthesised , every glycogen granule has at its core a glycogenin protein glucose is an osmotic molecule , and can have profound effects on osmotic pressure in high concentrations possibly leading to cell damage or death if stored in the cell without being modified glycogen is a non-osmotic molecule , so it can be used as a solution to storing glucose in the cell without disrupting osmotic pressure glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful for the next 8â€“12 hours , glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel in response to insulin levels being below normal ( when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range ) , glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis ( the breakdown of glycogen ) and gluconeogenesis ( the production of glucose from other sources ) muscle cell glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells as muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase , which is required to pass glucose into the blood , the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells this is in contrast to liver cells , which , on demand , readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs the branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 & nbsp ; residues , and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains in hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin , liver glycogen levels are high , but the high insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways : first , during exercise , carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose ( high glycemic index ) are ingested continuously
