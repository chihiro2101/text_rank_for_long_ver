bulimia typically involves rapid and out-of-control eating , which may stop when the person is interrupted by another person or the stomach hurts from over-extension , followed by self-induced vomiting or other forms of purging people with bulimia nervosa may also exercise to a point that excludes other activities in relation to interoceptive sensitivity , hyposensitive individuals may not detect feelings of fullness in a normal and timely fashion , and therefore are prone to eating more calories people with bulimia are more likely than people without bulimia to have an affective spectrum , such as depression or general anxiety disorder one study found 70 % had depression at some time in their lives ( as opposed to 26 % for adult females in the general population ) , rising to 88 % for all affective disorders combined another study by the royal children 's hospital in melbourne on a cohort of 2,000 adolescents similarly found that those meeting at least two of the dsm-iv criteria for bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa had a sixfold increase in risk of anxiety and a doubled risk for substance dependency bulimia has been compared to drug addiction , though the empirical support for this characterization is limited however , people with bulimia nervosa may share dopamine d2 receptor-related vulnerabilities with those with substance abuse disorders abnormal blood levels of peptides important for the regulation of appetite and energy balance are observed in individuals with bulimia nervosa , but it remains unknown if this is a state or trait in addition , the suicide rate among people with bulimia nervosa is 7.5 times higher than in the general population in contrast , byrne and mclean 's findings differed slightly from fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa in that the drive for thinness was the major cause of purging as a way of controlling weight in addition , the cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is very cultural bound in that it may not be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of the western society furthermore , it is difficult to ascertain cause and effect , because it may be that distorted eating leads to distorted cognition rather than vice versa thus , people feeling uncomfortable with their bodies may result in suffering from body dissatisfaction and may develop a certain drive for thinness consequently , body dissatisfaction coupled with a drive for thinness is thought to promote dieting and negative effects , which could eventually lead to bulimic symptoms such as purging or bingeing papies showed that it is not the thin ideal itself , but rather the self-association with other persons of a certain weight that decide how someone with bulimia nervosa feels p.344 bulimia nervosa may affect up to 1 % of young women and , after 10 years of diagnosis , half will recover fully , a third will recover partially , and 10–20 % will still have symptoms many bulimics may also engage in significantly disordered eating and exercise patterns without meeting the full diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa p.343 the diagnostic criteria utilized by the dsm-5 includes repetitive episodes of binge eating ( a discrete episode of overeating during which the individual feels out of control of consumption ) compensated for by excessive or inappropriate measures taken to avoid gaining weight p.343 the diagnosis is made only when the behavior is not a part of the symptom complex of anorexia nervosa and when the behavior reflects an overemphasis on physical mass or appearance cognitive behavioral therapy ( cbt ) , which involves teaching a person to challenge automatic thoughts and engage in behavioral experiments ( for example , in session eating of '' forbidden foods '' ) has a small amount of evidence supporting its use by using cbt people record how much food they eat and periods of vomiting with the purpose of identifying and avoiding emotional fluctuations that bring on episodes of bulimia on a regular basis barker ( 2003 ) states that research has found 40–60 % of people using cognitive behaviour therapy to become symptom free people undergoing cbt who exhibit early behavioral changes are most likely to achieve the best treatment outcomes in the long run some positive outcomes of treatments can include : abstinence from binge eating , a decrease in obsessive behaviors to lose weight and in shape preoccupation , less severe psychiatric symptoms , a desire to counter the effects of binge eating , as well as an improvement in social functioning and reduced relapse rates bulimia is thought to be more prevalent among caucasians ; however , a more recent study showed that african-american teenage girls were 50 percent more likely than caucasian girls to exhibit bulimic behavior , including both binging and purging historical records also suggest that some saints who developed anorexia ( as a result of a life of asceticism ) may also have displayed bulimic behaviors at the turn of the century , bulimia ( overeating ) was described as a clinical symptom , but rarely in the context of weight control purging , however , was seen in anorexic patients and attributed to gastric pain rather than another method of weight control several case studies from this era reveal patients suffering from the modern description of bulimia nervosa however , while these patients may have met modern criteria for bulimia nervosa , they can not technically be diagnosed with the disorder , as it had not yet appeared in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders at the time of their treatment an explanation for the increased instances of bulimic symptoms may be due to the 20th century 's new ideals of thinness however , bulimia nervosa 's prevalence was still much higher than anorexia nervosa 's , which at the time occurred in about 14 people per 100,000
