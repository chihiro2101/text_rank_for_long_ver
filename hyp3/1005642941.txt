the 2012 united states census of agriculture defines a family farm as '' any farm where the majority of the business is owned by the operator and individuals related to the operator , including relatives who do not live in the operator ’ s household '' ; it defines a farm as '' any place from which 1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold , or normally would have been sold , during a given year the food and agriculture organization of the united nations defines a '' family farm '' as one that relies primarily on family members for labour and management for example , in the united states , under federal farm ownership loan regulations , the definition of a '' family farm '' does not specify the nature of farm ownership , and management of the farm is either by the borrower , or by members operating the farm when a loan is made to a corporation , co-operative or other entity in the roman republic , latifundia , great landed estates , specialised in agriculture destined for export , producing grain , olive oil , or wine , corresponding largely to modern industrialized agriculture but depending on slave labour instead of mechanization , developed after the second punic war and increasingly replaced the former system of family-owned small or intermediate farms in the roman empire period mechanization enabled the cultivation of much larger areas than what was typical for the traditional estates aimed at subsistence farming , resulting in the emergence of a smaller number of large farms , with the displaced population partly contributing to the new class of wage labour and partly emigrating to the new world or the russian empire ( following the serfdom in russia ) thomas jefferson 's argument that a large number of family estates are a factor in ensuring the stability of democracy was repeatedly used in support of subsidies it is in these nations very often a political rallying cry against change in agricultural policy , most commonly in france , japan , and the united states , where rural lifestyles are often regarded as desirable on other economic matters they were seen as generally opposed , but found common ground on this one the social roles of family farms are much changed today however , agricultural activities have taken on many forms and change over time farm wives often need to find work away from the farm to supplement farm income and children sometimes have no interest in farming as their chosen field of work bolder promoters argue that as agriculture has become more efficient with the application of modern management and new technologies in each generation , the idealized classic family farm is now simply obsolete , or more often , unable to compete without the economies of scale available to larger and more modern farms advocates argue that family farms in all nations need to be protected , as the basis of rural society and social stability overall , ninety-one percent of farms in the united states are considered '' small family farms '' ( with sales of less than 250,000 per year ) , and those farms produce twenty-seven percent of u.s wholesale infrastructure : a farmer growing larger quantities of a crop than can be sold directly to consumers has to meet a range of criteria for sale into the wholesale market , which include harvest timing and graded quality , and may also include variety , therefore , the market channel really determines most aspects of the farm decisionmaking real estate prices : the growth of urban centers around the world , and the resulting urban sprawl have caused the price of centrally located farmland to skyrocket , while reducing the local infrastructure necessary to support farming , putting effectively intense pressure on many farmers to sell out for the family farm this new technology and increasingly complex marketing strategy has presented new and unprecedented challenges , and not all family farmers have been able to effectively cope with the changing market conditions the '' new family farm '' provides an alternative market in some localities with an array of traditionally and naturally produced products viable farms on a scale sufficient to support modern families at an income level commensurate with urban and suburban upper-middle-class families are often large scale operations , both in area and capital requirements these farms , family owned and operated in a technologically and economically conventional manner , produce crops and animal products oriented to national and international markets , rather than to local markets in assessing this complex economic situation , it is important to consider all sources of income available to these farms ; for instance , the millions of dollars in farm subsidies which the united states government offers each year in 1988 mark friedberger warned , '' the farm family is a unique institution , perhaps the last remnant , in an increasingly complex world , of a simpler social order in which economic and domestic activities were inextricably bound together in the past few years , however , american agriculture has suffered huge losses , and family farmers have seen their way of life threatened by economic forces beyond their control '' see mark friedberger , farm families and change in 20th-century america however by 1981 ingolf vogeler argued it was too late -- the american family farm had been replaced by large agribusiness corporations pretending to be family operated several kinds of us family farms are recognized in usda farm typology : small family farms are defined as those with annual gross cash farm income ( gcfi ) of less than 350,000 ; in 2011 , these accounted for 90 percent of all us farms the other small family farm categories are those in which farming occupies at least 50 percent of the principal operator ’ s working time because some but not all partnerships involve family members , these data suggest that family farms account for between about 73 and 97 percent of canadian farms the partners in a canadian farm partnership are typically spouses , often forming the farm partnership for tax reasons also , as in the us , family farm succession planning can use a partnership as a means of apportioning family farm tenure among family members when a sole proprietor is ready to transfer some or all of ownership and operation of a farm to offspring analysis of data for 59,000 farms in the 12 member states of the european community found that in 1989 , about three-quarters of the farms were family farms , producing just over half of total agricultural output analysis by teagasc ( ireland ’ s agriculture and food development authority ) estimates that 37 percent of irish farms are economically viable and an additional 30 percent are sustainable due to income from off-farm sources ; 33 percent meet neither criterion and are considered economically vulnerable '' on commercial family farms , '' cash input costs are high , little non‐family labour is used and strong support services are necessary . international year of family farming
