chondrification ( also known as chondrogenesis ) is the process by which cartilage is formed from condensed mesenchyme tissue , which differentiates into chondroblasts and begins secreting the molecules ( aggrecan and collagen type ii ) that form the extracellular matrix following the initial chondrification that occurs during embryogenesis , cartilage growth consists mostly of the maturing of immature cartilage to a more mature state the division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly , and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself lubricin , a glycoprotein abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid , plays a major role in bio-lubrication and wear protection of cartilage also , because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply , the deposition of new matrix is slow biological engineering techniques are being developed to generate new cartilage , using a cellular '' scaffolding '' material and cultured cells to grow artificial cartilage several diseases can affect cartilage osteoarthritis : osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint , however , one of the most affected tissues is the articular cartilage the cartilage covering bones ( articular cartilageâ€”a subset of hyaline cartilage ) is thinned , eventually completely wearing away , resulting in a '' bone against bone '' within the joint , leading to reduced motion , and pain tumors made up of cartilage tissue , either benign or cancer , can occur they usually appear in bone , rarely in pre-existing cartilage cartilage does not absorb x-rays under normal in vivo conditions , but a dye can be injected into the synovial membrane that will cause the x-rays to be absorbed by the dye for in vitro x-ray scans , the outer soft tissue is most likely removed , so the cartilage and air boundary are enough to contrast the presence of cartilage due to the refraction of the x-ray this is also seen in gill cartilage tissue the chondrocytes present different morphologies related to their position in the tissue the odontophore is a vesicular cell rich cartilage , consisting of vacuolated cells containing myoglobin , surrounded by a low amount of extra cellular matrix containing collagen
