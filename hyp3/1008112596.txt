glass fiber is formed when thin strands of silica-based or other formulation glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing the technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been known for millennia ; however , the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent until this time , all glass fiber had been manufactured as staple ( that is , clusters of short lengths of fiber ) when the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber , they introduced continuous filament glass fibers other types of glass used are a-glass ( alkali-lime glass with little or no boron oxide ) , e-cr-glass ( electrical/chemical resistance ; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , with high acid resistance ) , c-glass ( alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content , used for glass staple fibers and insulation ) , d-glass ( borosilicate glass , named for its low dielectric constant ) , r-glass ( alumino silicate glass without mgo and cao with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement ) , and s-glass ( alumino silicate glass without cao but with high mgo content with high tensile strength ) pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass , but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures e-glass ( '' e '' because of initial electrical application ) , is alkali free , and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation during drawing , the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber , the viscosity must be relatively low however , if it is too low , the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber there are two main types of glass fiber manufacture and two main types of glass fiber product first , fiber is made either from a direct melt process or a marble remelt process both start with the raw materials in solid form the bushing plate is the most important part of the machinery for making the fiber it is heated slightly to keep the glass at the correct temperature for fiber formation in the continuous filament process , after the fiber is drawn , a size is applied while some sizes are processing aids , others make the fiber have an affinity for a certain resin , if the fiber is to be used in a composite however , the safety of glass fiber is also being called into question , as research shows that the composition of this material ( asbestos and glass fiber are both silicate fibers ) can cause similar toxicity as asbestos the north american insulation manufacturers association ( naima ) claims that glass fiber is fundamentally different from asbestos , since it is man-made instead of naturally occurring although both glass fiber and asbestos are made from silica filaments , naima claims that asbestos is more dangerous because of its crystalline structure , which causes it to cleave into smaller , more dangerous pieces , citing the u.s like graphite-reinforced plastic , the composite material is commonly referred to as fiberglass the two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads use of glass-fiber reinforced polymer rebar instead of steel rebar shows promise in areas where avoidance of steel corrosion is desired as sodium based glass fibers assist or replace lithium in lithium-ion batteries due to its improved electronic properties
