radio repeaters are used to retransmit uhf signals when a distance greater than the line of sight is required uhf wavelengths are short enough that efficient transmitting antennas are small enough to mount on handheld and mobile devices , so these frequencies are used for two-way land mobile radio systems , such as walkie-talkies , two way radios in vehicles , and for portable wireless devices ; cordless phones and cell phones today , much of the bandwidth has been reallocated to land mobile , trunked radio and mobile telephone use uhf channels are still used for digital television since at uhf frequencies transmitting antennas are small enough to install on portable devices , the uhf spectrum is used worldwide for land mobile radio systems , two-way radios used for voice communication for commercial , industrial , public safety , and military purposes some wireless computer networks use uhf frequencies uhf cb ( land mobile service ) : 476–477 & nbsp ;
