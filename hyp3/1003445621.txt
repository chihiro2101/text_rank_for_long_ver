gauss 's method was able to use just three observations ( in the form of pairs of right ascension and declination ) , to find the six orbital elements that completely describe an orbit the theory of orbit determination has subsequently been developed to the point where today it is applied in gps receivers as well as the tracking and cataloguing of newly observed minor planets modern orbit determination and prediction are used for operating all types of satellites and space probes , as it is necessary to know their future positions to a high degree of accuracy a line drawn from the planet to the satellite sweeps out equal areas in equal times no matter which portion of the orbit is measured if thrust is applied at only one point in the satellite 's orbit , it will return to that same point on each subsequent orbit , though the rest of its path will change thus one can not move from one circular orbit to another with only one brief application of thrust this will change the shape of its orbit , causing it to gain altitude and actually slow down relative to the leading craft , missing the target for example , simple atmospheric drag is another complicating factor for objects in low earth orbit when the thrust stops , the resulting orbit will be different but will once again be described by kepler 's laws the universal variable formulation works well with the variation of parameters technique , except now , instead of the six keplerian orbital elements , we use a different set of orbital elements : namely , the satellite 's initial position and velocity vectors x_0 and v_0 at a given epoch t 0 in a two-body simulation , these elements are sufficient to compute the satellite 's position and velocity at any time in the future , using the universal variable formulation conversely , at any moment in the satellite 's orbit , we can measure its position and velocity , and then use the universal variable approach to determine what its initial position and velocity would have been at the epoch however , perturbations cause the orbital elements to change over time the following are some effects which make real orbits differ from the simple models based on a spherical earth most of them can be handled on short timescales ( perhaps less than a few thousand orbits ) by perturbation theory because they are small relative to the corresponding two-body effects however , a small fraction of the orbital inclination change can be made at the node near the periapse , by slightly angling the transfer orbit injection thrust in the direction of the desired inclination change this works because the cosine of a small angle is very nearly one , resulting in the small plane change being effectively '' free '' despite the high velocity of the spacecraft near periapse , as the oberth effect due to the increased , slightly angled thrust exceeds the cost of the thrust in the orbit-normal axis in a gravity assist , a spacecraft swings by a planet and leaves in a different direction , at a different speed this effect is that use of a propulsion system works better at high speeds , and hence course changes are best done when close to a gravitating body ; this can multiply the effective delta-v collectively referred to as the interplanetary transport network , these highly perturbative , even chaotic , orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the lagrange point ( in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections )
