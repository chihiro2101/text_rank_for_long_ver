the forkhead box p2 protein is active in the brain and other tissues before and after birth , many studies show that it is paramount for the growth of nerve cells and transmission between them knockout mice with no functional copies of foxp2 are runted , display abnormalities in brain regions such as the purkinje layer , and die an average of 21 days after birth from inadequate lung development foxp2 is expressed in many areas of the brain , including the basal ganglia and inferior frontal cortex , where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development evidence from genetically manipulated mice and human neuronal cell models suggests that these changes affect the neural functions of foxp2 the foxp2 gene has been implicated in several cognitive functions including ; general brain development , language , and synaptic plasticity although some research disagrees with this correlation , the majority of research shows that a mutated foxp2 causes the observed production deficiency there is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the foxp2 gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control brain imaging of affected individuals indicates functional abnormalities in language-related cortical and basal ganglia regions , demonstrating that the problems extend beyond the motor system it is theorized that the translocation of the 7q31.2 region of the foxp2 gene causes a severe language impairment called developmental verbal dyspraxia ( dvd ) or childhood apraxia of speech ( cas ) so far this type of mutation has only been discovered in three families across the world including the original ke family a heterozygous nonsense mutation , r328x variant , produces a truncated protein involved in speech and language difficulties in one ke individual and two of their close family members this is one of the primary reasons that foxp2 is known as a language gene these findings suggest that the effects of foxp2 are not limited to motor control , as they include comprehension among other cognitive language functions insertion of both human mutations into mice , whose version of foxp2 otherwise differs from the human and chimpanzee versions in only one additional base pair , causes changes in vocalizations as well as other behavioral changes , such as a reduction in exploratory tendencies , and a decrease in maze learning time a reduction in dopamine levels and changes in the morphology of certain nerve cells are also observed a study in germany sequenced foxp2 's complementary dna in chimps and other species to compare it with human complementary dna in order to find the specific changes in the sequence since foxp2 was also found to have an effect on other genes , its effects on other genes is also being studied researchers deduced that there could also be further clinical applications in the direction of these studies in regards to illnesses that show effects on human language ability the human variant of foxp2 also had an effect on the exploratory behavior of the mice in comparison to knockout mice with one non-functional copy of foxp2 , the humanized mouse model showed opposite effects when testing its effect on the levels of dopamine , plasticity of synapses , patterns of expression in the striatum and behavior that was exploratory in nature when foxp2 expression was altered in mice , it affected many different processes including the learning motor skills and the plasticity of synapses it was found that its mutations play a role in delaying the development of language learning the negative effects of the mutations of foxp2 in these brain regions on motor abilities were shown in mice through tasks in lab studies differences between song-learning and non-song-learning birds have been shown to be caused by differences in foxp2 gene expression , rather than differences in the amino acid sequence of the foxp2 protein this is one of the few known examples of mendelian ( monogenic ) inheritance for a disorder affecting speech and language skills , which typically have a complex basis involving multiple genetic risk factors around this time , the researchers identified an individual who was unrelated to the ke family but had a similar type of speech and language disorder when the researchers sequenced the foxp2 gene in the ke family , they found a heterozygous point mutation shared by all the affected individuals , but not in unaffected members of the family and other people further screening of the gene identified multiple additional cases of foxp2 disruption , including different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements , providing evidence that damage to one copy of this gene is sufficient to derail speech and language development .
