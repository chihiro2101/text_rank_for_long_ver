the knee is a modified hinge joint , a type of synovial joint , which is composed of three functional compartments : the patellofemoral articulation , consisting of the patella , or '' kneecap '' , and the patellar groove on the front of the femur through which it slides ; and the medial and lateral tibiofemoral articulations linking the femur , or thigh bone , with the tibia , the main bone of the lower leg the resulting series of transverse axes permit the sliding and rolling motion in the flexing knee while ensuring the collateral ligaments are sufficiently lax to permit the rotation associated with the curvature of the medial condyle about a vertical axis the patella also serves an articular body , and its posterior surface is referred to as the trochlea of the knee between these two extensions , the synovial membrane passes in front of the two cruciate ligaments at the center of the joint , thus forming a pocket direct inward two non-communicative bursae are located in front of the patella and below the patellar tendon , and others are sometimes present as a result , new cracks and tears will form in the cartilage over time the ligaments surrounding the knee joint offer stability by limiting movements and , together with the menisci and several bursae , protect the articular capsule the acl is critically important because it prevents the tibia from being pushed too far anterior relative to the femur injury to this ligament is uncommon but can occur as a direct result of forced trauma to the ligament the posterior meniscofemoral ligament is more commonly present ( 30 % ) ; both ligaments are present less often it protects the medial side of the knee from being bent open by a stress applied to the lateral side of the knee ( a valgus force ) lastly , there are two ligaments on the dorsal side of the knee the muscles responsible for the movement of the knee joint belong to either the anterior , medial or posterior compartment of the thigh the knee permits flexion and extension about a virtual transverse axis , as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation about the axis of the lower leg in the flexed position the knee joint is called '' mobile '' because the femur and lateral meniscus move over the tibia during rotation , while the femur rolls and glides over both menisci during extension-flexion during extension , the femoral condyles glide and roll into a position which causes the complete unfolding of the tibial collateral ligament this terminal rotation is made possible by the shape of the medial femoral condyle , assisted by contraction of the popliteus muscle and the iliotibial tract and is caused by the stretching of the anterior cruciate ligament rotation is controlled by the twisted cruciate ligaments ; the two ligaments get twisted around each other during medial rotation of the tibia—which reduces the amount of rotation possible—while they become unwound during lateral rotation of the tibia because of the oblique position of the cruciate ligaments at least a part of one of them is always tense and these ligaments control the joint as the collateral ligaments are relaxed furthermore , the dorsal fibers of the tibial collateral ligament become tensed during extreme medial rotation and the ligament also reduces the lateral rotation to 45–60° one form of patellofemoral syndrome involves a tissue-related problem that creates pressure and irritation in the knee between the patella and the trochlea ( patellar compression syndrome ) , which causes pain the second major class of knee disorder involves a tear , slippage , or dislocation that impairs the structural ability of the knee to balance the leg ( patellofemoral instability syndrome ) prepatellar bursitis also known as housemaid 's knee is painful inflammation of the prepatellar bursa ( a frontal knee bursa ) often brought about by occupational activity such as roofing some of the most common knee injuries are those to the medial side : medial knee injuries minor tears of the anterior cruciate ligament may heal over time , but a torn acl requires surgery the menisci act as shock absorbers and separate the two ends of bone in the knee joint there are two menisci in the knee , the medial ( inner ) and the lateral ( outer ) meniscus tears occur during sports often when the knee is twisted tendons usually attach muscle to bone the injuries to these tendons occur when there is forceful contraction of the knee if the tendon is completely torn , bending or extending the leg is impossible a completely torn tendon requires surgery but a partially torn tendon can be treated with leg immobilization followed by physical therapy there are two disorders relating to an abnormal angle in the coronal plane at the level of the knee : genu valgum is a valgus deformity in which the tibia is turned outward in relation to the femur , resulting in a knock-kneed appearance in birds , the '' knee '' refers to the joints between the femur and tibiotarsus , and also the patella ( when present ) the layman 's term '' knee '' may also refer to the ( lower and often more visible due to not being covered by feathers ) joint between the tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus , which is homologous to the human ankle
