it contains information about who originated the alert ( the president , state or local authorities , the national weather service ( noaa/nws ) , or the broadcaster ) , a short , general description of the event ( tornado , flood , severe thunderstorm ) , the areas affected ( up to 32 counties or states ) , the expected duration of the event ( in minutes ) , the date and time it was issued ( in utc ) , and an identification of the originating station ( see same for a complete breakdown of the header ) the national public warning system , also known as the primary entry point ( pep ) stations , are a network of 77 radio stations that are , in coordination with fema , used to originate emergency alert and warning information to the public before , during , and after incidents and disasters the fema national radio system ( fnars ) '' provides primary entry point service to the emergency alert system '' , and acts as an emergency presidential link into the eas the decoder then decides whether to ignore the message or to relay it on the air if the message applies to the local area served by the station ( following parameters set by the broadcaster ) under an fcc report and order issued in 2007 , eas participants would be required to migrate to digital equipment supporting cap within 180 days of the specification 's adoption by fema for reliability , at least two source stations must be monitored , one of which must be a designated local primary though an rwt does not need an audio or graphic message announcing the test , many stations provide them as a courtesy to the public required monthly tests ( rmts ) are generally originated by the local or state primary station , a state emergency management agency , or by the national weather service and are then relayed by broadcast stations and cable channels no testing has to be done during a calendar week in which all parts of the eas ( header burst , attention signal , audio message , and end of message burst ) have been legitimately activated in july 2018 , in response to the aftermath of the false missile alert in hawaii earlier in the year ( which was caused by operator error during an internal drill protocol ) , the fcc announced that it would take steps to promote public awareness and improve efficiency of the system , including requiring safeguards to prevent distribution of false alarms , the ability to authorize '' live code '' tests—which would simulate the process and response to an actual emergency , and authorizations to use the eas tones in public service announcements that promote awareness of the system the fcc found that only half of participants received the message via ipaws , and some '' failed to receive or retransmit alerts due to erroneous equipment configuration , equipment readiness and upkeep issues , and confusion regarding eas rules and technical requirements '' , and that participation among low-power broadcasters was low to reduce viewer confusion , the fcc stated that future national tests would be delivered under the new event code '' national periodic test '' ( '' npt '' ) , and list '' united states '' as its location the test focused exclusively on distribution to broadcast outlets and television providers via the primary entry point network , in order to gauge the efficiency of alert distribution in the event that the internet can not be used in 2018 , hawaii senator brian schatz proposed the reliable emergency alert distribution improvement ( readi ) act ; alongside proposing that fema create best practices for eas usage and false alarms ( the latter in response to the hawaii false missile alert ) , it would have required that certain types of alerts receive repeat broadcasts in order to ensure that viewers receive the alert these radios come pre-tuned to a station in each area that has agreed to provide this service to local emergency management officials and agencies , often with a direct link back to the plant 's safety system or control room for instant activation should an evacuation or other emergency arise the eas can only be used to relay audio messages that preempt all programming ; as the intent of an emergency action notification is to serve as a '' last-ditch effort to get a message out if the president can not get to the media '' , it can easily be made redundant by the 24-hour news cycle that major weather events and other newsworthy situations—such as , most prominently , the september 11 attacks in 2001—receive from television broadcasters and news channels glenn collins of the new york times acknowledged these limitations , noting that '' no president has ever used the current eas system or its technical predecessors in the last 50 years , despite the cold war , a presidential assassination , the oklahoma city bombing , major earthquakes and three recent high-alert terrorist warnings '' , and that using it would have actually hindered the availability of live coverage from media outlets following the tornado outbreak of march 3 , 2019 , birmingham , alabama nws meteorologist kevin laws told cnn that he , personally , wished that alerts could be updated in real-time in order to reflect the unpredictable nature of weather events –noting that the storm system 's unexpected change in trajectory towards lee county resulted in only a nine-minute warning ( the resulting tornado would kill 23 people ) the trend of cord cutting has led to concerns that viewers ' lessened use of broadcast media in favor of over-the-top content would inhibit their ability to receive emergency information ( notwithstanding wireless emergency alerts ) a study conducted following the incident reported that at least 11 % of residents actually saw the warning live , and that 63 % of those surveyed were '' a little or not at all concerned '' —citing a suspicious lack of detail in the message , which a legitimate alert would include cdt , an emergency action notification was accidentally issued in the state of illinois , when a new satellite receiver at the state 's eoc was accidentally connected to a live system before final internal testing of the new delivery path had been completed the message transmitted was for a severe thunderstorm warning , issued by the national weather service in pendleton , but the transmission broadcast instead was a long period of silence , followed by a few words in spanish officials cited an error in the county 's code red system ; while the correct message was entered into the system , an error processing an abbreviated message for television resulted in the error local time , guam stations ktwg and ksto transmitted a civil danger warning for the island ; guam homeland security described the message , which interrupted programming on the stations , and was received on television by some viewers , as being an '' unauthorized test '' of the eas numerous calls to 911 operators and the department of homeland security were made following the broadcast in january 2020 , security ledger published an investigation finding that at least 50 eas decoders by digital alert systems had not been patched for a security vulnerability ( use of a shared ssh key ) found by ioactive in 2013 to protect the integrity of the system , and prevent false activations , the fcc prohibits the use of actual or simulated eas/wea tones and attention signals outside of genuine alerts , tests , or authorized public service announcements , especially when they are used '' to capture audience attention during advertisements ; dramatic , entertainment , and educational programs '' the ad aired four times before station compliance authorities pulled the advertisement after the local news industry blog ftvlive criticized the station for carrying it , especially during the peak of the atlantic hurricane season the fcc issued several fines relating to eas tone usage in august 2019 , including abc being fined 395,000 for using wireless emergency alert tones multiple times during a jimmy kimmel live sketch , amc networks being fined 104,000 for using the tones in the walking dead episode '' omega '' , discovery inc on april 7 , 2020 , the fcc proposed a 20,000 fine against new york city radio station wnew-fm , for using the attention signal during its morning show on october 3 , 2018 as part of a skit discussing the national periodic test held later that day on september 21 , 2017 , a technical glitch in another scheduled test by kwve caused the end-of-message tone to be omitted , causing regional participants ( particularly charter and cox cable systems in orange county ) to simulcast a portion of chuck swindoll 's insight for living program alert ready ( canada ) digital emergency alert system ( deas ) earthquake early warning ( japan ) emergency population warning emergency public warning system flash flood guidance systems handel ( uk 's former national attack warning system ) icann 's teac ( transfer emergency action contact ) channel in cases of domain hijack j-alert local access alert national severe weather warning service national warning system noaa weather radio nuclear football nuclear masint radio amateur civil emergency service specific area message encoding standard emergency warning signal ( australia ) wartime broadcasting service weatheradio canada wireless emergency alerts ( wea )
