the word cultivar originated from the need to distinguish between wild plants and those with characteristics that arose in cultivation , presently denominated cultigens i now propose another name , cultivar , for a botanical variety , or for a race subordinate to species , that has originated under cultivation ; it is not necessarily , however , referable to a recognized botanical species it is essentially the equivalent of the botanical variety except in respect to its origin in that essay , bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen , but it was obvious to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species , and that realization appears to have motivated the suggestion of the new category of cultivar the first cultivated plant code of 1953 subsequently commended its use , and by 1960 it had achieved common international acceptance 2.3 cultigens can have names at any of many taxonomic ranks , including those of grex , species , cultivar group , variety , form , and cultivar ; and they may be plants that have been altered in cultivation , including by genetic modification , but have not been formally denominated the cultivated plant code notes that the word cultivar is used in two different senses : first , as a '' classification category '' the cultivar is defined in article 2 of the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants ( 2009 , 8th edition ) as follows : the basic category of cultivated plants whose nomenclature is governed by this code is the cultivar image : airport orchid.jpg thumb left 220px a cultivar of the orchid genus oncidium which plants are chosen to be named as cultivars is simply a matter of convenience as the category was created to serve the practical needs of horticulture , agriculture , and forestry the cultivated plant code emphasizes that different cultivated plants may be accepted as different cultivars , even if they have the same genome , while cultivated plants with different genomes may be regarded as the same cultivar plants whose distinctive characters are derived from the presence of an intracellular organism may also form a cultivar provided the characters are reproduced reliably from generation to generation cultivated plant code , articles 2.17–2.18 occasionally cultivars are raised from seed of a specially selected provenance – for example the seed may be taken from plants that are resistant to a particular disease however , the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants notes , '' in practice such an assemblage is often marketed from one or more lines or multilines that have been genetically modified '' cultivated plant code , articles 2.19 however , retired transgenic varieties such as the fish tomato , which are no longer being developed , do not run into this obstacle and can be given a cultivar name in addition , cultivars may be associated with commercial marketing names referred to in the cultivated plant code as '' trade designations '' ( see below ) cultivated plant code article 21.3 it is permissible to place a cultivar epithet after a common name provided the common name is botanically unambiguous '' has not been permitted by the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants since the 1995 edition it is still widely used and recommended by other authorities as group names are used with cultivar names it is necessary to understand their way of presentation since the 1990s there has been an increasing use of legal protection for newly produced cultivars marketing names lie outside the scope of the cultivated plant code which refers to them as '' trade designations '' plants protected by plant breeders ' rights ( pbr ) may have a '' true '' cultivar name – the recognized scientific name in the public domain – and a '' commercial synonym '' – an additional marketing name that is legally protected quoting the original cultivar name allows the correct identification of cultivars around the world one major aim is to prevent the duplication of cultivar and group epithets within a genus , as well as ensuring that names are in accord with the latest edition of the cultivated plant code in recent times many icras have also recorded trade designations and trademarks used in labelling plant material , to avoid confusion with established names they record details about the plant , such as parentage , the names of those concerned with its development and introduction , and a basic description highlighting its distinctive characters
