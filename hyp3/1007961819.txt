from hellenistic times , mention of a second divine figure , either beside yhwh or beneath him , occur in a number of jewish texts , mostly apocryphal alan segal , two powers in heaven : early rabbinic reports about christianity and gnosticism , brill 2002 pp.60ff ultimately these ideas appear to go back to differing interpretations of the heavenly enthronement passages at book of exodus , daniel 7:9f many scholars believe that the final chapters in the book of parables are a later addition parts of the text in daniel are aramaic and may have been changed in translation the septuagint reads that the son of man came as the ancient of days the identification of metatron with the gnostic 3 & nbsp ; enoch , where the name first appears , is not explicitly made in the talmud although it does refer to a prince of the world who was young but now is old however , some of the earliest kabbalah assumed the connection furthermore , the merkabah text re ' uyot yehezkel identifies the ancient of days from the book of daniel as metatron many scholars see a discontinuity between how enoch is portrayed in the early enoch literature and how metatron is portrayed scholars commonly see the character of metatron as being based on an amalgam of jewish literature , in addition to enoch , michael , melchizedek , and jehoel among others are seen as influences scholem argues that this second tradition was originally separate but later became fused with the enoch tradition this raises a problem since the name metatron does not seem to be directly related to the name of god yhwh elishah ben abuyah therefore looks to metatron as a deity and says heretically : '' there are indeed two powers in heaven ! '' hagigah 15a the rabbis explain that metatron had permission to sit because of his function as the heavenly scribe , writing down the deeds of israel extra-talmudic mystical texts such as sefer hekhalot do speak of a '' lesser yhwh '' , apparently deriving the concept from exodus 23:21 , which mentions an angel of whom god says '' my name understood as yhvh , the usual divine proper name is in him '' called me , 'the lesser yhvh ' in the presence of his whole household in the height , as it is written , 'my name is in him . metatron '' the youth '' , a title previously used in 3 enoch , where it appears to mean '' servant '' zohar commentaries such as the '' ohr yakar '' by moses ben jacob cordovero explain the zohar as meaning that metaron as the head of yetzira this corresponds closely with maimonides ' description of the talmudic '' prince of the world '' , traditionally associated with metatron , as the core '' active intellect the zohar finds the word '' youth '' used to describe joseph and joshua a hint that the figures are a metaphor to metatron , and also the concept of '' servant '' by eliezer as a reference to metatron 32 the name itself is attested early in islam by al-kindi and al-masudi 193 he is also frequently mentioned in the magical works by ahmad al-buni , who describes metatron as wearing a crown and a lance , probably constituting the staff of moses orlov , the enoch-metatron tradition ( tsaj , 107 ; tuebingen : mohr-siebeck , 2005 ) 92-97 however , some scholars , such as philip alexander , believe if the name metatron originated in hekhalot-merkabah texts ( such as 3 enoch ) , then it may be a magic word like adiriron and dapdapiron odeberg also suggests that the name metatron might be taken from the old persian name mithra the word ( synthronos ) is used as '' co-occupant of the divine throne '' ; sunthronos , the greek term metaturannos , which can be translated as '' the one next to the ruler '' philip alexander also suggests this as a possible origin of metatron , stating that the word metator also occurs in greek as mitatorâ€“a word for an officer in the roman army who acted as a forerunner using this etymology , alexander suggests the name may have come about as a description of '' the angel of the lord who led the israelites through the wilderness : acting like a roman army metator guiding the israelites on their way '' because we see this as a word in hebrew , jewish aramaic , and greek , alexander believes this gives even more strength to this etymology charles mopsik believes that the name metatron may be related to the sentence from genesis 5:24 '' enoch walked with god , then he was no more , because god took him ( ron ) is a standard addition to ( metatron ) and other angelic names in the jewish faith in the entry entitled '' paradigmata '' in his study , '' 'the written ' as the vocation of conceiving jewishly '' , john w mcginley gives an accounting of how this name functions in the bavli 's version of '' four entered pardes '' this hypothesis explains why the generators of the '' chambers '' portion of the heikhalot literature make '' ishmael ben elisha '' the major protagonist of their writings even though this rabbi ishmael was not directly mentioned in the bavli 's account ( in the gemara to tractate khaggigah ) of '' the work of the chariot '' solomon judah loeb rapoport in igrot shir suggests that metatron is a combination of two greek words which mean to '' change '' and '' pass away '' referring to chanoch ( enoch ) who '' changed '' into an angel and '' passed away '' from the world
