the rider attempts to stay on the horse for eight seconds without touching the horse with their free hand this means they must have the heels of their boots in contact with the horse above the point of the shoulders before the horse 's front legs hit the ground in some cases , the rider simply held onto the horse 's mane , called a mane-hold others held a loose or twisted rope tied around the horse 's girth , and other methods involved using multiple handhold leather riggings based on a surcingle in the early 1920s , when the old rodeo rules allowing two handed riding were being phased out and replaced with the newer rule of riding with one hand in the rigging and one hand in the air , earl bascom invented , designed and made rodeo 's first one-hand bareback rigging because bucking horses usually travel in close quarters and are housed in a herd setting , geldings are generally less disruptive and more prone to get along with one another however , mares are also used , and while a mixed herd of mares and geldings is a bit more prone to disruptions , they can be kept together without great difficulties due to the rigors of travel and the short bursts of high intensity work required , most horses in a bucking string are at least 6 or 7 years old basic injuries occurred at a rate of 0.072 percent , or one in 1,405 , with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036 percent , or one injury in every 2810 times the animal was used , and transport , yarding and competition were all included in the study bucking horses and bulls are costly to replace : a proven bucking horse can be sold for 8000 to 10,000 , making '' rough stock '' an investment worth caring for and keeping in good health for many years an injured animal will not buck well and hence a cowboy can not obtain a high score for his ride , so sick or injured animals are not run through the chutes , but instead are given appropriate veterinary care so they can be returned to their usual level of strength and power activists also express concern that many rodeo horses end their lives as horsemeat while it is accurate that some rough stock animals are slaughtered for horsemeat at the end of their useful careers , other bucking horses are retired at the end of their rodeo usefulness and allowed to live into old age flank straps that hurt the horse are not allowed by rodeo rules in the united states however , while the implied argument behind this claim is that pain is what makes the horse buck , in actual practice , irritants or pain generally interfere with a horse 's ability to buck in an energetic and athletic fashion
