evidence from ancient egypt shows that the early egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull as early as 3100 & nbsp ; bc egyptian pottery as old as 4000 bc shows designs of early boats or other means for navigation shipwrecks of austronesian ships can be identified from this construction , as well as the absence of metal nails in island southeast asia , these developed into double outriggers on each side that provided greater stability early contact with arab ships in the indian ocean during austronesian voyages is also believed to have resulted in the development of the triangular arabic lateen sail native labourers may have manufactured the flotilla of boats used by alexander the great to navigate across the hydaspes and even the indus , under nearchos the ships of ancient egypt 's eighteenth dynasty were typically about 25 & nbsp ; meters ( 80 & nbsp ; ft ) in length , and had a single mast , sometimes consisting of two poles lashed together at the top making an '' a '' shape the ocean and sea going ships of ancient egypt were constructed with cedar wood , most likely hailing from lebanon the ancient china also built ramming vessels as in the greco-roman tradition of the trireme , although oar-steered ships in china lost favor very early on since it was in the 1st century china that the stern-mounted rudder was first developed it is thought that the chinese had adopted the malay junk sail by this period , although a unesco study argues that the chinese were using square sails during the han dynasty and adopted the malay junk sail later , in the 12th century the malay and javanese people , started building large djong ( ship ) about 1st century ad this type of ship was favored by chinese travelers , because they did not build seaworthy ships until around 8–9th century ad carvel construction in western europe ( see map an insight into ship building in the north sea/baltic areas of the early medieval period was found at sutton hoo , england , where a ship was buried with a chieftain sometime around the 12th century , northern european ships began to be built with a straight sternpost , enabling the mounting of a rudder , which was much more durable than a steering oar held over the side the mainstay of china 's merchant and naval fleets was the junk , which had existed for centuries , but it was at this time that the large ships based on this design were built during the sung period ( 960–1279 ad ) , the establishment of china 's first official standing navy in 1132 ad and the enormous increase in maritime trade abroad ( from heian japan to fatimid egypt ) allowed the shipbuilding industry in provinces like fujian to thrive as never before large numbers of ships were built to meet the demand however , in recent years , some researchers agree that the treasure ships were more of the fuchuan type shipbuilding was not the sole industry utilising chinese lumber at that time ; the new capital was being built in beijing from approximately 1407 onwards , which required huge amounts of high-quality wood these two ambitious projects commissioned by emperor yongle would have had enormous environmental and economic effects , even if the ships were half the dimensions given in the history of ming considerable pressure would also have been placed on the infrastructure required to transport the trees from their point of origin to the shipyards it was a critical invention in shipbuilding technique in ancient china and was only used by the chinese for a fairly long time during this period , chinese navigation technology did not make any progress and even declined in some aspect others refer to guinea coast peoples using war canoes of varying sizes – some 70 feet in length , 7–8 & nbsp ; feet broad , with sharp pointed ends , rowing benches on the side , and quarter decks or focastles build of reeds with the development of the carrack , the west moved into a new era of ship construction by building the first regular oceangoing vessels even so , construction techniques changed only very gradually the ships of the napoleonic wars were still built more or less to the same basic plan as those of the spanish armada of two centuries earlier but there had been numerous subtle improvements in ship design and construction throughout this period though still largely based on pre-industrial era materials and designs , ships greatly improved during the early industrial revolution period ( 1760 to 1825 ) , as '' the risk of being wrecked for atlantic shipping fell by one third , and of foundering by two thirds , reflecting improvements in seaworthiness and navigation respectively '' the improvements in seaworthiness have been credited to '' replacing the traditional stepped deck ship with stronger flushed decked ones derived from indian designs , and the increasing use of iron reinforcement '' the design originated from bengal rice ships , with bengal being famous for its shipbuilding industry at the time iron was gradually adopted in ship construction , initially to provide stronger joints in a wooden hull e.g one study finds that there were considerable improvements in ship speed from 1750 to 1850 : '' we find that average sailing speeds of british ships in moderate to strong winds rose by nearly a third despite her success , and the great savings in cost and space provided by the iron hull , compared to a copper sheathed counterpart , there remained problems with fouling due to the adherence of weeds and barnacles as a result , composite construction remained the dominant approach where fast ships were required , with wooden timbers laid over an iron frame ( cutty sark is a famous example ) steel also supplanted wrought iron when it became readily available in the latter half of the 19th century , providing great savings when compared with iron in cost and weight during world war ii , the need for cargo ships was so great that construction time for liberty ships went from initially eight months or longer , down to weeks or even days the total number of dry-cargo ships built in the united states in a 15-year period just before the war was a grand total of two and , they were built by a workforce consisting largely of women and other inexperienced workers who had never seen a ship before ( or even the ocean ) the liberty ships : the history of the '' emergency '' type cargo ships constructed in the united states during the second world war , pp after the second world war , shipbuilding ( which encompasses the shipyards , the marine equipment manufacturers , and many related service and knowledge providers ) grew as an important and strategic industry in a number of countries around the world this importance stems from : the large number of skilled workers required directly by the shipyard , along with supporting industries such as steel mills , railroads and engine manufacturers ; and a nation 's need to manufacture and repair its own navy and vessels that support its primary industries historically , the industry has suffered from the absence of global rules and a tendency towards ( state-subsidy ) over-investment due to the fact that shipyards offer a wide range of technologies , employ a significant number of workers , and generate income as the shipbuilding market is global japan used shipbuilding in the 1950s and 1960s to rebuild its industrial structure ; south korea started to make shipbuilding a strategic industry in the 1970s , and china is now in the process of repeating these models with large state-supported investments in this industry in the early 1970s british yards still had the capacity to build all types and sizes of merchant ships but today they have been reduced to a small number specialising in defence contracts , luxury yachts and repair work the consequence of this is that contract prices are far higher than those of any other country building oceangoing ships the market share of european ship builders began to decline in the 1960s as they lost work to japan in the same way japan most recently lost their work to china and south korea ship design work , also called naval architecture , may be conducted using a ship model basin however , since the early 1970s computer-aided design became normal for the shipbuilding design and lofting process modern ships , since roughly 1940 , have been produced almost exclusively of welded steel although it is commonly accepted that modern steel has eliminated brittle fracture in ships , some controversy still exists all ships need repair work at some point in their working lives however , a large number of repair and maintenance works can only be carried out while the ship is out of commercial operation , in a ship repair yard shipyard construction records shipyards united states—from globalsecurity.org shipbuilding news bataviawerf – the historic dutch east indiaman ship yard—shipyard of the historic ships batavia and zeven provincien in the netherlands , since 1985 here have been great ships reconstructed using old construction methods
