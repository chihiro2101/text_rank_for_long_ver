given the accepted concave utility function , the capm is consistent with intuition—investors ( should ) require a higher return for holding a more risky asset market risk , the market as a whole , by definition , has a beta of one stock market indices are frequently used as local proxies for the market—and in that case ( by definition ) have a beta of one unsystematic risk can be diversified away to smaller levels by including a greater number of assets in the portfolio ( specific risks '' average out '' ) depending on the market , a portfolio of approximately 30–40 securities in developed markets such as the uk or us will render the portfolio sufficiently diversified such that risk exposure is limited to systematic risk only in developing markets a larger number is required , due to the higher asset volatilities a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk , as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model in other words , the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor the traditional capm using historical data as the inputs to solve for a future return of asset i however , the history may not be sufficient to use for predicting the future and modern capm approaches have used betas that rely on future risk estimates this would be implied by the assumption that returns are normally distributed , or indeed are distributed in any two-parameter way , but for general return distributions other risk measures ( like coherent risk measures ) will reflect the active and potential shareholders ' preferences more adequately indeed , risk in financial investments is not variance in itself , rather it is the probability of losing : it is asymmetric in nature barclays wealth have published some research on asset allocation with non-normal returns which shows that investors with very low risk tolerances should hold more cash than capm suggests the model assumes that all active and potential shareholders have access to the same information and agree about the risk and expected return of all assets ( homogeneous expectations assumption ) empirical studies show that low beta stocks may offer higher returns than the model would predict the model assumes that given a certain expected return , active and potential shareholders will prefer lower risk ( lower variance ) to higher risk and conversely given a certain level of risk will prefer higher returns to lower ones this assumes no preference between markets and assets for individual active and potential shareholders , and that active and potential shareholders choose assets solely as a function of their risk-return profile ) in practice , such a market portfolio is unobservable and people usually substitute a stock index as a proxy for the true market portfolio the model assumes economic agents optimise over a short-term horizon , and in fact investors with longer-term outlooks would optimally choose long-term inflation-linked bonds instead of short-term rates as this would be more risk-free asset to such an agent capm assumes that all active and potential shareholders will consider all of their assets and optimize one portfolio this is in sharp contradiction with portfolios that are held by individual shareholders : humans tend to have fragmented portfolios or , rather , multiple portfolios : for each goal one portfolio — see behavioral portfolio theory and maslowian portfolio theory
