blücher knew that marmont 's corps was weak and his plan was to destroy it and thus fall upon the rear of napoleon 's main force still in pursuit of the debris of the enemy force , late on 13 february , napoleon received reports that marmont 's corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at étoges the emperor left château-thierry on 14 february , towards 3 o'clock in the morning , leaving a small portion of his forces with marshal édouard mortier , duc de trévise , with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy meanwhile , late on 13 february , having successfully regrouped what forces he could muster at bergères-lès-vertus , blücher had launched an attack against marmont 's single division , pushing him out of étoges and advancing as planned towards champaubert and fromentières , in the rear of napoleon 's force napoleon had sent orders for a major concentration of forces , which resulted in a force of some 25,000 men being assembled in this sector of these forces , only the cavalry , marmont 's infantry and one battalion of the old guard were actually engaged in the fighting having begun to push back the feeble french forces from marmont 's vi 's corps the day before , blücher occupied champaubert early on 14 february , sending his vanguard forward , as far as the village of fromentières and then vauchamps marshal marmont then launched his five squadrons to the rescue and the cavalry promptly forced the prussians back to the village , with one of their battalions taken prisoner , after taking refuge in an isolated farm marmont was now supported on his left by general grouchy , who had just arrived on the field of battle with the divisions of saint-germain and doumerc , moving past the village of janvilliers , in order to cut off zieten 's retreat with the french imperial guard artillery now also deployed and firing at them , zieten 's prussians drew back in good order , and formed in squares to fend off grouchy 's cavalry with the coalition forces now in full retreat , marmont received orders to aggressively pursue the enemy , knowing that he could count on his two infantry divisions , plus that of leval , as well as on the support of general drouot 's guard artillery , on nansouty 's guard cavalry on his right and on grouchy 's two cavalry divisions on his left napoleon was followed by an additional '' young guard '' division , under general meunier , which the emperor had taken with him when he left château-thierry early that morning zieten 's brigade was finally cut off from the rest of the army and charged violently by grouchy 's cuirassiers , who broke the infantry squares and took no less than 2,000 prisoners , with the rest of the brigade routed only just escaping capture , blücher crossed the forest of vertus and took up positions at étoges with prince urusov 's division , which had been left there in reserve prince urusov , 600 men and eight artillery pieces were captured during this action , with the french sailors ' regiment from lagrange 's division subsequently entering the village of étoges the battle was actually no more than a very long cavalry pursuit and was a very costly defeat for blücher 's '' army of silesia '' , which lost as much as 10,000 men , during this day
