however , except for instruments that accommodate extensive string pulling , like the sitar , much less influence on intonation is possible than on unfretted instruments to compensate for the increase in string tension when the string is pressed against the frets , the bridge position is adjusted slightly so the 12th fret plays exactly in tune scalloped fretboards have not found widespread popularity because tonally accurate play requires a much lighter fretting hand than most guitarists can achieve , and often significantly heavier strings as well semi-fretted versions of guitars and other fretted string instruments , however , are usually one-off , custom adaptations made for players who want to combine elements of both types of sound one arrangement is for the frets to extend only part of the way along the neck so that the higher notes can be played with the smooth expression possible with a fretless fingerboard another approach is the use of frets that extend only partway across the fretboard so that some courses of strings are fretted and others fretless , for example ryszard latecki 's latar every time a string is fretted it is also stretched , and as it stretches the string rises in pitch , making all fretted tones sound sharp as a result , when the tension of the strings is lowered , the pitches of all notes , both fretted and unfretted , becomes correct fret buzz occurs when the vibrating part of one or more strings physically strikes the frets that are higher than the fretted note ( or open note ) fret buzz can be caused by different things : low action improperly installed frets strings too loose improper relief of guitar neck fret buzz is evident in some famous recordings ; an example is '' friends '' by led zeppelin ( although this example is undoubtedly caused by alternate open tunings that reduce string tension ) in some songs , such as '' my last serenade '' by killswitch engage , the guitars are tuned to dropped c and the low tension of the strings is used to create fret buzz by the bass player in order to create a dirty sound
