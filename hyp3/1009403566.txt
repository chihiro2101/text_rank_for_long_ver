oxford dictionary of biography , '' francis hutcheson '' by james moore , retrieved 9 august 2013 while living in dublin , hutcheson published anonymously the four essays for which he is best known : in 1725 inquiry concerning beauty , order , harmony and design , and inquiry concerning moral good and evil , which together comprise his inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue ; ulster history circle retrieved 2012-05-17 an inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue : in two treatises 1.concerning beauty , order , harmony , design 2.concerning moral good and evil j '' the order of topics discussed in the economic portion of hutcheson ’ s system of moral philosophy , 1755 is repeated by smith in his glasgow lectures and again in the wealth of nations '' however , it was likely something other than hutcheson 's written work that had such a great influence on smith unlike smith , hutcheson was not a system builder ; rather , it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as '' the never to be forgotten hutcheson '' , a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people , his good friend david hume and influential mentor , hutcheson his importance is , however , due almost entirely to his ethical writings , and among these primarily to the four essays and the letters published during his time in dublin his standpoint has a negative and a positive aspect ; he is in strong opposition to thomas hobbes and mandeville , and in fundamental agreement with shaftesbury , whose name he very properly coupled with his own on the title page of the first two essays obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two authors include the analogy drawn between beauty and virtue , the functions assigned to the moral sense , the position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of our nature , and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare according to hutcheson , man has a variety of senses , internal as well as external , reflex as well as direct , the general definition of a sense being '' any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will , and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain '' ( essay on the nature and conduct of the passions , sect it is plain , as the author confesses , that there may be '' other perceptions , distinct from all these classes , '' and , in fact , there seems to be no limit to the number of '' senses '' in which a psychological division of this kind might result '' his principal design , '' he says in the preface to the two first treatises , '' is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue , to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions , and accordingly to regulate its conduct '' passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage , as well as the assumption that the '' moral sense '' has had no growth or history , but was '' implanted '' in man exactly as found among the more civilized races ( an assumption common to both hutcheson and butler ) , his use of the term '' sense '' tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement for , as established by hume , this act consists of two parts : an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement ; and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good , and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad by the intellectual part of this process , we refer the action or habit to a certain class ; but no sooner is the intellectual process complete than there is excited in us a feeling similar to what myriads of actions and habits of ( apparently ) the same class excited in us on former occasions the term '' moral sense '' ( which , it may be noticed , had already been employed by shaftesbury , not only , as william whewell suggests , in the margin , but also in the text of his inquiry ) , if invariably coupled with the term '' moral judgement , '' would be open to little objection ; but , taken alone , as designating the complex process of moral approbation , it is liable to lead not only to serious misapprehension but to grave practical errors but though hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately , he does not , like butler , conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard this consideration could hardly escape any author , however wedded to his own system , and hutcheson attempts to extricate himself from the difficulty by laying down the position that a man may justly regard himself as a part of the rational system , and may thus be , in part , an object of his own benevolence ( ibid ) , a curious abuse of terms , which really concedes the question at issue this is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by hobbes and locke ( to the latter of whom hutcheson refers in a note ) , namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind , and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will , not the liberty of willing as we will butler 's sermons appeared in 1726 , the year after the publication of hutcheson 's two first essays , and there are parallels between the '' conscience '' of the one writer and the '' moral sense '' of the other all the main outlines of locke 's philosophy seem , at first sight , to be accepted as a matter of course it is , however , a most important modification of locke 's doctrine , and connects hutcheson 's mental philosophy with that of reid , when he states that the ideas of extension , figure , motion and rest '' are more properly ideas accompanying the sensations of sight and touch than the sensations of either of these senses '' ; that the idea of self accompanies every thought , and that the ideas of number , duration and existence accompany every other idea whatsoever ( see essay on the nature and conduct of the passions , sect other important points in which hutcheson follows the lead of locke are his depreciation of the importance of the so-called laws of thought , his distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of bodies , the position that we can not know the inmost essences of things ( '' intimae rerum naturae sive essentiae '' ) , though they excite various ideas in us , and the assumption that external things are known only through the medium of ideas ( syn amongst the more important points in which hutcheson diverges from locke is his account of the idea of personal identity , which he appears to have regarded as made known to us directly by consciousness generally , he speaks as if we had a direct consciousness of mind as distinct from body , though , in the posthumous work on moral philosophy , he expressly states that we know mind as we know body '' by qualities immediately perceived though the substance of both be unknown ( bk the distinction between perception proper and sensation proper , which occurs by implication though it is not explicitly worked out ( see hamilton 's lectures on metaphysics , – lect ) and the disposition to refer on disputed questions of philosophy not so much to formal arguments as to the testimony of consciousness and our natural instincts are also amongst the points in which hutcheson supplemented or departed from the philosophy of locke thus , in estimating hutcheson 's position , we find that in particular questions he stands nearer to locke , but in the general spirit of his philosophy he seems to approach more closely to his scottish successors the latter reason leads him to call attention to the beauty perceived in universal truths , in the operations of general causes and in moral principles and actions but to the student of mental philosophy it may be specially interesting to remark that hutcheson both applies the principle of association to explain our ideas of beauty and also sets limits to its application , insisting on there being '' a natural power of perception or sense of beauty in objects , antecedent to all custom , education or example '' ( see inquiry , etc to say nothing of minor opponents , such as '' philaretus '' ( gilbert burnet , already alluded to ) , dr john balguy ( 1686–1748 ) , prebendary of salisbury , the author of two tracts on '' the foundation of moral goodness '' , and dr john taylor ( 1694–1761 ) of norwich , a minister of considerable reputation in his time ( author of an examination of the scheme of amorality advanced by dr hutcheson ) , the essays appear to have suggested , by antagonism , at least two works that hold a permanent place in the literature of english ethics—butler 's dissertation on the nature of virtue , and richard price 's treatise of moral good and evil ( 1757 ) in this latter work the author maintains , in opposition to hutcheson , that actions are – in themselves right or wrong , that right and wrong are simple ideas incapable of analysis , and that these ideas are perceived immediately by the understanding we thus see that , not only directly but also through the replies that it called forth , the system of hutcheson , or at least the system of hutcheson combined with that of shaftesbury , contributed , in large measure , to the formation and development of some of the most important of the modern schools of ethics hutcheson 's early inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue , introducing his perennial association of '' unalienable rights '' with the collective right to resist oppressive government , was used at harvard college as a textbook as early as the 1730s
