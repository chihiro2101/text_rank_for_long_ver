( slide rules used to number among the supplies , too , but nowadays even manual drafting , when it occurs , benefits from a pocket calculator or its onscreen equivalent the classic reproduction methods involved blue and white appearances ( whether blueprint or whiteprint ) , which is why engineering drawings were long called , and even today are still often called , '' blueprints '' or '' bluelines '' , even though those terms are anachronism from a literal perspective , since most copies of engineering drawings today are made by more modern methods ( often inkjet or laser printing ) that yield black or multicolour lines on white paper almost all engineering drawings ( except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches ) communicate not only geometry ( shape and location ) but also dimensions and tolerances for those characteristics drawings convey the following critical information : geometry – the shape of the object ; represented as views ; how the object will look when it is viewed from various angles , such as front , top , side , etc types of lines include the following : visible – are continuous lines used to depict edges directly visible from a particular angle hidden – are short-dashed lines that may be used to represent edges that are not directly visible center – are alternately long- and short-dashed lines that may be used to represent the axes of circular features cutting plane – are thin , medium-dashed lines , or thick alternately long- and double short-dashed that may be used to define sections for section views section – are thin lines in a pattern ( pattern determined by the material being '' cut '' or '' sectioned '' ) used to indicate surfaces in section views resulting from '' cutting '' phantom – ( not shown ) are alternately long- and double short-dashed thin lines used to represent a feature or component that is not part of the specified part or assembly type a lines show the outline of the feature of an object type c lines are used for breaks when the whole object is not shown 2h pencil type k lines indicate the alternate positions of an object and the line taken by that object in most cases , a single view is not sufficient to show all necessary features , and several views are used the primary views ) , and is typically positioned relative to each other according to the rules of either multiview projection as shown above , the determination of what surface constitutes the front , back , top , and bottom varies depending on the projection method used but any combination of views may be used depending on the needs of the particular design using the auxiliary view allows for that inclined plane ( and any other significant features ) to be projected in their true size and shape the true size and shape of any feature in an engineering drawing can only be known when the line of sight ( los ) is perpendicular to the plane being referenced auxiliary views tend to make use of axonometric projection the two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are drawn : smaller as their distance from the observer increases foreshortened : the size of an object 's dimensions along the line of sight are relatively shorter than dimensions across the line of sight projected views ( either auxiliary or multiview ) which show a cross section of the source object along the specified cut plane these views are commonly used to show internal features with more clarity than may be available using regular projections or hidden lines plans are usually '' scale drawings '' , meaning that the plans are drawn at specific ratio relative to the actual size of the place or object various scales may be used for different drawings in a set for example , a floor plan may be drawn at 1:50 ( 1:48 or ″ 1′ 0″ ) whereas a detailed view may be drawn at 1:25 ( 1:24 or ″ 1′ 0″ ) on one hand , it is a general principle of engineering drawings that they are projected using standardized , mathematically certain projection methods and rules thus , great effort is put into having an engineering drawing accurately depict size , shape , form , aspect ratios between features , and so on the first principle—that drawings will be made so carefully and accurately—serves the prime goal of why engineering drawing even exists , which is successfully communicating part definition and acceptance criteria—including '' what the part should look like if you 've made it correctly the second principle—that even though scaling the drawing will usually work , one should nevertheless never do it—serves several goals , such as enforcing total clarity regarding who has authority to discern design intent , and preventing erroneous scaling of a drawing that was never drawn to scale to begin with ( which is typically labeled '' drawing not to scale '' or '' scale : nts '' ) when part definition is defined mathematically via a solid model , the assertion that one can not interrogate the model—the direct analog of '' scaling the drawing '' —becomes ridiculous ; because when part definition is defined this way , it is not possible for a drawing or model to be '' not to scale '' a 2d pencil drawing can be inaccurately foreshortened and skewed ( and thus not to scale ) , yet still be a completely valid part definition as long as the labeled dimensions are the only dimensions used , and no scaling of the drawing by the user occurs ) but if a mathematical model—essentially , a vector graphic—is declared to be the official definition of the part , then any amount of '' scaling the drawing '' can make sense ; there may still be an error in the model , in the sense that what was intended is not depicted ( modeled ) ; but there can be no error of the '' not to scale '' type—because the mathematical vectors and curves are replicas , not symbols , of the part features in the past , prints were plotted on a plotter to exact scale ratios , and the user could know that a line on the drawing 15mm long corresponded to a 30mm part dimension because the drawing said '' 1:2 '' in the '' scale '' box of the title block and the metric technical pens were chosen in sizes so that one could add detail or drafting changes with a pen width changing by approximately a factor of the square root of 2 however , the international organization for standardization ( iso ) called for four pen widths and set a colour code for each : 0.25 ( white ) , 0.35 ( yellow ) , 0.5 ( brown ) , 0.7 ( blue ) ; these nibs produced lines that related to various text character heights and the iso paper sizes all iso paper sizes have the same aspect ratio , one to the square root of 2 , meaning that a document designed for any given size can be enlarged or reduced to any other size and will fit perfectly given this ease of changing sizes , it is of course common to copy or print a given document on different sizes of paper , especially within a series , e.g when cad drawings became more popular , especially using us american software , such as autocad , the nearest font to this iso standard font was romantic simplex ( romans ) - a proprietary shx font ) with a manually adjusted width factor ( over ride ) to make it look as near to the iso lettering for the drawing board the title block ( t/b , tb ) is an area of the drawing that conveys header-type information about the drawing , such as : drawing title ( hence the name '' title block '' ) drawing number part number ( s ) name of the design activity ( corporation , government agency , etc ) identifying code of the design activity ( such as a cage code ) address of the design activity ( such as city , state/province , country ) measurement units of the drawing ( for example , inches , millimeters ) default tolerances for dimension callouts where no tolerance is specified boilerplate callouts of general specs intellectual property rights warning traditional locations for the title block are the bottom right ( most commonly ) or the top right or center the next assembly block , often also referred to as '' where used '' or sometimes '' effectivity block '' , is a list of higher assemblies where the product on the current drawing is used general notes ( g/n , gn ) apply generally to the contents of the drawing , as opposed to applying only to certain part numbers or certain surfaces or features usually views and sections are called out with cross-references to specific zones of the field thus today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing
