the war of the second coalition in northern italian began with the inconclusive battle of verona on 26 march 1799 between the habsburg army of paul kray and the republican french army of italy under barthélemy louis joseph schérer finding his strong position behind the mincio river outflanked on the north by 12,000 austrians , schérer left 12,000 troops to hold the key fortress of mantua , directed 1,600 more to defend peschiera del garda and retreated to the west on 12 april two days later , alexander suvorov arrived at vicenza with an russian empire army and assumed command of the combined austro-russian forces the next day at verderio , jean-mathieu-philibert sérurier 's division was surrounded and in the fighting that followed the french lost 252 men killed before the 2,700 survivors gave up 80-82 early june found the allied main body of 47,087 troops under suvorov , rosenberg and michael von melas camped near turin on 14 april 1799 , the french directory ordered macdonald to help the french forces in northern italy accordingly , he assembled the army of naples and moved north , leaving southern italy in the hands of local forces in order to accomplish this , he asked moreau to march north and east to meet him near piacenza , an impractical move that would place the army of italy in the midst of its enemies 87 as it moved north , the army of naples absorbed the divisions of victor , montrichard and gaultier , bringing its total field force to 36,728 soldiers the russian commander quickly made up his mind to move east to confront macdonald meanwhile , a french squadron put in at genoa on 2 june to drop off french reinforcements suvorov ordered bellegarde 's corps to march on alessandria to keep an eye on moreau while the rest of his army concentrated against macdonald because macdonald 's offensive across the apennines was so unlikely , it took the austrian covering forces by surprise 158 during the pursuit , macdonald was set upon by a troop of french royalist cavalry and suffered saber cuts on the head and arm before his own soldiers could finish off their enemies in a period of 24 hours the allied army covered 90 on 16 june at 10:00 am , macdonald 's vanguard arrived near piacenza and began pressing ott 's command by this time austrian military engineer albert johann de best got the piacenza citadel into a defensible state after eight days of work ; two or three companies of the fröhlich regiment were assigned to garrison it victor 's division led the french attack on ott as rusca 's soldiers edged toward the south as if to flank the austrians out of position that night , suvorov 's chief of staff johann gabriel chasteler de courcelles rushed toward ott 's position with 100 dragoons of the karaczay regiment plus a half-battery of horse artillery a second source stated that there were 17,000 russians and 20,000 austrians present and added three battalions of the fröhlich nr on 17 june at 8:00 am the french opened their attack against ott 's positions behind the tidone the french divisions were deployed with victor on the right , rusca in the center and dombrowski on the left as senior officer victor should have assumed tactical control of the fight , but he stayed in piacenza , resulting in poor coordination of the french effort as dombrowski 's troops mounted a flank attack to the south , the troops of victor 's division fought their way to the village of sarmato where they were held up by an austrian artillery battery and two battalions of the nádasdy regiment nevertheless , at 3:00 pm the french overran both sarmato and its defending battery , forcing ott 's troops back to a position in front of castel san giovanni by the end of the day , 30,656 austrian and russian troops were present to face the now-outnumbered french meanwhile , suvorov and chasteler planned to throw three columns at the french , with the main strength on the right to break down macdonald 's flank by advancing from the tidone to the trebbia and finally all the way to the nure , the next river to the east the first column on the right was headed by bagration 's advance guard followed by schveikovsky 's division an alert french staff officer , pierre edmé gautherin brought the divisions of rusca and victor to the west bank of the trebbia where they stopped and drove back bagration 's troops seeing these french reinforcements in his front , melas decided not to release fröhlich 's division the third column commander sent ott forward at 6:00 pm and the austrians easily brushed aside salme 's outnumbered unit that night in a bizarre operation , rosenberg took two russian grenadier battalions across the trebbia south of gossolengo hearing what they believed to be moreau 's artillery , three french battalions mounted an extemporaneous attack at 9:30 pm , surprising an austrian battalion in the meantime , melas noticed the presence of strong enemy forces at the north end of the battleline and sent 12 artillery pieces to the west bank of the trebbia to blast the french positions also during the morning , the french set up a battery of 10 to 12 guns and began to hammer förster 's positions this was apparently to cover a shift to the south by a body of french troops accompanied in person by suvorov , the russians defeated their mostly polish opponents with serious losses and forced them to retreat to the east bank farther north , victor 's division was repulsed by a combination of schveikovsky 's left wing and förster 's division and withdrew to the french-held east bank but with bagration 's forces pulled to the south by dombrowski 's ill-fated attack , rusca 's men found a gap in the allied line south of casaliggio the combined attack forced rusca 's division to retire to the east bank olivier 's assault was preceded by a lightning cavalry charge around noon that swept the west bank clear of austrians the infantry crossed in the cavalry 's wake and soon captured san nicolò and two guns hearing cannon fire , liechtenstein went forward to check on the situation and found a crowd of austrian troops running away from olivier 's assault he immediately went back to his command and led two squadrons each of the lobkowitz and levenehr dragoons and one squadron of the archduke joseph hussars against olivier 's south flank having disposed of montrichard 's division earlier , the allies were free to mass against olivier 's division and eventually throw it back to the trebbia 's east bank around the same time that olivier made his attack , salme 's advanced guard and watrin 's division , which had previously been in reserve , crossed the trebbia on the far right flank moving in two bodies , the french force brushed aside the austrian outpost line the french maintained a firm grip on the west bank of the trebbia , but macdonald 's division commanders were not able to give him any estimate of their remaining strength suvorov determined to finish with the french so he ordered a new attack at 4:00 am on 20 june when the allied forces reached the west bank they found macdonald 's army gone digby smith reported similar allied losses , though he included three russian generals wounded dupuy rounded the losses to 10,000 french and 7,000 allied , but asserted that 5,000 french became prisoners during the retreat that followed however , ott was held up at the nure by a full french division farther south at san giorgio piacentino the karaczay dragoons charged the 17th light infantry but were rudely repulsed and the french gunners knocked out two of the austrian cannons a total of 1,099 french soldiers surrendered along with six guns and three colors suvorov determined from captured dispatches that macdonald 's mangled army was no longer a threat to northern italy and marched the allied army back west on the 23rd , hoping to catch moreau between himself and belegarde macdonald ordered montrichard 's division to the east where it was used to form some garrisons which were subsequently captured by 28 june the army of naples was back at pistoia where it stayed for several days before marching to the west coast in early july
