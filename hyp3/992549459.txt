traditionally , forging was performed by a smith using hammer and anvil , though introducing water power to the production and working of iron in the 12th century allowed the use of large trip hammers or power hammers that increased the amount and size of iron that could be produced and forged forging can produce a piece that is stronger than an equivalent cast or machined part as the metal is shaped during the forging process , its internal grain texture deforms to follow the general shape of the part hot forging prevents the work hardening that would result from cold forming , which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece owing to the size of the massive forging hammers and presses and the parts they can produce , as well as the dangers inherent in working with hot metal , a special building is frequently required to house the operation most forging operations use metal-forming dies , which must be precisely machined and carefully heat-treated to correctly shape the workpiece , as well as to withstand the tremendous forces involved image : forgedconrodshowingetchedsection-s.jpg thumb upright a cross-section of a forged connecting rod that has been etched to show the grain flow there are many different kinds of forging processes available ; however , they can be grouped into three main classes : drawn out : length increases , cross-section decreases upset : length decreases , cross-section increases squeezed in closed compression dies : produces multidirectional flow common forging processes include : roll forging , swage , cogging , open-die forging , impression-die forging ( close die forging ) , press forging , cold forging automatic hot forging and upsetting the main advantage of hot forging is that it can be done more quickly and precisely , and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the recrystallization process cold forging typically results in work hardening of the piece the process is called '' edging '' because it is usually carried out on the ends of the workpiece depending on the size and complexity of the part , the hammer may be dropped multiple times in quick succession in commercial impression-die forging , the workpiece is usually moved through a series of cavities in a die to get from an ingot to the final form the first impression is used to distribute the metal into the rough shape in accordance to the needs of later cavities ; this impression is called an '' edging '' , '' fullering '' , or '' bending '' impression the following cavities are called '' blocking '' cavities , in which the piece is working into a shape that more closely resembles the final product if there is only a short run of parts to be done , then it may be more economical for the die to lack a final impression cavity and instead machine the final features closed-die forging has a high initial cost due to the creation of dies and required design work to make working die cavities the various sections are balanced to avoid extreme difference in metal flow full advantage is taken of fiber flow lines barrelling occurs when , due to friction between the work piece and the die or punch , the work piece bulges at its centre in such a way as to resemble a barrel this leads to the central part of the work piece to come in contact with the sides of the die sooner than if there were no friction present , creating a much greater increase in the pressure required for the punch to finish the forging
