the two sections of limes in germany cover a length of from the north-west of the country to the danube in the south-east fossatum africae , the southern frontier of the roman empire , extending south of the roman province of africa in north-africa 125–147 the term was also commonly used after the 3rd century ad to denote a military district under the command of a dux limitis the perimeter defence of hadrian 's wall was achieved through the construction of camps ( castella ) on the lowlands , which were built along the most important roads in the north this section of the limes existed from the 3rd to 5th centuries ad and covered the provinces of : britannia inferior belgica lugdunensis aquitania this limes of the late antiquity ran through the territory of the present-day united kingdom and france in the 3rd century , a separate military district , the litus saxonicum , was established on the british side of the english channel between the estuaries of the wash and the solent , to repel saxon pirates and plunderers most of the saxon shore camps probably served as naval bases this limes was a river border ( limes ripa ) on the rhine , defended by a chain of camps , that ran from the north sea ( katwijk-brittenburg camp ) to vinxtbach ( opposite rheinbrohl fort on the upper germanic limes ) , forming the border between the roman provinces of germania inferior and germania superior each camp had its own river port or landing stage and a storage area , because the rhine not only formed the border but was also the most important transport and trade route in the region here there were also larger legion camps ; with one exception , all were cavalry barracks consequently , in this area there was only one cavalry camp from the 2nd century , the strategic reserve comprised three legions stationed in bonna/bonn , novaesium/neuss , vetera/xanten and noviomagus/nijmegen this limes existed from the 1st to 5th centuries ad and guarded the provinces of : germania superior rhaetia it lay on the territory of the present german states of rhineland-palatinate , hesse , baden-württemberg and bavaria to the north , it bordered those parts of the roman province of rhaetia that lay north of the danube and guarded the eastern border of that part of germania superior that lay east of the rhine in upper germania the border defences initially consisted only of a post road the exact route of the limes along the border between upper germania and raetia has not been fully explored from the 2nd century , the strategic reserve was formed from three legions stationed in mogontiacum/mainz , argentorate/strasbourg and castra regina/regensburg as early as the period 15 bc to about 70 ad , the border between rome and germania ran mostly along the line of the late antique danube-iller-rhine limes ( dirl ) before the romans advanced further north into the agri decumates because of troop withdrawals and massive barbarian invasions , the upper germanic-rhaetian limes were abandoned in the late 3rd century and the roman forces pulled the border back to the banks of the three rivers especially around the year 300 , the emperor diocletian had new fortifications built directly on the river banks or on major roads in the hinterland here this section of the limes existed from the 1st to the 5th century ad and guarded part of the roman province of noricum every camp had its own river port or landing stage and a storage area because the danube was not only border zone , but also the most important transport and trade route in the region although this section of the frontier was relatively well protected by the danube river border or ripa , the roman military presence here was always exceptionally strong ( three military camps in pannonia , but only one in lower pannonia ) because especially after the abandonment of roman dacia in the late 3rd century , the pressure of migrant peoples from the east on this section of the limes intensified the military camps were therefore built by the most important fords or confluences and road termini the initial wood and earth structures , were systematically converted under emperor hadrian into stone barracks and , in the 4th century , redesigned and massively strengthened in order to match new strategic requirements in late roman times huge inland camps were built and towns in the hinterland were fortified to create a second line of defence at the greatest extent of the roman empire , the southern border lay along the deserts of arabia in the middle east ( see romans in arabia ) and the sahara in north africa , which represented a natural barrier against expansion in africa romans controlled the area north of the sahara , from the atlantic ocean to egypt , with many sections of limes ( limes tripolitanus , limes numidiae , etc map of roman africa the fossatum africae ( '' african ditch '' ) of at least 750 & nbsp ; km controlled the southern borders of the empire and had many similarities of construction to hadrian 's wall fossatum africae ( '' african ditch '' ) is a linear defensive structure ( limes ) that extended over 750 & nbsp ; km or more this figure depends very much on the way it is measured over the intervals where the fossatum was not constructed or has disappeared , and includes a significant section which may not be a fossatum in north africa constructed during the roman empire to defend and control the southern borders of the empire in the africa ( roman province ) it is considered to have many similarities of construction to hadrian 's wall at the northern border of the empire in britain the fossatum is accompanied by many small watchtowers and numerous forts , often built within sight of one another the limes saxoniae in holstein was established in 810 ad , long after the fall of the western roman empire great wall , structures of similar scale and function , built by various dynasties in china sasanian defense lines , the borders of the neo-persian empire limitanei , soldiers on the late roman and early byzantine limites march ( territorial entity ) , medieval european borderlands the pale , the english-controlled strip of ireland
