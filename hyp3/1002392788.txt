a film score may also be called a background score , background music , film soundtrack , film music , screen composition , screen music , or incidental music the composer usually enters the creative process towards the end of filming at around the same time as the film is being edited , although on some occasions the composer is on hand during the entire film shoot , especially when actors are required to perform with or be aware of original diegetic music the composer is shown an unpolished '' rough cut '' of the film before the editing is completed and talks to the director or producer about what sort of music is required for the film in terms of style and tone the director and composer will watch the entire film , taking note of which scenes require original music occasionally , a filmmaker will actually edit his or her film to fit the flow of music , rather than have the composer edit their score to the final cut similarly , the relationship between director sergio leone and composer ennio morricone was such that the finale of the good , the bad and the ugly and the films once upon a time in the west and once upon a time in america were edited to morricone 's score as the composer had prepared it months before the film 's production ended the extra-terrestrial was edited to match the music of his long-time collaborator john williams : as recounted in a companion documentary on the dvd , spielberg gave williams complete freedom with the music and asked him to record the cue without picture ; spielberg then re-edited the scene later to match the music in some circumstances , a composer will be asked to write music based on his or her impressions of the script or storyboards without seeing the film itself and is given more freedom to create music without the need to adhere to specific cue lengths or mirror the emotional arc of a particular scene this approach is usually taken by a director who does not wish to have the music comment specifically on a particular scene or nuance of a film and which can instead be inserted into the film at any point the director wishes during the post-production process when writing music for film , one goal is to sync dramatic events happening on screen with musical events in the score these are put on the film by the music editor at points specified by the composer the actual musical content of a film score is wholly dependent on the type of film being scored , and the emotions the director wishes the music to convey the style of the music being written also varies massively from project to project , and can be influenced by the time period in which the film is set , the geographic location of the film 's action , and even the musical tastes of the characters as part of their preparations for writing the score the composer will often research different musical techniques and genres as appropriate for that specific project ; as such , it is not uncommon for established film composers to be proficient at writing music in dozens of different styles the nature and level of orchestration varies from project to project and composer to composer , but in its basic form the orchestrator 's job is to take the single-line music written by the composer and '' flesh it out '' into instrument-specific sheet music for each member of the orchestra to perform more rarely , the director will talk to the composer before shooting has started , so as to give more time to the composer or because the director needs to shoot scenes ( namely song or dance scenes ) according to the final score sometimes the director will have edited the film using '' temp ( temporary ) music '' : already published pieces with a character that the director believes to fit specific scenes however , some films have very little or no music ; others may feature a score that plays almost continuously throughout in some instances , film composers have been asked by the director to imitate a specific composer or style present in the temp track george burt , the art of film music , northeastern university press on other occasions , directors have become so attached to the temp score that they decide to use it and reject the original score written by the film composer one of the most famous cases is stanley kubrick 's 2001 : a space odyssey , where kubrick opted for existing recordings of classical works , including pieces by composer györgy ligeti rather than the score by alex north , although kubrick had also hired frank cordell to do a score '' source music '' ( or a '' source cue '' ) comes from an on screen source that can actually be seen or that can be inferred ( in academic film theory such music is called '' diegesis '' music , as it emanates from the '' diegesis '' or '' story world '' ) some consider film music to be a defining genre of classical music in the late 20th century , if only because it is the brand of classical music heard more often than any other others see the great bulk of film music as meritless the most popular works by composers such as john williams are still far from entering the accepted classical canon , although there is a growing appreciation for the broader contribution of composers such as williams among some classical composers and critics ; for example , the norwegian contemporary classical composer marcus paus has said that he considers williams to be '' one of the great composers of any century '' who has '' found a very satisfying way of embodying dissonance and avant-garde techniques within a larger tonal framework '' and who '' might also have come the closest of any composer to realizing the old schoenbergian utopia that children of the future would be whistling 12-tone rows '' even so , considering they are often the most popular modern compositions of classical music known to the general public , major orchestras sometimes perform film music concerts , as do pops orchestras in 1983 , a non-profit organization , the the film music society , was formed to preserve the '' byproducts '' of creating a film score , including the music manuscripts ( written music ) and other documents and studio recordings generated in the process of composing and recording scores which , in some instances , have been discarded by movie studios the written music must be kept to perform the music on concert programs and to make new recordings of it before the age of recorded sound in motion pictures , efforts were taken to provide suitable music for films , usually through the services of an in-house pianist or organist , and , in some cases , entire orchestras , typically given cue sheets as a guide german cinema , which was highly influential in the era of silent movies , provided some original scores such as fritz lang 's movies die nibelungen ( 1924 ) and metropolis ( 1927 ) which were accompanied by original full scale orchestral and leitmotific scores written by gottfried huppertz , who also wrote piano-versions of his music , for playing in smaller cinemas in france before the advent of talkies , erik satie composed what many consider the first '' frame by frame '' synchronous film score for director rené clair 's avant-garde short entr'acte ( 1924 ) when sound came to movies , director fritz lang barely used music in his movies anymore mabuse only included one original piece written for the movie by hans erdmann played at the very beginning and end of the movie a landmark event in music synchronization with the action in film was achieved in the score composed by max steiner for david o sometimes , a composer may unite with a director by composing the score for many films of a same director the first production music library was set up by de wolfe music in 1927 with the advent of sound in film , the company originally scored music for use in silent film afi 's 100 years of film scores filmi , bollywood film music hollywood studio symphony , the trade name of contracted los angeles session musicians performing many post-2002 hollywood film scores list of film score composers list of film director and composer collaborations music of bollywood musivisual language sheet music theatre music score , a 2016 documentary film about film scores
