the wine received its name , '' port '' , in the latter half of the 17th century from the seaport city of porto at the mouth of the douro river , where much of the product was brought to market or for export to other countries in europe the grapes grown in this zone are considered of higher quality , being used in bottlings of vintage , reserve , aged tawny and late bottled vintage ports white ports are produced the same way as red ports , except that they use white grapes & nbsp ; – donzelinho branco , esgana-cão , folgasão , gouveio , malvasia fina , rabigato and viosinho while the grapes used to produce port made in portugal are strictly regulated by the instituto do vinho do porto , wines from outside this region which describe themselves as port may be made from other varieties port from portugal comes in several styles , which can be divided into two broad categories : wines matured in sealed glass bottles , and wines that have matured in wooden barrels portwine.com ruby port the wine is usually blended to match the style of the brand to which it is to be sold the wine is fined and cold filtered before bottling and does not generally improve with age , although premium rubies are aged in wood from four to six years in 2002 the ivdp prohibited the use of the term '' vintage character '' , as reserve ruby port had neither a single vintage ( usually being a blend of several vintages of ruby ) nor the typical character of vintage port it is technically a ruby port , but fermented in a similar manner to a rosé wine , with a limited exposure to the grape skins , thus creating the rose color they are sweet or medium dry and typically consumed as a dessert wine , but can also pair with a main course 492 when a port is described as tawny , without an indication of age , it is a basic blend of wood-aged port that has spent time in wooden barrels , typically at least three years it is also possible to produce an aged white port in this manner , with some shippers now marketing aged white ports note : in some places , such as canada , tawny may also be used to describe any port-style wine that is not produced in portugal as per agreement with eu colheita port should not be confused with vintage port : a vintage port will spend only about 18 months in barrels after harvest and will continue to mature in bottle , but a colheita may have spent 20 or more years in wooden barrels before being bottled and sold it is required by the ivdp that wines spend some time in wood , usually between three and six years , followed by at least a further eight years in glass , before bottling white port is made from white grapes , such as malvasia fina , donzelinho , gouveio , codega and rabigato , and can be made in a wide variety of styles , although until recently few shippers have produced anything other than a standard product ordinary white ports make an excellent basis for a cocktail while those of greater age are best served chilled on their own in addition to this type of wine , there is the white port colheita , which is obtained from a single harvest and ages in huge tanks acquiring a straw color , has mature and elegant aromas and flavours , featuring fruity and wooden notes , and the white port with an indication of age , which is an elegant , full-bodied and rich port , obtained from the blend of different wines with the same average age when white ports are matured in wood for long periods , the color darkens , eventually reaching a point where it can be hard to discern ( from appearance alone ) whether the original wine was red or white late bottled vintage ( often referred to simply as lbv ) was originally wine that had been destined for bottling as vintage port , but because of lack of demand was left in the barrel for longer than had been planned over time it has become two distinct styles of wine , both of them bottled between four and six years after the vintage , but one style is fined and filtered before bottling , while the other is not the earliest known reference to a style of port with this name in a merchant 's list is to be found in the wine society 's catalogue from 1964 , which includes fonseca 's quinta milieu 1958 , bottled in the uk , also in 1964 however , many wine experts feel that this convenience comes at a price and believe that the filtration process strips out much of the character of the wine unlike vintage port , which has to be sourced from grapes from a single vintage , crusted port affords the port blender the opportunity to make best use of the varying characteristics of different vintages vintage ports may be aged in barrels or stainless steel for a maximum of two and a half years before bottling , and generally require another 10 to 40 years of aging in the bottle before reaching what is considered a proper drinking age particularly fine vintage ports can continue to gain complexity for many decades after they were bottled '' vintage port is made entirely from the grapes of a declared vintage year while it is by far the most renowned type of port , from a volume and revenue standpoint , vintage port accounts for only about two percent of overall port production '' much of the complex character of aged vintage port comes from the continued slow decomposition of grape solids in each bottle most of the large port wine houses have a single quinta bottling which is only produced in some years when the regular vintage port of the house is not declared in those years , wine from their best quinta is still bottled under a vintage designation , rather than being used for simpler port qualities while a vintage is simply the year in which a wine is made , most producers of vintage port restrict their production of year-labelled bottlings to only the best years , a few per decade contrast with second wines , where ( primarily ) bordeaux producers release a year-labelled top wine almost every year , but also lesser quality wines in some years in very good years , almost all the port houses will declare their wines in intermediate years , the producers of blended vintage ports will not declare their flagship port , but may declare the vintage of a single quinta , e.g ukwinesonline – decanting port info ( accessed 3 july 2008 ) once opened , port generally lasts longer than unfortified wine , but it is still best consumed within a short period of time tawny , ruby , and lbv ports may keep for several months once opened ; because they are aged longer in barrels , these ports have already been exposed to some degree of oxidation old vintage ports are best consumed within several days of opening , but young vintage ports can be kept open for several weeks , if not months when very young in the early history of the port wine trade , many of the most powerful shipping families were british ( english and scottish ) and irish ; this history can still be seen in the names of many of the most famous port wines
