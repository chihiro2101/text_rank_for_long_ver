front-loaders tend to require separate pumps and plumbing to provide lint filters which are often mounted behind covers on the bottom of the machine another advantage to the top loading design is the reliance on gravity to contain the water , rather than potentially trouble-prone or short-lived front door seals top loaders may require less periodic maintenance , since there is no need to clean a door seal or bellows , although a plastic tub may still require a periodic '' maintenance wash '' cycle ( described below ) because less water is required , front-loaders typically use less soap , and the repeated dropping and folding action of the tumbling can easily produce large amounts of foam or suds in most machines , the interlock is usually doubly redundant to prevent either opening with the drum full of water or being opened during the spin cycle nearly all front-loader washers for the consumer market also use a folded flexible bellows assembly around the door opening , to keep clothing contained inside the basket during the tumbling wash cycle commercial and industrial front-loaders used by businesses ( described below ) usually do not use the bellows , and instead require all small objects to be placed in a mesh bag to prevent loss near the basket opening the bellows has a large number of flexible folds to permit the tub to move separately from the door during the high speed extraction cycle some front-loading washer operating instructions say the bellows should be wiped down monthly with a strong bleach solution , while others offer a special '' freshening '' cycle where the machine is run empty with a strong dosing of bleach the drum bearing eventually wears out , and usually requires extensive dismantling of the machine to replace , which often results in the machine being write-off due to the failure of a relatively inexpensive component that is labor-intensive to renew some manufacturers have compounded this problem by '' overmolding '' the drum bearing into the outer tub to reduce manufacturing costs , but this makes the bearing impossible to renew without replacing the entire outer tub - which usually forces owners to scrap the entire machine - this may be viewed as an implementation of planned obsolescence some machines which actually load from the top are otherwise much more similar to front-loading horizontal-axis drum machines these machines are narrower but usually taller than front-loaders , usually have a lower capacity , and are intended for use where only a narrow space is available , as is sometimes the case in europe in principle , these machines are convenient for overnight cleaning ( the combined cycle is considerably longer ) , but the effective capacity for cleaning larger batches of laundry is drastically reduced the drying process tends to use much more energy than using two separate devices , because a combo washer dryer not only must dry the clothing , but also needs to dry out the wash chamber itself these machines are used more where space is at a premium , such as areas of europe and japan , because they can be fit into small spaces , perform both washing and drying , and many can be operated without dedicated utility connections true front-loaders , and top-loading machines with horizontal-axis drum as described above , can be compared with top-loaders on a number of aspects : efficient cleaning : front-loaders usually use less energy , water , and detergent compared to the best top-loaders they usually take somewhat longer ( 20â€“110 minutes ) to wash a load , but are often computer controlled with additional sensors , to adapt the wash cycle to the needs of each load water usage : front-loaders usually use less water than top-loading residential clothes washers higher spin speeds , along with the diameter of the drum , determine the g-force , and a higher g-force removes more residual water , making clothes dry faster front-loaders use paddles in the drum to repeatedly pick up and drop clothes into water for cleaning ; this gentler action causes less wear top-loaders usually need a mechanical transmission ( due to agitators , see above ) , which can generate more noise than the rubber belt or direct drive found in most front loaders however , many current front-loaders use so little water that they can be stopped mid-cycle for addition or removal of laundry , while keeping the water level in the horizontal tub below the door level best practice installations of either type of machine will include a floor drain or an overflow catch tray with a drain connection , since neither design is immune to leakage or a solenoid valve getting stuck in the open position on the other hand , in countries with a large front-loader user base , top-loaders are usually seen as alternatives and more expensive than basic off-brand front loaders , although without many differences in total cost of ownership apart from design-originated ones in addition , manufacturers have tended to include more advanced features such as internal water heating , automatic dirt sensors , and high-speed emptying on front-loaders , although some of these features could be implemented on top-loaders over time machines became more and more automated , first with very complex electromechanical controllers , then fully electronic controllers ; users put clothes into the machine , select a suitable program via a switch , start the machine , and come back to remove clean and slightly damp clothes at the end of the cycle the controller starts and stops many different processes including pumps and valves to fill and empty the drum with water , heating , and rotating at different speeds , with different combinations of settings for different fabrics however , due to efficient use of water and detergent , the sudsing issue with front-loaders can be controlled by simply using less detergent , without lessening cleaning action modern washing machines use less water due to environmental concerns ; however , this has led to the problem of poor rinsing on many washing machines on the market , which can be a problem to people who are allergy to detergents in response to complaints , many washing machines allow the user to select additional rinse cycles , at the expense of higher water usage and longer cycle time if a heated clothes dryer is used after the wash and spin , energy use is reduced if more water has been removed from clothes for example , a small high-speed centrifuge machine may be provided in locker rooms of communal swimming pools to allow wet swimsuits to be substantially dried to a slightly damp condition after daily use fewer runs of a machine of larger capacity may have lower running costs and better energy and water efficiency than frequent use of a smaller machine , particularly for large families the old federal standard applicable until january 1 , 2011 included no restriction on water consumption ; washer manufacturers faced no legal restriction on how much unheated rinse water could be used often commercial washers are installed in long rows with a wide access passageway behind all the machines to allow maintenance without moving the heavy machines the features of a commercial laundromat washer are more limited than those of a consumer washer , usually offering just two or three basic wash programs and an option to choose wash cycle temperatures the common front-loading commercial washing machine also differs from consumer models in its expulsion of wash and rinse water while the consumer models pump used washer water out , allowing the waste line to be located above the washer , front-loading commercial machines generally use only gravity to expel used water the trough is usually part of a cement platform built for the purpose of raising the machines to a convenient height , and can be seen behind washers at most laundromats by contrast , commercial washers for internal business operations ( still often referred to as '' washer/extractor '' machines ) may include features absent from domestic machines many commercial washers offer an option for automatic injection of five or more different chemical types , so that the operator does not have to deal with constantly measuring out soap products and fabric softeners for each load by hand this specialized high-capacity machine does not have a drum where everything being washed undergoes distinct wash and rinse cycles , but moves the laundry slowly and continuously through a long , large-diameter horizontal-axis rotating tube in the manner of an assembly line , with different processes at different positions due to the increasing cost of repairs relative to the price of a washing machine , there has been a major increase in the number of defective washing machines being discarded , to the detriment of the environment different washing machine models vary widely in their use of water , detergent , and energy because of their use of hot water , washing machines are among the largest consumers of energy in a typical modern home
