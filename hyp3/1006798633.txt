the allies first expressed their principles and vision for the world after world war ii in the declaration of st james 's palace in june 1941 langer and gleason , chapter 21 they made their joint declaration on 14 august 1941 from the us naval base on the bay , naval base argentia , which had recently been leased from britain as part of a deal that saw the americans give 50 surplus destroyers to british for use against german u-boats although the us would not enter the war as a combatant until the attack on pearl harbor , four months later 4 , 6 roosevelt 's attempts to tie britain to concrete war aims and churchill 's desperation to bind the us to the war effort helped to provide motivations for the meeting that produced the atlantic charter it was assumed at the time that the british and the americans would have an equal role to play in any postwar international organization that would be based on the charter 's principles the atlantic charter made it clear that the united states supported britain in the war 5 a fundamental aim was to focus on the peace that would follow , not specific american involvement and war strategy , although american involvement appeared increasingly likely churchill 's account of the yalta conference quoted roosevelt as saying of the unwritten british constitution that '' it was like the atlantic charter – the document did not exist , yet all the world knew about it the allies , which had met in june , and leading organizations quickly and widely endorsed the charter the text cited the charter as the authoritative statement of the joint commitment of britain and the united states '' not to admit any economical discrimination of those defeated '' and promised that '' germany and the other states can again achieve enduring peace and prosperity 80 the charter proved to be one of the first steps towards the formation of the united nations initially , roosevelt and churchill appeared to have agreed that the third point of the charter would not apply to africa and asia public opinion in britain and the commonwealth was delighted with the principles of the meetings but disappointed that the us was not entering the war 395–420 the british were forced to agree to those aims , but in a september 1941 speech , churchill stated that the charter was meant to apply only to states under german occupation , certainly not to those that were part of the british empire 59 self-determination was roosevelt 's guiding principle , but he was reluctant to place pressure on the british in regard to india and other colonial possessions , as they were fighting for their lives in a war in which the united states was not officially participating gandhi refused to help the british or the american war effort against germany and japan in any way , and roosevelt chose to back churchill churchill was unhappy with the inclusion of references to the right to self-determination and stated that he considered the charter an '' interim and partial statement of war aims designed to reassure all countries of our righteous purpose and not the complete structure which we should build after the victory during the war , churchill argued for an interpretation of the charter that would allow the soviet union to continue to control the baltic states , an interpretation that was rejected by the united states until march 1944 18 ; lord beaverbrook warned that the charter '' would be a menace to our britain 's own safety as well as to that of the soviet union describing meeting with churchill , where churchill vehemently states that the uk is in no way bound to the principles of the atlantic charter
