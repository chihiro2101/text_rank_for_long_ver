the very reactive nature of the lower boranes meant that crystal structure determination was impossible before william lipscomb developed the requisite techniques lastly , once the structures were known it became clear that new theories of chemical bonding were needed to explain them borane clusters are classified as follows , where n is the number of boron atoms in a single cluster : pp 151-195 the iupac nomenclature of chemistry for systematic naming is based on a prefix denoting a class of compound , followed by the number of boron atoms and finally the number of hydrogen atoms in parentheses the ionic charge value is included in the chemical formula but not as part of the systematic name wade 's rules provide a powerful method that can be used to rationalize the structures in terms of the number of atoms and the connectivity between them there are continuing efforts by theoretical chemists to improve the treatment of the bonding in boranes—an example is stone 's tensor surface harmonic treatment of cluster bonding with an alkali metal hydride , for example , : b 2 h 6 + 2 h − → 2 bh 4 − further demonstrating that they are not in general '' electron-deficient '' ( see above ) , boranes can also function as electron donors owing to the relative basic character of the low-polarity b-h terminal groups , as in reactions with halogens to form haloboranes the reaction of some lower boranes with air is strongly exothermic ; those of b 2 h 6 and b 5 h 9 , for example , occur explosively except in very low concentration by contrast , many closo-borane anions , such as b 12 h 12 2− , do not react with air ; salts of these anions are metastable because the closo- structure creates a very high activation energy barrier to oxidation it makes use of the fact that 10 b has a very high neutron-capture cross section , so neutron irradiation is highly selective for the region where the compound resides : 10 b + 1 n → ( 11 b ) → 4 he + 7 li + γ ( 2.4 mev ) boranes have a high specific energy of combustion compared to hydrocarbons , making them potentially attractive as fuels
