nearly all cell membranes in animals , plants and fungi maintain a voltage difference between the exterior and interior of the cell , called the membrane potential some types of cells , however , are electrically active in the sense that their voltages fluctuate over time in some types of electrically active cells , including neurons and muscle cells , the voltage fluctuations frequently take the form of a rapid upward spike followed by a rapid fall action potentials are driven by channel proteins whose configuration switches between closed and open states as a function of the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell all cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized – in other words , they maintain a voltage difference across the cell 's plasma membrane , known as the membrane potential in neurons , the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell , giving the dendrites , axon , and cell body different electrical properties as a result , some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable ( capable of generating action potentials ) , whereas others are not each excitable patch of membrane has two important levels of membrane potential : the resting potential , which is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell , and a higher value called the threshold potential the shape of the action potential is stereotyped ; this means that the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10–100 per second action potentials result from the presence in a cell 's membrane of special types of voltage-gated ion channels a voltage-gated ion channel is a cluster of proteins embedded in the membrane that has three key properties : it is capable of assuming more than one conformation thus , a voltage-gated ion channel tends to be open for some values of the membrane potential , and closed for others ion channels switch between conformations at unpredictable times : the membrane potential determines the rate of transitions and the probability per unit time of each type of transition voltage-gated ion channels are capable of producing action potentials because they can give rise to positive feedback loops : the membrane potential controls the state of the ion channels , but the state of the ion channels controls the membrane potential thus , in some situations , a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open , thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential the time and amplitude trajectory of the action potential are determined by the biophysical properties of the voltage-gated ion channels that produce it several types of channels capable of producing the positive feedback necessary to generate an action potential do exist if the membrane potential is raised above a certain level , the channel shows increased probability of transitioning to the activated ( open ) state one function of action potentials is rapid , long-range signaling within the organism ; the conduction velocity can exceed 110 & nbsp ; m/s , which is one-third the speed of sound the integration of various dendritic signals at the axon hillock and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of computation , one that has been exploited biologically to form central pattern generators and mimicked in artificial neural networks it focused on three goals : isolating signals from single neurons or axons , developing fast , sensitive electronics , and shrinking electrodes enough that the voltage inside a single cell could be recorded the second problem was addressed with the crucial development of the voltage clamp , which permitted experimenters to study the ionic currents underlying an action potential in isolation , and eliminated a key source of electronic noise , the current i c associated with the capacitance c of the membrane the third problem , that of obtaining electrodes small enough to record voltages within a single axon without perturbing it , was solved in 1949 with the invention of the glass micropipette electrode , which was quickly adopted by other researchers the channel is primarily in a high conductance state punctuated by random and relatively brief transitions to a low conductance states while glass micropipette electrodes measure the sum of the currents passing through many ion channels , studying the electrical properties of a single ion channel became possible in the 1970s with the development of the patch clamp by erwin neher and bert sakmann such inhibitors of ion channels serve an important research purpose , by allowing scientists to '' turn off '' specific channels at will , thus isolating the other channels ' contributions ; they can also be useful in purifying ion channels by affinity chromatography or in assaying their concentration carlo matteucci followed up galvani 's studies and demonstrated that cell membranes had a voltage across them and could produce direct current in 1907 , louis lapicque suggested that the action potential was generated as a threshold was crossed , what would be later shown as a product of the dynamical systems of ionic conductances they made the first actual recording of the electrical changes across the neuronal membrane that mediate the action potential this line of research culminated in the five 1952 papers of hodgkin , katz and andrew huxley , in which they applied the voltage clamp technique to determine the dependence of the axonal membrane 's permeabilities to sodium and potassium ions on voltage and time , from which they were able to reconstruct the action potential quantitatively hodgkin and huxley correlated the properties of their mathematical model with discrete ion channels that could exist in several different states , including '' open '' , '' closed '' , and '' inactivated '' the crystal structures of related ionic pumps have also been solved , giving a broader view of how these molecular machines work
