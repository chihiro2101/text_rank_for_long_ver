typically , it arises from the reaction of hydrogen chloride with magnesium silicide : : mg 2 si + 4 hcl → 2 mgcl 2 + sih 4 it is also prepared from metallurgical grade silicon in a two-step process first , silicon is treated with hydrogen chloride at about 300 & nbsp ; °c to produce trichlorosilane , hsicl 3 , along with hydrogen gas , according to the chemical equation : : si + 3 hcl → hsicl 3 + h 2 the trichlorosilane is then converted to a mixture of silane and silicon tetrachloride this redistribution reaction requires a catalyst : :4 hsicl 3 → sih 4 + 3 sicl 4 the most commonly used catalysts for this process are metal halogen , particularly aluminium chloride it may also be thought of as a disproportionation reaction even though there is no change in the oxidation number for silicon ( si has a nominal oxidation number iv in all three species ) the silicon atom could be rationalized as having the highest formal oxidation state and partial positive charge in sicl 4 and the lowest formal oxidation state in sih 4 since cl is far more electronegative than is h an alternative industrial process for the preparation of very high purity silane , suitable for use in the production of semiconductor grade silicon , starts with metallurgical grade silicon , hydrogen , and silicon tetrachloride and involves a complex series of redistribution reactions ( producing byproducts that are recycled in the process ) and distillations another commercial production of silane involves reduction of silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) under al and h 2 gas in a mixture of nacl and aluminum chloride ( alcl 3 ) at high pressures : shriver and atkins this may be classified as a heterogeneous acid-base chemical reaction since the isolated si 4 − ion in the mg 2 si antifluorite structure can serve as a brønsted–lowry base capable of accepting four protons the possible products include sih 4 and/or higher molecules in the homologous series si n h 2n+2 , a polymeric silicon hydride , or a silicic acid however , the difficulties in explaining the available ( often contradictory ) combustion data are ascribed to the fact that silane itself is stable and that the natural formation of larger silanes during production , as well as the sensitivity of combustion to impurities such as moisture and to the catalytic effects of container surfaces causes its pyrophoricity consequently , compounds containing si–h bonds are much more reactive than is h 2 in japan , in order to reduce the danger of silane for amorphous silicon solar cell manufacturing , several companies began to dilute silane with hydrogen gas
