a dynamical system is generally described by one or more differential or difference equations the equations of a given dynamical system specify its behavior over any given short period of time to determine the system 's behavior for a longer period , it is often necessary to integral the equations , either through analytical means or through iteration , often with the aid of computers the subset of the phase space of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the attractor , also known as the attracting section or attractee some attractors are known to be chaotic ( see strange attractor ) , in which case the evolution of any two distinct points of the attractor result in exponentially chaos theory , which complicates prediction when even the smallest noise is present in the system the definition of an attractor uses a metric on the phase space , but the resulting notion usually depends only on the topology of the phase space until the 1960s , attractors were thought of as being geometric primitive of the phase space , like points , lines , surfaces , and simple regions of three-dimensional space more complex attractors that can not be categorized as simple geometric subsets , such as topology wild sets , were known of at the time but were thought to be fragile anomalies two simple attractors are a fixed point and the limit cycle a fixed point of a function or transformation is a point that is mapped to itself by the function or transformation if we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations , then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation but the fixed point ( s ) of a dynamic system is not necessarily an attractor of the system in addition , physical dynamic systems with at least one fixed point invariably have multiple fixed points and attractors due to the reality of dynamics in the physical world , including the nonlinear dynamics of stiction , friction , surface roughness , deformation ( both elastic and plasticity ) , and even quantum mechanics in a discrete-time system , an attractor can take the form of a finite number of points that are visited in sequence ( the limit cycle of an ideal pendulum is not an example of a limit cycle attractor because its orbits are not isolated : in the phase space of the ideal pendulum , near any point of a periodic orbit there is another point that belongs to a different periodic orbit , so the former orbit is not attracting ) for example , in physics , one frequency may dictate the rate at which a planet orbits a star while a second frequency describes the oscillations in the distance between the two bodies if a strange attractor is chaotic , exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions , then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor , after any of various numbers of iterations , will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart ( subject to the confines of the attractor ) , and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together strange attractors may also be found in the presence of noise , where they may be shown to support invariant random probability measures of sinai–ruelle–bowen type since these classes describe the behavior of the system over long times , after transients have passed , we can create an analogy to the attractors defined above while continuous systems like a pendulum may get exponentially close to an attractor , cellular automata can reach attractors in finite time this behavior can be thought of as similar to a strange attractor , due to its chaotic nature and potential to create fractional dimensional shapes class 4 : these systems mix order with randomness ; they generate localized structures which can move and interact with each other in complicated ways this can be thought of as analogous to the non-integrability of systems which generate strange attractors , most notably the lorenz system
