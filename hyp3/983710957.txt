the three most popular ways of analysing a street network are integration , choice and depth distance integration measures the amount of street-to-street transitions needed from a street segment , to reach all other street segments in the network , using shortest paths integration can also be analyzed in local scale instead of the scale of the whole network theoretically , the integration measure shows the cognitive complexity of reaching a street , and is often argued to 'predict ' the pedestrian use of a street : the easier it is to reach a street , the more popular it should be when the same procedure has been conducted using each segment as a starting point for the initial value of one , a graph of final values appears like integration , choice analysis can be restricted to limited local radii , for instance 400m , 800m , 1600m space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets , but , strictly speaking , choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street space syntax has also been applied to predict the correlation between spatial layouts and social effects such as crime , traffic flow , and sales per unit area in general , the analysis uses one of many software programs that allow researchers to analyse graphs of one ( or more ) of the primary spatial components this brought together in one place a comprehensive review of the programme of research up to that point , but also developed a full theoretical account for how the buildings and settlements we construct an not merely the product of social processes , but also play a role in producing social forms
