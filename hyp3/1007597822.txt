the technology was first deployed in a local area network as part of the hello routing protocol and implemented in the fuzzball router , an experimental operating system used in network prototyping , where it ran for many years other related network tools were available both then and now more complete synchronization systems , although lacking ntp 's data analysis and clock disciplining algorithms , include the unix daemon timed , which uses an election algorithm to appoint a server for all the clients ; and the digital time synchronization service ( dtss ) , which uses a hierarchy of servers similar to the ntp stratum model despite the relatively slow computers and networks available at the time , accuracy of better than 100 milliseconds was usually obtained on atlantic spanning links , with accuracy of tens of milliseconds on ethernet networks in 1988 , a much more complete specification of the ntpv1 protocol , with associated algorithms , was published in it introduced a management protocol and digital signature scheme which have both survived into ntpv4 , along with the bulk of the algorithm the rfc included an analysis of all sources of error , from the master clock down to the final client , which enabled the calculation of a metric that helps choose the best server where several candidates appear to disagree in subsequent years , as new features were added and algorithm improvements were made , it became apparent that a new protocol version was required ntp uses a hierarchical , semi-layered system of time sources in addition to stratum , the protocol is able to identify the synchronization source for each server in terms of reference identifier ( refid ) simple network time protocol ( sntp ) is a less complex implementation of ntp , using the same protocol but without requiring the storage of state over extended periods of time it is used in some embedded systems and in applications where full ntp capability is not required w32time was originally implemented for the purpose of the kerberos version 5 authentication protocol , which required time to be within 5 minutes of the correct value to prevent replay attacks microsoft states that w32time can not reliably maintain time synchronization with one second accuracy if higher accuracy is desired , microsoft recommends using a newer version of windows or different ntp implementation windows 10 and windows server 2016 support 1 & nbsp ; ms time accuracy under certain operating conditions whilst it is aimed more closely at the simpler generic needs of openbsd users , it also includes some protocol security improvements while still being compatible with existing ntp servers it has two main components : chronyd , a daemon that is executed when the computer starts , and chronyc , a command line interface to the user for its configuration although the ntp clock is actually halted during the event , because of the requirement that time must appear to be monotonically increasing , any processes that query the system time cause it to increase by a tiny amount , preserving the order of events some implementation errors are basic , such as a missing return statement in a routine , that can lead to unlimited access to systems that are running some versions of ntp in the root daemon similar to the dns amplification attack , the server responds with a much larger reply that allows an attacker to substantially increase the amount of data being sent to the target
