memín is a restless boy who is not a very good student , not because of a lack of intelligence , but for not being able to pay attention ( he is surprisingly good at arithmetic ) memín is accompanied in his adventures by a group of three loyal friends : ; carlos '' carlangas '' arozamena : a shrewd curly-haired boy who was abandoned by his rich father and was raised by his working class mother , and while they fail to reconcile they decide to bring carlangas a better future sending him to live with his father , but carlos got homesick and came back to his mother 's side later , with the help of ricardo and his friends , he has better clothes and helps his father to overcome his alcoholism and an accident that almost left him without a leg he is memín 's best friend and was involved in one of memín 's dreams when both go to china his father decided it would be better for him to attend a public school ; a self-made man , he thinks his son was being pampered too much at private schools at first he had significant troubles fitting in , until some incidents after school led to create a bond with memín and his friends , to the point of standing up to his mother to defend them when his parents tried to get a divorce , he ran away to guadalajara to live with his godmother , but memín , who accompanied him , left a note to eufrosina , leading ricardo 's parents to them her main stories were concerned to adopt a pretty girl that was abandoned in a park while memín was playing even the poverty of the family ; later she tries to get a job in new york city but not without having memín lost and then confronting memín homesick attitude after an unfortunate job in a mansion in a later adventure , he dies bringing an uproar among fans and pushing the creator to avoid killing another characters some stories later , memín was punished to study with the lower grade kids and while doing this makes a mischief that pushes the teacher really angry so she went to professor romero 's classroom to complain about it ; however romero stands for memín and , in the process , the teachers fell in love and they are married later in an earlier story , memín and his friends go to ricardo 's house after the then spoiled kid decides to make them to take a bath because of a mud fight they were involved in another , memín decides not eucharist , after a cruel boy tells him blacks are not allowed in heaven , pointing to the lack of black angels in religious paintings as proof ( this was inspired by a popular song '' angelitos negros '' that asked the same question and a popular mexican motion picture of 1948 of the same name ) after sales plummeted in response to the boycott , an issue was published in which memín 's friends , with the aid of the church priest , paint one of the angels in the church black ; memín returns to church and dreams of becoming an angel in yet another adventure called '' líos gordos '' memín and his friends travel to texas to play soccer lios gordos 2 on flickr - photo sharing ! in a later adventure , memín and eufrosina decide to work in new york city but memín gets lost in the process and begins working for a mexican family where a blind girl begins to bring affection to her new employee finally , memín and his friends went along a millionaire to africa , where the most racial details were put in hot place , first memín got a motherly friendship with a female gorilla , that later tends to be very useful for the kids to save the millionaire to be killed by his ambitious son later , they got trapped by cannibals that thought that memín is a gift from the gods because of his bald condition and they named him king , just to be captured by slave traders ( that freed memín 's friends in the process ) and , while memín was suffering in the ship , his friends finally freed him not without having a very angry memín punching everyone ( including his friends ) due to their bad attitude over black people the average age of the comic reader in mexico was higher than in the united states , about 18 instead of 13 , not just for children : the mexican comic book in the late 1960s and 1970s by harold e memín says '' and this job is one that african-americans really want to do '' poking fun on the 2005 comment of president fox , but probably also telling the irony over the fact that an african-american is currently the president of the united states ( and that the latest issue of memín pinguín in usa was called memín for president )
