experience of a miner 's son going to oxford university where he finds himself torn between two worlds , culminating in barton 's participation in a television documentary this mirrored potter 's

provide uncredited script work on james and the giant peach ( released 1995 ) —his chief contribution providing dialogue for the sardonic caterpillar potter 's reputation within the american film industry following the box office disappointments of pennies from heaven and gorky park ultimately led to difficulty receiving backing for his projects potter is known to have written adaptations of

where so many journalists crawl on 15 march 1994 , three months before his death , potter gave an interview to melvyn bragg , later broadcast on 5 april 1994 by channel 4 ( he had broken most of his ties with the bbc as a result of his disenchantment with directors-general michael checkland and especially john birt , whom he had referred to as a '' croak-voiced dalek '' ) telling bragg that he had two works he intended to finish ( '' my only regret is if i die four pages too soon '' ) , he proposed that these works , karaoke and cold lazarus , should be made with the rival bbc and channel 4

nigel barton ) and works where '' the child is father to the man '' , in which he used adult actors to play children ( stand up , nigel barton ; blue remembered hills ) they are frequently deployed in works where the line between fantasy and reality becomes blurred , often as a result of the influence of popular culture ( willie , the wild west obsessive played by hywel bennett in where the buffalo roam ) or from a character 's apparent awareness of their status as a pawn in the hands of an omniscient author ( the actor jack black ( denholm elliott ) in follow the yellow brick road first

popular songs in pennies from heaven to potter 's gnostic retelling of jesus ' final days in son of man although potter won few awards , he is held in high regard by many within the television and film industry , and was an influence on such creators as mark frost , steven bochco , bochco 's musical drama cop rock ( 1990 ) was inspired by the singing detective davies , who chose potter , stated that '' there can be no writer working in television today , or in any medium , who can claim even half the influence of dennis potter '' bbc four marked the tenth anniversary of potter 's death in
