this assumption is important for the possibility of comparing and aggregating the degrees of pleasure of different experiences , for example , in order to perform the utilitarian calculus pleasure refers to a certain type of experience while well-being is about what is good for a person many philosophers agree that pleasure is good for a person and therefore is a form of well-being but there may be other things besides or instead of pleasure that constitute well-being , like health , virtue , knowledge or the fulfillment of desires on some conceptions , happiness is identified with '' the individual ’ s balance of pleasant over unpleasant experience '' life satisfaction theories , on the other hand , hold that happiness involves having the right attitude towards one 's life as a whole pleasure may have a role to play in this attitude , but it is not identical to happiness pleasure is closely related to value , desire , motivation and right action chapter v , an introduction to the principles of morals and legislation , bentham , 1789 , some commentators see 'complex pleasures ' including wit and sudden realisation , complex pleasure : forms of feeling in german literature , stanley corngold , stanford press , 1998 and some see a wide range of pleasurable feelings theories of pleasure try to determine what all these pleasurable experiences have in common , what is essential to them quality theories hold that pleasure is a quality of pleasurable experiences themselves while attitude theories state that pleasure is in some sense external to the experience since it depends on the subject 's attitude to the experience an obvious shortcoming of this theory is that many impressions may be present at the same time instead , the subject has to have the right attitude to this taste for pleasure to arise this approach captures the intuition that a second person may have exactly the same taste-experience but not enjoy it since the relevant attitude is lacking one important argument against this version is that while it is often the case that we desire something first and then enjoy it , this can not always be the case one way to combine these elements is to hold that pleasure consists in being disposed to desire an experience in virtue of the qualities of this experience some of the problems of the regular desire theory can be avoided this way since the disposition does not need to be realized for there to be pleasure , thereby taking into account that desire and pleasure can come apart ethical hedonism takes the strongest position on this relation in stating that considerations of increasing pleasure and decreasing pain fully determine what we should do or which action is right this position entails that things other than pleasure , like knowledge , virtue or money , only have instrumental value : they are valuable because or to the extent that they produce pleasure but lack value otherwise instead , they argue that the quality is another factor relevant to the value of a pleasure-experience , for example , that the lower pleasures of the body are less valuable than the higher pleasures of the mind we take pleasure from many things that are not beautiful , which is why beauty is usually defined in terms of a special type of pleasure : aesthetic or disinterested pleasure opponents of aesthetic hedonism have pointed out that despite commonly occurring together , there are cases of beauty without pleasure pleasure is often regarded as a bipolar construct , meaning that the two ends of the spectrum from pleasure to suffering are mutually exclusive yet , some lines of research suggest that people do experience pleasure and suffering at the same time , giving rise to so-called mixed feelings pleasure is considered one of the core dimensions of emotion as such , pleasure is an affect and not an emotion , as it forms one component of several different emotions it asserts that being motivated by pleasure is self-defeating in the sense that it leads to less actual pleasure than following other motives freud also described the pleasure principle as a positive feedback mechanism that motivates the organism to recreate the situation it has just found pleasurable , and to avoid past situations that caused pain daniel kahneman explains this distortion in terms of the difference between two selves : the experiencing self , which is aware of pleasure and pain as they are happening , and the remembering self , which shows the aggregate pleasure and pain over an extended period of time on the positive side , we prefer pleasurable experiences to be in the future rather than in the past based upon the incentive salience model of reward – the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces approach behavior and consummatory behavior – an intrinsic reward has two components : a '' wanting '' or desire component that is reflected in approach behavior , and a '' liking '' or pleasure component that is reflected in consummatory behavior some commentators opine that our current understanding of how pleasure happens within us remains poor , '' how we and our hedonic experience are situated or constituted in our brains and organisms remains to be seen '' prospects seem good for new and deep scientific understanding of pleasure and of how it is organized in the brain in the past , there has been debate as to whether pleasure is experienced by other animals rather than being an exclusive property of humankind ; however , it is now known that animals do experience pleasure , as measured by objective behavioral and neural hedonic responses to pleasurable stimuli
