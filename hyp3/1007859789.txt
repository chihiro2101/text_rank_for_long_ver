his father , jules constant de rebecque , served as a high-ranking officer in the dutch states army , like his grandfather , his uncle and his cousin jean victor de constant rebecque in those years european nobility , with their prerogatives , come under heavy attack from those , like constant , who were influenced by rousseau 's discourse on inequality constant 's family criticized him for leaving out part of his last name in paris , at the home of jean-baptiste-antoine suard he became acquainted with isabelle de charriere , a 46-year-old dutch woman of letters , who later helped publish rousseau 's confessions , and who knew his uncle david-louis constant de rebecque extremely well by virtue of a 15-year correspondence in september 1794 , he met and became interested in the famous and wealthy already married germaine de staël , herself brought up on the principles of rousseau after the reign of terror in france ( 1793–1794 ) , constant became an advocate of bicameralism and of an assembly like the parliament of great britain in revolutionary france this strand of political thought resulted in the constitution of the year iii , the council of five hundred and the council of ancients eventually , in 1802 , the first consul confirmed in his doubts , forced constant to withdraw because of the tenor of his speeches and his close connection with mme de staël in 1803 , at a time when britain and france were at peace , jean gabriel peltier , while living in england , argued that napoleon should be assassinated mackintosh 's speech was widely published in english and also across europe in a french translation by madame de staël he moved back to paris in 1814 , where the french restoration took place and louis xviii had become king during the hundred days of napoleon , who had become more liberal , constant fled to the vendée , but returned when he was invited several times to the tuileries to set up changes for the charter of 1815 he became an opponent of charles x of france during the restoration between 1815 and 1830 tuffrau , manuel d'histoire de la littérature française , hachette , paris 1953 in 1822 , goethe praised constant in the following terms : i spent many instructive evenings with benjamin constant one of the first thinkers to go by the name of '' liberal '' , constant looked to britain rather than to ancient rome for a practical model of freedom in a large mercantile society he stated how the french attempted to apply ancient republican liberties to a modern state constant realized that freedom meant drawing a line between a person 's private life and that of state interference however , he stated that it was naïve for writers to believe that two thousand years had not brought some changes in the customs and needs of the people constant emphasised how citizens in ancient states found more satisfaction in the public sphere and less in their private lives whereas modern people favoured their private life these writers , influential in the french revolution , according to constant , mistook authority for liberty and approved any means of extending the action of the state in françois furet 's words , constant 's '' entire political thought '' revolved around this question , namely the problem of how to justify the terror moreover , constant believed that , in the modern world , commerce was superior to war english text of the charter this was only to last for '' one hundred days '' before napoleon was defeated , but constant 's work nevertheless provided a means of reconciling monarchy with liberty indeed , the french constitution ( or charter ) of 1830 could be seen as a practical implementation of many of constant 's ideas : a hereditary monarchy existing alongside an elected chamber of deputies and a senatorial chamber of peers , with the executive power vested in responsible ministers thus , although often ignored in france , because of his anglo-saxon sympathies , constant succeeded in contributing in a profound ( albeit indirect ) way to french constitutional traditions this was an advance on the prevailing theory in the english-speaking world , which , following the opinion of william blackstone , the 18th-century english jurist , had regarded the king as head of the executive branch in making this clear theoretical distinction between the powers of the king ( as head of state ) and the ministers ( as executive ) , constant was responding to the political reality which had become apparent in britain for more than a century : that is , the ministers , and not the king , are responsible actors , and the king '' reigns but does not rule '' aside from his political and literary output , constant spent forty years working on religion and religious feeling principes de politique , livre viii , chapitre iv he also condemns a religion that is commonly regarded as utilitarian , since it degrades authentic religious feeling the love affair depicted in the finished version of the novel is thought to be based on constant 's affair with anna lindsay , who describes the affair in her correspondence ( published in the revue des deux mondes , december 1930 – january 1931 ) as a young man , constant became acquainted with a literary friend of his uncle , david-louis constant de rebecque the importance of constant 's writings on the liberty
