early sources include an autobiographical passage where al-farabi traces the history of logic and philosophy up to his time , and brief mentions by al-masudi , ibn al-nadim and ibn hawqal arabic

given by the medieval historian ibn khallikān ( died in 1282 ) , who in his work wafayāt ( completed in 669/1271 ) states that farabi was born in the small village of wasij near fārāb ( in what is

'' ( arab , according to the order of the books studied in the curriculum , fārābī was claiming that he had studied porphyry 's eisagoge and aristotle 's categories , de interpretatione , prior and posterior analytics 57–72 giving a positive account , nadia maftouni describes shi'ite aspects of farabi 's writings though he was mainly an aristotelian logician , he included a number of non-aristotelian elements in his works he is also credited with categorizing logic into two separate groups , the first being '' idea '' and the second being '' proof '' as a philosopher , al-farabi was a founder of his own school of early islamic philosophy known as '' farabism '' or '' alfarabism '' , though it was later overshadowed by avicennism al-farabi had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries , and was widely considered second only to aristotle in knowledge ( alluded to by his title of '' the second teacher '' ) in his time al-farabi also wrote a commentary on aristotle 's work , and one of his most notable works is al-madina al-fadila where he theorized an ideal state as in plato 's the republic arabic and islamic natural philosophy and natural science , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy al-farabi argued that religion rendered truth through symbols and persuasion , and , like plato , saw it as the duty of the philosopher to provide guidance to the state al-farabi incorporated the platonic view , drawing a parallel from within the islamic context , in that he regarded the ideal state to be ruled by the prophet-imam , instead of the philosopher-king envisaged by plato al-farabi wrote a short treatise '' on vacuum '' , where he thought about the nature of the existence of void al-farabi wrote social psychology and principles of the opinions of the citizens of the virtuous city , which were the first treatises to deal with social psychology '' amber haque ( 2004 ) , '' psychology from islamic perspective : contributions of early muslim scholars and challenges to contemporary muslim psychologists '' , journal of religion and health 43 ( 4 ) : 357–377 363 in his treatise on the cause of dreams , which appeared as chapter 24 of his principles of the opinions of the citizens of the ideal city , he distinguished between dream interpretation and the nature and causes of dreams the main influence on al-farabi 's philosophy was the neo-aristotelian tradition of alexandria history of islamic philosophy some other significant influences on his work were the planetary model of ptolemy and elements of neo-platonism , motahhari , mortaza , becoming familiar with islamic knowledge , v1 , p:162 particularly metaphysics and practical ( or political ) philosophy ( which bears more resemblance to plato 's republic than aristotle 's politics ) in the handing down of aristotle ’ s thought to the christian west in the middle ages , al-farabi played an essential part as appears in the translation of farabi ’ s commentary and short treatise on aristotle ’ s de interpretatione that f.w farabi had a great influence on maimonides , the most important jewish thinker of the middle ages according to adamson , his work was singularly directed towards the goal of simultaneously reviving and reinventing the alexandrian philosophical tradition , to which his christian teacher , yuhanna bin haylan belonged his success should be measured by the honorific title of '' the second master '' of philosophy ( aristotle being the first ) , by which he was known adamson also says that he does not make any reference to the ideas of either al-kindi or his contemporary , abu bakr al-razi , which clearly indicates that he did not consider their approach to philosophy as a correct or viable one in contrast to al-kindi , who considered the subject of metaphysics to be god , al-farabi believed that it was concerned primarily with being qua being ( that is , being in and of itself ) , and this is related to god only to the extent that god is a principle of absolute being al-kindi 's view was , however , a common misconception regarding greek philosophy amongst muslim intellectuals at the time , and it was for this reason that avicenna remarked that he did not understand aristotle 's metaphysics properly until he had read a prolegomenon written by al-farabi history of islamic philosophy p161 in his discussion of the first cause ( or god ) , al-farabi relies heavily on negative theology each level of existence in al-farabi 's cosmology is characterized by its movement towards perfection , which is to become like the first cause , i.e corbin , p158 according to al-farabi , the afterlife is not the personal experience commonly conceived of by religious traditions such as islam and christianity corbin , p165 however , deborah black mentions we have cause to be skeptical as to whether this was the mature and developed view of al-farabi , as later thinkers such as ibn tufayl , averroes and ibn bajjah would assert that he repudiated this view in his commentary on the nicomachean ethics , which has been lost to modern experts in his treatment of the human soul , al-farabi draws on a basic aristotelian outline , which is informed by the commentaries of later greek thinkers noticeably absent from these scheme are internal senses , such as common sense , which would be discussed by later philosophers such as avicenna and averroes p313 special attention must be given to al-farabi 's treatment of the soul 's imaginative faculty , which is essential to his interpretation of prophethood and prophetic knowledge therefore what makes prophetic knowledge unique is not its content , which is also accessible to philosophers through demonstration and intellection , but rather the form that it is given by the prophet 's imagination the practical application of philosophy was a major concern expressed by al-farabi in many of his works , and while the majority of his philosophical output has been influenced by aristotelian thought , his practical philosophy was unmistakably based on that of plato the ideal society , he wrote , is one directed towards the realization of '' true happiness '' ( which can be taken to mean philosophical enlightenment ) and as such , the ideal philosopher must hone all the necessary arts of rhetoric and poetics to communicate abstract truths to the ordinary people , as well as having achieved enlightenment himself black , p190 al-farabi compared the philosopher 's role in relation to society with a physician in relation to the body ; the body 's health is affected by the '' balance of its humours '' just as the city is determined by the moral habits of its people butterworth , p278 of course , al-farabi realized that such a society was rare and required a very specific set of historical circumstances to be realized , which means very few societies could ever attain this goal black , p191 the best known arabic source for al-farabi 's political philosophy is his work titled , al-madina al-fadila ( the virtuous city ) whether or not al-farabi actually intended to outline a political programme in his writings remains a matter of dispute amongst academics henry corbin , who considers al-farabi to be a crypto- shi'ite , says that his ideas should be understood as a '' prophetic philosophy '' instead of being interpreted politically corbin , p162-163 on the other hand , charles butterworth contends that nowhere in his work does al-farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation ( even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned ) , and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of '' king '' and '' statesmen '' p276 occupying a middle position is david reisman , who , like corbin , believes that al-farabi did not want to expound a political doctrine ( although he does not go so far to attribute it to islamic gnosticism either ) reisman , p68 lastly , joshua parens argues that al-farabi was slyly asserting that a pan-islamic society could not be made , by using reason to show how many conditions ( such as moral and deliberative virtue ) would have to be met , thus leading the reader to conclude that humans are not fit for such a society joshua parens , an islamic philosophy of virtuous religions : introducing alfarabi ( new york : state university of new
