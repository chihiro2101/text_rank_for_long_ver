more in detail norrland is made up of three north-south belts : the scandinavian mountains in the west , the muddus plains covering much of the inland , and the mixed relief of the eastern coast towards the end of the 20th century there was a noticeable increase of the population in norrland , mainly from people moving from bigger cities in older history and still today , the administration in stockholm viewed norrland pretty much as a colony consisting of natural resources to be exploited in the official history of sweden not much is written about the northern parts of the country up to the middle ages , the northern part of norrland ( norrbotten and lappland ) was basically a no man 's land but it took time – even today , finnish and sami minorities live in the northern parts of norrland and have maintained their culture and customs the people of norrland in their turn tend to have a fairly negative view of people from stockholm and the rest of southern sweden , for example by referring to stockholm as '' fjollträsk '' , which loosely translated means '' sissy town '' despite norrland being the most diverse of the three lands of sweden in terms of languages and cultures it is usually portrayed as one homogeneous region fiction usually portrays characters from norrland as villagers from the wilderness even though the majority of the population live in and around the coastal cities unlike most other swedish films , it takes place in a larger community at the northern peak of sweden , being filmed in kalix and kiruna a constantly repeated theme in the book 's background are the social , cultural and physical differences between these two locations : norrland is more sedate , conservative and slow-moving in comparison with the cosmopolitan stockholm ; a stockholmer having to live for an extended period in norrland feels '' exiled to the back of beyond '' ; norrland is also colder , and a stockholmer coming there must urgently buy warmer clothes ( a theme highlighted also in as it is in heaven ) ; norrlanders often speak norrland dialects which stockholm people find nearly incomprehensible ; stockholm people look down their noses at '' a working class boy from norrland '' even when he had lived many years in stockholm
