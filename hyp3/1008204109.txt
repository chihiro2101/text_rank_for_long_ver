here two characteristics are manifest : in general , modern orthodoxy places a high national , as well as religious , significance on the state of israel , and institutions and individuals are , typically , zionist in orientation ; relatedly , involvement with non-orthodox jews will extend beyond '' outreach '' to include institutional relations and cooperation ; see further under torah umadda the specific expression of modern orthodoxy , however , takes many forms , and particularly over the past 30-40 years , describes a political spectrum helmreich and reuel shinnar : modern orthodoxy in america : possibilities for a movement under siege among the issues have been the extent to which modern orthodoxy should cooperate with the more liberal denominations , support secular academic pursuits combined with religious learning , and embrace efforts to give women a larger role in jewish learning and worship ; the acceptability of modern textual criticism as a tool for torah study is also debated it is also noted that many modern orthodox are '' behaviorally modern '' as opposed to '' ideologically modern '' , and , in truth , fall outside of '' modern '' orthodoxy , at least in the philosophical sense ; see below the '' behaviorally modern '' , on the other hand , define themselves as '' modern orthodox '' only in the sense that they are neither haredi ( '' ultra-orthodox '' ) nor conservative : these , in other words , are '' not deeply concerned with philosophical ideas '' , and , often , are not as careful in their observance in fact , even among its leadership , there is limited agreement '' on the philosophical parameters of modern orthodoxy '' similarly , at modern orthodoxy 's left , many appear to align with more traditional elements of conservative judaism in discussing '' modern orthodoxy '' , it is thus also important to clarify its position with reference to other movements in judaism : see comparison with other movements below while hildesheimer 's role is not disputed—comprising distinct philosophy and pragmatic contributions—hirsch 's role is less clear , with some hirsch scholars arguing that his '' torah im derech eretz '' philosophy is in fact at odds with that of modern orthodoxy ; see further below and in the hildesheimer article ( religious zionism , strictly speaking a distinct philosophy , has an indirect influence on the contrary , modern jewish education must teach jews how best to confront and deal with modernity in all of its aspects shapiro , rabbi esriel hildesheimer 's program of torah u-madda his approach , '' cultured orthodoxy '' , was defined as representing '' unconditional agreement with the culture of the present day ; harmony between judaism and science ; but also unconditional steadfastness in the faith and traditions of judaism '' he was , however , '' the pragmatist rather than the philosopher '' , and it is his actions , rather than his philosophy , which have become institutionalized in modern orthodoxy , chaim i torah umadda – '' torah and secular knowledge '' ) is a philosophy concerning the secular world and judaism , and in particular secular knowledge and jewish knowledge it envisions a personal—as opposed to philosophic— '' synthesis '' between torah scholarship and western , secular scholarship , entailing , also , positive involvement with the broader community rabbi ronnie ziegler : introduction to the philosophy of rav soloveitchik : the need for action centrist orthodoxy is the dominant mode of modern orthodoxy in the united states , while torah umadda remains closely associated with yeshiva university although there is some question as how precisely to define the distinction between modern orthodoxy and haredi judaism , there is basic agreement that they may be distinguished on the basis of three major characteristics : modern orthodoxy adopts a relatively inclusive stance toward society in general , and the larger jewish community in particular '' ( note though , that in recent years , many modern orthodox jews are described as '' increasingly stringent in their adherence to jewish law '' both modern orthodoxy and neo orthodoxy , the movement directly descended from hirsch 's frankfurt community , have combined torah and secular knowledge with participation in contemporary western life , and thus some maintain that there is a degree of practical and philosophical overlap between the two differences between the movements may be more than a question of degree : some hirsch scholars argue that hirschian philosophy is at odds with that of modern orthodoxy , see , for example : joseph elias ' introduction to the nineteen letters see , for example : norman lamm torah umadda : the encounter of religious learning and worldly knowledge in the jewish tradition for modern orthodoxy , on the other hand , secular culture and knowledge are seen as a complement to torah , and , to some extent , encouraged for their own sake priority of torah versus secular knowledge : in the hirschian view , torah is the '' sole barometer of truth '' by which to judge secular disciplines , as '' there is only one truth , and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard by contrast , in the view of modern orthodoxy , although torah is the '' preeminent center '' , secular knowledge is considered to offer '' a different perspective that may not agree at all with torah broader communal involvement : neo-orthodoxy , influenced by hirsch 's philosophy on austritt ( secession ) , '' could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the jewish people '' , and is therefore opposed to the mizrachi movement , which is affiliated with the world zionist organization and the jewish agency modern orthodoxy , on the other hand , is characterised by its involvement with the broader jewish community and by its religious zionism broadly defined , religious zionism is a movement that embraces the idea of jewish national sovereignty , often in connection with the belief in the ability of the jewish people to bring about a redemptive state through natural means , and often attributing religious significance to the modern state of israel ) thus , in this sense , religious zionism in fact encompasses a wide spectrum of religious views including modern orthodoxy note , however , that modern orthodoxy , in fact , overlaps to a large extent with mizrachi ( religious zionism ) ( '' throughout the world , a 'religious zionist day school ' is a synonym for a 'modern orthodox day school ' '' further , in practice , except at their extremes , the differences between religious zionism and modern orthodoxy in israel are not pronounced , and they are often identical , especially in recent years and for the younger generation secondly , under religious zionism , a '' nationalistic coloration '' is given to traditional religious concepts , whereas , by contrast , modern orthodoxy includes '' a greater balance which includes openness to the non-jewish world '' ; thus , under religious zionism , the jewish nation is conceived of as an '' organic unity '' , whereas modern orthodoxy emphasises the individual applying the above distinction , in israel today , modern orthodoxy—as distinct from ( right-wing ) religious zionism—is represented by only a select group of institutions : the religious kibbutz movement , ne'emanei torah va'avodah , in some areas , modern orthodoxy 's left wing appears to align with more traditional elements of conservative judaism , and in fact some on the left of modern orthodoxy have allied with the formerly conservative union for traditional judaism avraham weiss : judaism ; fall 1997 weiss argues as follows : torah mi-sinai ( '' torah from sinai '' ) : modern orthodoxy , in line with the rest of orthodoxy , holds that jewish law is divine in origin , and as such , no underlying principle may be compromised in accounting for changing political , social or economic conditions , see for example , rabbi aryeh kaplan , the rules of halacha whereas conservative judaism holds that posek should make use of literary and historical analysis in deciding jewish law , and may reverse decisions of the acharonim that are held to be inapplicable today rabbinic interpretation : ( modern ) orthodoxy contends that legal authority is cumulative , and that a contemporary posek ( decisor ) can only issue judgments based on a full history of jewish legal precedent , whereas the implicit argument of the conservative movement is that precedent provides illustrations of possible positions rather than binding law see also : sacred cluster 6 , jtsa.edu and conservative halakha thus , although conservatism similarly holds that '' no law has authority unless it becomes part of the concern and practice of the community '' elliott n dorff : '' how conservative judaism makes decisions in jewish law halakha '' communal acceptance of a '' permissive custom '' is not '' meaningful '' , and , as a result , related rabbinic legislation can not assume the status of law in general , modern orthodoxy does not , therefore , view the process by which the conservative movement decides halakha as legitimate—or with the non-normative weighting assigned to particular halakha by the conservative movement there is an often repeated contention that modern orthodoxy—beyond its approach to chumrahs ( '' strictures '' ) described above—has lower standards of observance of halakha than other branches of orthodox judaism see for example , what is modern orthodox ? -hashkafah.com this view is largely anecdotal , and is based on individual behaviour , as opposed to any formal , institutional position ; see above : additionally , whereas the modern orthodox position is ( generally ) presented as '' unquestioned allegiance to the primacy of torah , and that the apprehension of all other intellectual disciplines must be rooted and viewed through the prism of torah '' , haredi groups have sometimes compared modern orthodoxy with early reform judaism in germany : modern orthodox rabbis have been criticised for attempting to modify halakha , in adapting judaism to the needs of the modern world note that claims of this nature have been commonplace within orthodox judaism since the first '' reforms '' of samson raphael hirsch and azriel hildesheimer thus , in europe of the early 19th century , all of judaism that differed from the strictest forms present at the time was called '' reform '' the suggestion here is that modern orthodoxy may not provide a directly applicable theology for the contemporary modern orthodox family ; see further discussion under torah umadda many orthodox jews find the intellectual engagement with the modern world as a virtue he is committed to intensive and original torah study , and articulates a bold jewish worldview that embraces modernity , reflecting the tradition of his teacher and father-in-law , rabbi joseph b he is the author of the lonely man of faith and halakhic man , an outspoken zionist , an opponent of extending rabbinic authority into areas of secular expertise , and a proponent of some interdenominational cooperation , such as the rabbinical council of america 's participation in the now-defunct synagogue council of america others include : meimad is a political/intellectual alternative to israel 's highly nationalistic religious parties or those hostile to modern secularist values the jewish orthodox feminist alliance ( jofa ) : a forum for enhancing the roles of orthodox jewish women within the orthodox community , and reducing orthodox religious disabilities against women ne'emanei torah va'avodah is a non-profit organization operating in israel whose proposed goal is '' to forge a more open and tolerant discourse in religious zionism , one that integrates a halachic lifestyle with active engagement in israeli society , in order to strengthen tolerance , equality , and social responsibility ''
