juveniles are largely dark and take about four or five years to acquire the adult plumage they were once visible above calcutta in large numbers they perch on trees nearby and are known to sometimes descend also after dark to feed in forests , their soaring often indicated a tiger kill trees on which they regularly roost are often white from their excreta , and this acidity often kills the trees they sometimes feed on dead vultures allan octavian hume observed '' hundreds of nests '' and noted that white-rumped vultures used to nest on large trees near habitations even when there were convenient cliffs in the vicinity several pairs nest in the vicinity of each other and isolated nests tend to be those of younger birds the young birds remain for about three months in the nest the white-rumped vulture was originally very common especially in the gangetic plains of india , and often seen nesting on the avenue trees within large cities in the region at calcutta one may frequently be seen seated on the bloated corpse of some hindoo floating up or down with the tide , its wing spread , to assist in steadying it ” before the 1990s they were even seen as a nuisance , particularly to aircraft as they were often involved in bird strikes the hunting of the birds for meat by the bandola ( banda ) people there was attributed as a reason this species , as well as the indian vulture and slender-billed vulture has suffered a 99 % population decrease in india and nearby countries since the early 1990s affected vultures were initially reported to adopt a drooped neck posture and this was considered a symptom of pesticide poisoning , but subsequent studies suggested that this may be a thermoregulatory response as the posture was seen mainly during hot weather in southeast asia , the near-total disappearance of white-rumped vultures predated the present diclofenac crisis , and probably resulted from the collapse of large wild ungulate populations and improved management of dead livestock , resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures currently , only the cambodia and burma populations are thought to be viable though those populations are still very small ( low hundreds ) however , they died after a few weeks , apparently because their parents were an inexperienced couple breeding for the first time in their lives – a fairly common occurrence in birds of prey .
