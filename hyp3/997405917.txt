one region contained larger and more luminous stars of spectral types a to m and received the name giant supergiant stars can be identified on the basis of their spectra , with distinctive lines sensitive to high luminosity and low surface gravity because they are enlarged compared to main-sequence and giant stars of the same spectral type , they have lower surface gravities , and changes can be observed in their line profiles supergiants are also evolved stars with higher levels of heavy elements than main-sequence stars in addition to the line changes due to low surface gravity and fusion products , the most luminous stars have high mass-loss rates and resulting clouds of expelled circumstellar materials which can produce emission lines , p cygni profiles , or forbidden lines the phase where these stars have both hydrogen and helium burning shells is referred to as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , as stars gradually become more and more luminous class m stars asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and post-agb stars are highly evolved lower-mass red giants with luminosities that can be comparable to more massive red supergiants , but because of their low mass , being in a different stage of development ( helium shell burning ) , and their lives ending in a different way ( planetary nebula and white dwarf rather than supernova ) , astrophysicists prefer to keep them separate the dividing line becomes blurred at around ( or as high as in some models ) where stars start to undergo limited fusion of elements heavier than helium classical cepheid variables typically have supergiant luminosity classes , although only the most luminous and massive will actually go on to develop an iron core they have spectra dominated by helium and other heavier elements , usually showing little or no hydrogen , which is a clue to their nature as stars even more evolved than supergiants they are evolved , expanded , massive and luminous stars like supergiants , but at the most massive and luminous extreme , and with particular additional properties of undergoing high mass-loss due to their extreme luminosities and instability the stefan-boltzmann law dictates that the relatively cool surfaces of red supergiants radiate much less energy per unit area than those of blue supergiants ; thus , for a given luminosity , red supergiants are larger than their blue counterparts the supergiant luminosity class is assigned on the basis of spectral features that are largely a measure of surface gravity , although such stars are also affected by other properties such as microturbulence hotter supergiants , even the most luminous , have surface gravities around one , due to their higher masses and smaller radii the relative numbers of blue , yellow , and red supergiants is an indicator of the speed of stellar evolution and is used as a powerful test of models of the evolution of massive stars all supergiants are larger and more luminous than main sequence stars of the same temperature the very hottest supergiants with early o spectral types occur in an extremely narrow range of luminosities above the highly luminous early o main sequence and giant stars these are not massive stars , though ; instead , they are stars of intermediate mass that have particularly low surface gravities , often due to instability such as cepheid pulsations these intermediate mass stars ' being classified as supergiants during a relatively long-lasting phase of their evolution account for the large number of low luminosity yellow supergiants the majority of agb stars are given giant or bright giant luminosity classes , but particularly unstable stars such as w virginis variables may be given a supergiant classification ( e.g rv tau stars are frequently assigned spectral types with a supergiant luminosity class on account of their low surface gravity , and they are amongst the most luminous of the agb and post-agb stars , having masses similar to the sun ; likewise , the even rarer pv tel variables are often classified as supergiants , but have lower luminosities than supergiants and peculiar be spectra extremely deficient in hydrogen they are usually supergiants or hypergiants , occasionally with wolf-rayet spectra—extremely luminous , massive , evolved stars with expanded outer layers , but they are so distinctive and unusual that they are often treated as a separate category without being referred to as supergiants or given a supergiant spectral type the abundance of various elements at the surface of supergiants is different from less luminous stars red supergiants can be distinguished from luminous but less massive agb stars by unusual chemicals at the surface , enhancement of carbon from deep third dredge-ups , as well as carbon-13 , lithium and s-process elements this may be due to different levels of mixing on the main sequence due to rotation or because some blue supergiants are newly evolved from the main sequence while others have previously been through a red supergiant phase the existence of these supergiants still burning hydrogen in their cores may necessitate a slightly more complex definition of supergiant : a massive star with increased size and luminosity due to fusion products building up , but still with some hydrogen remaining possibly larger and more luminous than any supergiant known today , their structure was quite different , with reduced convection and less mass loss most type ii supernova progenitors are thought to be red supergiants , while the less common type ib/c supernovae are produced by hotter wolf–rayet stars that have completely lost more of their hydrogen atmosphere supergiants are rare and short-lived stars , but their high luminosity means that there are many naked-eye examples , including some of the brightest stars in the sky
