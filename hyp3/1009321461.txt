that is , it was an alternation between e-grade and zero grade like in '' regular '' ablaut ( further explanations below ) , but followed by a previously unidentified element so , rather than reconstructing ā , ō and ǝ as others had done before , saussure proposed something like ea alternating with a and eo with o , where a and o represented the unidentified elements saussure called them simply '' coefficients sonantiques '' , which was the term for what are now in english more usually called resonants ; that is , the six elements present in pie which can be either consonants ( non-syllabic ) or vowels ( syllabic ) depending on the sounds they are adjacent to : y w r l m n this consonant did not appear to be related to any of the consonants then reconstructed for pie , and various unsatisfactory proposals were made to explain this consonant in terms of the pie consonant system as it had then been reconstructed their appearance explained some other matters as well : for example , why verb roots containing only a consonant and a vowel always have long vowels when a laryngeal is attested directly , it is usually as a special type of vowel and not as a consonant , best exemplified in greek where syllabic laryngeals ( when they appeared next to only consonants ) developed as such : h₁ > e , h₂ > a , and h₃ > o lehmann 's view , based on inconsistent reflexes in hittite , that was two separate sounds some direct evidence for laryngeal consonants comes from anatolian : pie a is a fairly rare sound , and in an uncommonly large number of good etymologies , it is word-initial but in hittite there is a noun '' front , face '' , with various derivatives ( ḫantezzi '' first '' , and so on ) , pointing to a pie root-noun '' face '' ( of which would be the locative singular ) the evidence from hittite and uralic is sufficient to conclude that these sounds were '' guttural '' or pronounced rather back in the vocal tract recently , however , simon ( 2010 ) has supported kloekhorst 's thesis by suggesting that plene spelling in cuneiform luwian can be explained in a similar way weiss ( 2016 ) suggests that this was the case in proto-indo-european proper , and that a shift from uvular into pharyngeal may have been a common innovation of the non-anatolian languages ( before the consonant 's eventual loss ) the hypothetical existence of laryngeals in pie finds support in the body of daughter language cognates which can be most efficiently explained through simple rules of development later it was noticed that the explanatory power of the theory , as well as its elegance , were enhanced if a third element were added , our h₁ , which has the same lengthening and syllabifying properties as the other two but has no effect on the colour of adjacent vowels as mentioned above , in forms like dwi-bhr-o- ( etymon of greek diphrós , above ) , the new '' coefficients sonantiques '' ( unlike the six resonants ) have no reflexes at all in any daughter language this means that there is no possibility of some sort of analogical interference , for example , happened in the case of latin arātrum '' plow '' , whose shape has been distorted by the verb arāre '' to plow '' ( the exact cognate to the greek form would have been aretrum ) it used to be standard to explain the root vowels of greek thetós , statós , dotós '' put , stood , given '' as analogical regarding greek híeros , the pseudo-participle affix -ro- is added directly to the verb root , so - > isero- > ihero- > híeros ( with regular throwback of the aspiration to the beginning of the word ) , and sanskrit iṣirá- but greek attests an earlier ( and rather more widely attested ) form of the same meaning , híaros the explanation for the híeros/híaros business has long been discussed , without much result ; laryngeal theory now provides the opportunity for an explanation which did not exist before , namely the metathesis of the two laryngeals : :it seems likely , though it is less certain , that this same -h₁ underlies the nominative-accusative dual in o-stems : sanskrit vṛkā , greek lúkō '' two wolves '' ( the alternative ending -āu in sanskrit cuts a small figure in the rigveda , but eventually becomes the standard form of the o-stem dual although the founding fathers were able to provide some indirect evidence of a lost consonantal element ( for example , the origin of the indo-iranian voiceless aspirates in ch sequences and the ablaut pattern of the so-called heavy bases , cerə- ~ cr̥̄- in the traditional formulation ) , the direct evidence so crucial for the neogrammarian thinking was lacking while some scholars , like heinz kronasser and giuliano bonfante , attempted to disregard anatolian evidence altogether , the ‘ minimal ’ serious proposal ( with roots in pedersen 's early ideas ) was put forward by hans hendriksen , louis hammerich and later ladislav zgusta , who assumed a single /h/ phoneme without vowel-colouring effects today the laryngeal theory is almost universally accepted in this new standard form
