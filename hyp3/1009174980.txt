like the tomato , persimmons are not commonly considered to be berries , but morphologically the fruit is in fact a berry persimmon trees are typically dioecy , meaning male and female flowers are produced on separate trees in color , the ripe fruit of the cultivated strains range from glossy light gold ( color ) to dark red-orange depending on the species and variety the flesh is astringent until fully ripe and is yellow , orange , or dark-brown in color the calyx generally remains attached to the fruit after harvesting , but becomes easy to remove once the fruit is ripe the ripe fruit has a high glucose content and is sweet in taste while many species of diospyros bear fruit inedible to humans or only occasionally gathered , the following are grown for their edible fruit : some varieties are edible in the crisp , firm state but it has its best flavor when allowed to rest and soften slightly after harvest the '' sharon fruit '' has no core , is seedless and particularly sweet , and can be eaten whole harvested in the fall or after the first frost , its fruit is eaten fresh , in baked goods , or in steamed puddings , and sometimes its timber is used as a substitute for true ebony or african blackwood ( e.g the fruit is green and turns yellow when ripe texana are black on the outside ( as opposed to just on the inside as with the mexican persimmon ) subglobose berries with a diameter of ripen in august the fleshy berries become edible when they turn dark purple or black , at which point they are sweet and can be eaten from the hand or made into pudding or custard commercially and in general , there are two types of persimmon fruit : astringent and non-astringent for domestic purposes , the most convenient and effective process is to store the ripening persimmons in a clean , dry container together with other varieties of fruit that give off particularly large quantities of ethylene while they are ripening ; apples and related fruits such as pears are effective , and so are bananas and several others tanenashi fruit will occasionally contain a seed or two , which can be planted and will yield a larger , more vertical tree than when merely grafted onto the d such seedling trees may produce fruit that bears more seeds , usually 6 to 8 per fruit , and the fruit itself may vary slightly from the parent tree the non-astringent persimmon is squat like a tomato and is most commonly sold as fuyu non-astringent persimmons may be consumed when still very firm and remain edible when very soft there is a third type , less commonly available , the pollination-variant non-astringent persimmons when fully pollinated , the flesh of these fruit is brown inside & mdash ; known as goma in japan & mdash ; and the fruit can be eaten when firm tsurunoko , sold as '' chocolate persimmon '' for its dark brown flesh , maru , sold as '' cinnamon persimmon '' for its spicy flavor , and hyakume , sold as '' brown sugar '' , are the three best known though persimmon trees belong to the same genus as ebony trees , persimmon tree wood has a limited use in the manufacture of objects requiring hard wood image : unripe persimmon.jpg a persimmon harvested while still unripe file : persimmon leaves 2222.jpg persimmon leaves file : persimmon.jpg persimmon leaves in autumn file : diospiros kaki fruit img 5472s.jpg ripe kaki , soft enough to remove the calyx and split the fruit for eating file : orderly dried fruit.jpg peeled , flattened , and dried persimmons ( shìbǐng ) in a xi'an market image : limekaki.jpg kaki preserved in limewater image : dried kaki fruit.jpg hoshigaki , japanese dried persimmon image : persimmon kkakdugi.jpg dangam kkakdugi image : japanese persimmons drying.jpg japanese persimmons hung to dry after fall harvest file : persimmonssidebyside.jpg comparison of hachiya cultivar and jiro cultivar kaki persimmon size image : korean persimmonwood chest.jpg an example of persimmon wood furniture image : persimmonwatercolor.jpg japanese persimmon ( cultivar 'hachiya ' ) - watercolor 1887
