appearance to the limited production ford mustang svo introduced two years earlier in 1983 ) like its exterior , the taurus 's interior was ahead of its time , and many features originating from it are still used in most cars today the most basic model , the l ( see below ) , came standard , with just an am radio and a front cloth bench seat , while the lx , the more luxurious model , came with a greater number of features as standard equipment it won many awards , most notably being named to the 1986 car and driver 10best and becoming the 1986 motor trend car of the year over 200,000 of the

abandoning once-successful nameplates and divisions in search of '' the next big thing '' , while their foreign competitors have been gaining market share by continuously improving their veteran nameplates '' at the time , ford had already unveiled a face-lifted five hundred at the 2007 north american international auto show , which had revised styling and a more powerful engine partially blaming the five hundred 's struggles on its name , mulally decided that the revised vehicle should be marketed as the taurus , the name he believed the five hundred sedan should have used from the beginning as he believed ford was better off continuing to use its older nameplates that maintained decent brand equity rather than trying to build up new ones the fifth generation ( 5g ) taurus entered production in 2007 as a 2008 model and was developed directly from the ford five hundred , chiefly with a mild exterior facelift and revised engine and transmission ford designated the model as the taurus , after the demise of the concurrently marketed fourth generation ( 4g ) taurus and to take advantage of its customer recognition and dealer demand it was determined that ford 's

competes in the mid-size category ) had superior driving dynamics and a more efficient design and offered almost as much interior space as the taurus despite considerably smaller external dimensions the base produced by the sho from the factory may be considered mild only a few years after its initial release , given the subsequent existence of sedans like the dodge charger hellcat first revealed at the 2011 new york auto show , the taurus received a mid-cycle refresh for the 2013 model year on april 25 , 2018 , ford announced plans to discontinue the taurus ( along with the fiesta , focus ,
