although they are usually without other physical symptoms , an outbreak of genital warts may cause psychological distress , such as anxiety , in some people other studies suggest that condoms are not effective at preventing transmission of the low-risk hpv variants that cause genital warts the effect of condoms on hpv transmission may also be sex-dependent ; there is some evidence that condoms are more effective at preventing infection of males than of females although 90 % of hpv infections are cleared by the body within two years of infection , it is possible for infected cells to undergo a latency ( quiet ) period , with the first occurrence or a recurrence of symptoms happening months or years later in individuals with a history of previous hpv infection , the appearance of new warts may be either from a new exposure to hpv , or from a recurrence of the previous infection however , genital warts can sometimes result from autoinoculation by warts elsewhere on the body , such as from the hands genital warts in children are less likely to be caused by hpv subtypes 6 and 11 than adults , and more likely to be caused by hpv types that cause warts elsewhere on the body ( '' cutaneous types '' ) the diagnosis of genital warts is most often made visually , but may require confirmation by biopsy in some cases the vaccine is preventive , not therapeutic , and must be given before exposure to the virus type to be effective , ideally before the beginning of sexual activity cervarix had been used routinely in young females from its introduction in 2008 , but was only effective against the high-risk hpv types 16 and 18 , neither of which typically causes warts existing treatments are focused on the removal of visible warts , but these may also regress on their own without any therapy as many as 80 % of people with hpv will clear the infection within 18 months physically ablative therapies are considered more effective at initial wart removal , but like all therapies have significant recurrence rates many therapies , including folk remedies , have been suggested for treating genital warts , some of which have little evidence to suggest they are effective or safe it is effective , inexpensive , safe for pregnancy , and does not usually cause scarring imiquimod is a topical immune response cream , applied to the affected area it causes less local irritation than podofilox but may cause fungal infections ( 11 % in package insert ) and flu-like symptoms ( less than 5 % disclosed in package insert ) one study testing genital skin for subclinical hpv using pcr found a prevalence of 10 %
