talmon 's 1952 book the origins of totalitarian democracy discusses the transformation of a state in which traditional values and articles of faith shape the role of government into one in which social utility takes absolute precedence he posits that totalitarian democracy , or what he terms '' equality-oriented democracy , '' is founded on the idea that it is possible , and necessary , that the complete rights and freedoms of people ought not be held hostage to traditions and social arrangements he sees the proponents of liberal democracy ( or '' western '' democracy ) as holding a negative attitude to the word and believing that force is not an appropriate way to achieve a goal no matter the value of that goal liberal democrats , who see political strength as growing from the bottom up ( cf : '' grass roots '' ) , reject in principle the idea of coercion in shaping political will , but the totalitarian democratic state holds it as an ongoing imperative , '' public good '' ) and majority rule an argument can be made that in some circumstances it is actually the politics , economic , and military elite who interpret the general will to suit their own interests citizens of a totalitarian democratic state , even when aware of their true powerlessness , may support their government joseph stalin was practically worshipped by hundreds of millions of soviet citizens , many of whom have not changed their opinion even today , and his status ensured his economic and political reforms would be carried out in addressing every aspect of the lives of its citizens , the totalitarian democratic state has the power to ensure that all material needs are met from cradle to grave , and all that is required of the citizen is to carry out his role , whatever it may be , to the best of his ability liberal democracy , on the other hand , posits freedom as something that can and should be achieved by the individual in the short term , even at the expense of things such as material well-being , and sees as an element of this freedom a '' freedom from government '' wherein the individual is able to exercise '' freedom '' in his own terms to the extent that they do not contravene the law yet , rousseau fails to consider that the state is not a total institution within the liberal democracies , and that the freedom of the citizen in between the elections is the freedom of the citizen to live their life in pursuit of their own happiness , subject to the law made by their elected representatives , who are , in turn , subject to popular pressure , protest , petition , recall , referendum , initiative , and ultimately , electoral defeat if they fail to heed the views of those they represent this is in contrast to a totalitarian democracy , with the state as a total institution , where the individual is truly not free without constant participation in their '' democratic '' government ; and thus , the individual in the totalitarian democracy must be '' forced to be free '' if the totalitarian democracy is not to become a totalitarian oligarchy according to him , u.s state objectives have led to internal conditions that resemble totalitarianism : '' it is a power establishment that over the course of the cold war has spun out of control and now threatens not only the fundamental institutions of democracy , but even of life on the planet through the growing risk of nuclear war by miscalculation '' engdahl , full spectrum dominance , pg since western democracies are always justifying state of exception , they are failing as sites of political agency .
