definitions , a dictionary of greek philosophical terms attributed to plato himself but believed by modern scholars to have been written by his immediate followers in the academy , provides the following definition of the word eudaimonia : '' the good composed of all goods ; an ability which suffices for living well ; perfection in respect of virtue ; resources sufficient for a living creature '' in his nicomachean ethics ( §21 ; 1095a15–22 ) , aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings , but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well ; i.e for the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure , wealth or honour… 1095a17 so , as aristotle points out , saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable , and means living well , is not saying very much the candidates that he mentions are a ( 1 ) life of pleasure , ( 2 ) a life of political activity , and ( 3 ) a philosophical life one important move in greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy , aretē ( 'virtue ' ) aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of '' virtuous activity in accordance with reason '' 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 ; even epicurus , who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure , maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue we shall consider the main theories in a moment , but first a warning about the proper translation of areté one problem with the english translation of areté as 'virtue ' is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense , which is not always what the ancients had in mind for a greek , areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics , for example , physical beauty so it is important to bear in mind that the sense of ‘ virtue ' operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom , courage and compassion as this would be considered the most positive state to be in , the word is often translated as 'happiness ' although incorporating the divine nature of the word extends the meaning to also include the concepts of being fortunate , or blessed on the standard english translation , this would be to say that ‘ happiness is doing well and living well ' however , socrates adopted a quite radical form of eudaimonism ( see above ) : he seems to have thought that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia socrates is convinced that virtues such as self-control , courage , justice , piety , wisdom and related qualities of mind and soul are absolutely crucial if a person is to lead a good and happy ( eudaimon ) life moreover , according to socrates , this state of the soul , moral virtue , is the most important good this view is confirmed in the crito , where socrates gets crito to agree that the perfection of the soul , virtue , is the most important good : and is life worth living for us with that part of us corrupted that unjust action harms and just action benefits ? or do we think that part of us , whatever it is , that is concerned with justice and injustice , is inferior to the body ? not at all plato 's great work of the middle period , the republic , is devoted to answering a challenge made by the sophist thrasymachus , that conventional morality , particularly the 'virtue ' of justice , actually prevents the strong man from achieving eudaimonia but if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire , whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire , then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality in brief , plato argues that virtues are states of the soul , and that the just person is someone whose soul is ordered and harmonious , with all its parts functioning properly to the person 's benefit in contrast , plato argues that the unjust man 's soul , without the virtues , is chaotic and at war with itself , so that even if he were able to satisfy most of his desires , his lack of inner harmony and unity thwart any chance he has of achieving eudaimonia this conception of eudaimonia derives from aristotle 's essentialism understanding of human nature , the view that reason ( logos sometimes translated as rationality ) is unique to human beings and that the ideal function or work ( ergon ) of a human being is the fullest or most perfect exercise of reason aristotle clearly maintains that to live in accordance with reason means achieving excellence thereby from this it follows that eudaimonia , living well , consists in activities exercising the rational part of the psyche in accordance with the virtues or excellency of reason 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 the rest of the nicomachean ethics is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason since reason for aristotle is not only theoretical but practical as well , he spends quite a bit of time discussing excellence of character , which enables a person to exercise his practical reason ( i.e while emphasizing the importance of the rational aspect of the psyche , he does not ignore the importance of other ‘ goods ' such as friends , wealth , and power in a life that is eudaimonic therefore , neither our sense-perceptions nor our doxai ( views , theories , beliefs ) tell us the truth or lie ; so we certainly should not rely on them with respect to aretē , the pyrrhonist philosopher sextus empiricus said : if one defines a system as an attachment to a number of dogmas that agree with one another and with phantasiai , and defines a dogma as an assent to something non-evident , we shall say that the pyrrhonist does not have a system but if one says that a system is a way of life that , in accordance with appearances , follows a certain rationale , where that rationale shows how it is possible to seem to live rightly ( '' rightly '' being taken , not as referring only to aretē , but in a more ordinary sense ) and tends to produce the disposition to epoche , then we say that he does have a system but it is important to notice that epicurus does not advocate that one pursue any and every pleasure epicurus ' doctrine can be considered eudaimonist since epicurus argues that a life of pleasure will coincide with a life of virtue epicurus ' basic doctrine is that a life of virtue is the life which generates the most amount of pleasure , and it is for this reason that we ought to be virtuous this thesis—the eudaimon life is the pleasurable life—is not a tautology as '' eudaimonia is the good life '' would be : rather , it is the substantive and controversial claim that a life of pleasure and absence of pain is what eudaimonia consists in he also thinks that eudaimonia is best achieved by a life of virtuous activity in accordance with reason the virtuous person takes pleasure in doing the right thing as a result of a proper training of moral and intellectual character ( see e.g rather , according to epicurus , virtue is only instrumentally related to happiness so whereas aristotle would not say that one ought to aim for virtue in order to attain pleasure , epicurus would endorse this claim zeno believed happiness was a '' good flow of life '' ; cleanthes suggested it was '' living in agreement with nature '' , and chrysippus believed it was '' living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature ) we saw earlier that the conventional greek concept of arete is not quite the same as that denoted by virtue , which has christian connotations of charity , patience , and uprightness , since arete includes many non-moral virtues such as physical strength and beauty moral virtue is good , and moral vice is bad , and everything else , such as health , honour and riches , are merely '' neutral '' the stoics therefore are committed to saying that external goods such as wealth and physical beauty are not really good at all her primary charge in the article is that , as secular approaches to moral theory , they are without foundation in the past god occupied that role , but systems that dispense with god as part of the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful employment of those concepts
