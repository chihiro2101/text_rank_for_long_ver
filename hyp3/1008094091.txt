in earlier forms of the roman rite ( the pre-novus ordo forms ) , some of which are still in use , a requiem mass differs in several ways from the usual mass black was the obligatory liturgical colour of the vestments in the earlier forms , while in the renewed liturgy '' besides violet , white or black vestments may be worn at funeral services and at other offices and masses for the dead '' , general instruction of the roman missal , 346e the sequence dies irae , recited or sung between the tract and the gospel , was an obligatory part of the requiem mass before the novus ordo changes requiem is also used to describe any sacred composition that sets to music religious texts which would be appropriate at a funeral , or to describe such compositions for liturgies other than the roman catholic mass among the earliest examples of this type are the german settings composed in the 17th century by heinrich schütz and michael praetorius , whose works are lutheran adaptations of the roman catholic requiem , and which provided inspiration for the mighty german requiem by brahms however , at least in the russian liturgical tradition , a requiem will often be served on the eve before the glorification ( canonization ) of a saint , in a special service known as the '' last panikhida '' the book of common prayer contained no requiem mass , but instead a service named '' the order for the burial of the dead '' prior to these additions , anglo-catholics or high church anglicans often incorporate parts of the roman catholic requiem mass as part of a funeral service—typically passages from the ordinary of the mass eventually , the dramatic character of the text began to appeal to composers to an extent that they made the requiem a genre of its own , and the compositions of composers such as verdi are essentially concert pieces rather than liturgical works the requiem by johannes ockeghem , written sometime in the latter half of the 15th century , is the earliest surviving polyphony setting image : k626 requiem mozart.jpg thumb left a portion of the manuscript of requiem ( mozart ) ( 1791 ) , showing his heading for the first movement over 2,000 requiem compositions have been composed to the present day there is great variation between compositions in how much of liturgical text is set to music fauré omits the dies iræ , while the very same text had often been set by french composers in previous centuries as a stand-alone work the introit and kyrie , being immediately adjacent in the actual roman catholic liturgy , are often composed as one movement beginning in the 18th century and continuing through the 19th , many composers wrote what are effectively concert works , which by virtue of employing forces too large , or lasting such a considerable duration , prevent them being readily used in an ordinary funeral service ; the requiems of gossec , berlioz , verdi , and dvořák are essentially dramatic concert oratorios in the 20th century the requiem evolved in several new directions these often include extra-liturgical poems of a pacifist or non-liturgical nature ; for example , the war requiem of benjamin britten juxtaposes the latin text with the poetry of wilfred owen , krzysztof penderecki 's polish requiem includes a traditional polish hymn within the sequence , and robert steadman 's mass in black intersperses environmental poetry and prophecy of nostradamus the requiem ebraico ( hebrew requiem ) ( 1945 ) by austrian-american composer eric zeisl , a setting of psalm 92 dedicated to the memory of the composer 's father '' and the other countless victims of the jewish tragedy in europe '' , is considered the first major work of holocaust commemoration the 20th century saw the development of the secular requiem , written for public performance without specific religious observance , such as max reger 's requiem ( 1915 ) , the setting of a german poem titled requiem and dedicated to victims of world war i , and frederick delius 's requiem , completed in 1916 and dedicated to '' the memory of all young artists fallen in the war '' , ;
