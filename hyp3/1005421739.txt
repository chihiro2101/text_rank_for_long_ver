'' river avon '' , therefore , literally means '' river river '' ; several other english and scottish rivers share the name running a somewhat circular path , the river drains east and then south through wiltshire ordnance survey 1:25,000 scale explorer map series sheet no 168 stroud , tetbury & malmesbury after the two rivers merge , the avon then turns south east away from the cotswolds and then quickly south into the clay dauntsey vale , where it is joined by the river marden , until it reaches the biggest town so far , chippenham on the bridge stands a small building which was originally a chapel but later used as a town lock-up the avon valley between bradford on avon and bath is a classic geographical example of a valley where four forms of ground transport are found : road , rail , river , canal the pumping station is located in a pump house built of bath stone , located at river level named after the 3rd duke of cleveland , it spans the river avon at bathwick , and enabled further development of georgian bath to take place on the south side of the river floods in 1799 and 1800 wrecked the north side of the bridge , which had been constructed with inadequate support for most of this distance the navigation makes use of the natural river bed , with six locks overcoming a rise of from bath to netham lock where it divides into the new cut and the floating harbour is in the centre of bath it passes under various bridges including the midland bridge which was originally built by the midland railway company to allow the somerset and dorset joint railway access to and from its green park terminus station weston cut is a man made channel , opened in 1727 , for boats to approach and pass through weston lock , which created an island between the cut and the river weir , which became known as dutch island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century in its heyday , between 1709 and 1859 swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the swineford lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry , as did the river boyd , a tributary which flows into the avon near bitton construction started in 1804 to build the tidal new cut , where it is joined by the river malago , and divert the avon along the feeder canal to the harbour ; a system designed and built by william jessop and later improved by isambard kingdom brunel a weir carries the river into the new cut and boats use the adjacent lock access to the harbour is only possible during the day when the lock keeper will open the gates unless the water level in the river between netham and hanham is above or below the level of the harbour netham lock and the weir form part of bristol 's flood defence mechanisms and it was announced in december 2008 that they would be upgraded as part of the £11 million city docks capital project in central bristol , where the river is tide , it is diverted from its original course into the new cut , a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 at a cost of £600,000 the original course is held at a constant level by lock gates ( designed by jessop ) and is known as the bristol harbour this unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the avon and its tributary , the river frome and siston brook , and is intimately entwined with bristol 's city centre as few docks are as a result of this , the floating harbour is one of the more successful pieces of dockland regeneration , with much of the dockside now occupied by residential , office and cultural premises , and the water area heavily used by leisure craft downstream of central bristol the river passes through the deep avon gorge , spanned by brunel 's clifton suspension bridge , the river is tide and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but drying to a steep sided muddy channel at low tide the main span is long , and the bridge is long , with an air draught above mean high water level of the river then serves two major dock areas at the destructor bridge in bath the typical height range is to with a high of also in december 2013 at netham weir where the new cut carries the flow away from bristol harbour the typical range for the depth of the river is to with the highest ever recorded being for the purpose of water quality monitoring and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas ; south of malmesbury , bristol avon rural and bristol avon urban the site is of considerable importance for studies relating to the possible glaciation of the area , and of the terrace stratigraphy , particularly as it is one of only two accessible terrace deposits in this part of the avon valley a catchment board for the avon was created by the land drainage act 1930 and became the bristol avon river board under the river boards act 1948 ; the board was in turn replaced by the bristol avon river authority under the water resources act 1963 the distribution of archaeological finds suggests that the western end of the river between bath and avonmouth formed a border between the dobunni and durotriges during the late iron age , prior to the roman conquest of britain the river avon had been navigable from bristol to bath during the early years of the 13th century but construction of mills on the river forced its closure the floodplain of the avon , on which the city centre of bath is built , has an altitude of about above sea level throughout bristol 's history the avon gorge has been an important transport route , carrying the river avon , major roads and two railways the bristol channel has a very high tidal range of , second only to bay of fundy in eastern canada ; and the gorge is relatively narrow and meandering , making it notoriously difficult to navigate in 1877 , halfpenny bridge , a pedestrian toll bridge , crossing the river from bath spa railway station to widcombe collapsed with the loss of about 10 lives amongst a large crowd going to the royal bath and west show various points along the river including the valley around freshford are at risk of fluvial flooding , as a result of sediment entering the river and narrowing the channel
