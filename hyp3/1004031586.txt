one of alexander 's hobbies was mechanics and he employed nearly all his spare time in his workshop where he encouraged his youngest son to work with him in all sorts of materials being already interested in mechanics he spent much of his time at the foundry and there he gradually learned to work and turn in wood , brass , iron , and steel in 1820 he left the high school and again made great use of his father 's workshop where at the age of 17 , he made his first steam engine he had heard of the fame of henry maudslay 's workshop and resolved to get employment there ; unfortunately his father could not afford to place him as an apprentice at maudslay 's works nasmyth therefore decided instead to show maudslay examples of his skills and produced a complete working model of a high-pressure steam engine , creating the working drawings and constructing the components himself his connection with the great western railway whose famous steamship ss great western had been so successful in voyages between bristol and new york , led to him being asked to make some machine tools of unusual size and power which were required for the construction of the engines of their next and bigger ship ss great britain in 1837 , the great western steam company was experiencing many problems forging the paddle shaft of the ss great britain ; when even the largest hammer was tilted to its full height its range was so small that if a really large piece of work were placed on the anvil , the hammer had no room to fall , and in 1838 the company 's engineer wrote to nasmyth : '' i find there is not a forge-hammer in england or scotland powerful enough to forge the paddle-shaft of the engine for the great britain ! what am i to do ? ‚Äù ( francis humphries , 1838 ) nasmyth thought the matter over and seeing the obvious defects of the trip hammer ( it delivered every blow with the same force ) sketched out his idea for the first steam hammer nasmyth made a sketch of his steam hammer design dated 24 november 1839 , but the immediate need disappeared when the practicality of screw propellers was demonstrated and the great britain was converted to that design in 1843 a dispute broke out between the two engineers over priority of invention of the steam hammer he enjoyed showing off its capability by demonstrating how it could first break an egg placed in a wine glass , without breaking the glass , which was followed by a full-force blow which shook the building its advantages soon became so obvious that before long nasmyth hammers were to be found in all the large workshops all over the country the pile driver was first demonstrated in a contest with a team using the conventional method at devonport on 3 july 1845 apart from the steam hammer , nasmyth created several other important machine tools , including the shaper , an adaptation of the planer which is still used in tool and die making another innovation was a hydraulic press which used water pressure to force tight-fitting machine parts together nasmyth 's idea of a steam ram for naval warfare was never put into production although milling machines were no longer novel by 1830 , an example built by nasmyth around that time stands out for its prescience a reluctant patentor , and in this instance still working through some problems in his method , nasmyth abandoned the project after hearing of bessemer 's ideas in 1856 nasmyth retired from business in 1856 when he was 48 years old , as he said '' i have now enough of this world 's goods : let younger men have their chance ''
