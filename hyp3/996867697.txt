group relations are described as limited to 'eat-or-be-eaten ' , in contrast to individuals who ( do also eat but ) can engage in more complex types of interaction with the more complex cognition that sexual reproduction and social living require an unbridgeable cognitive gap is assumed to exist between things that make more of themselves by meeting , sharing , mating and protecting offspring , and things that make more of themselves by simply consuming and then splitting off their successor entities a response to this argument is that groups also do not feel hunger , but can act as a means for individuals to satisfy their hunger - this being the main motive for the corporation and collective economic effort , back to earliest systems of irrigation but it may also be true that the school itself acts to attract predators , prevent creative or evasive actions , and acts with some collective intelligence to cut out its weaker members - none of which necessarily benefits the individual fish obeying 'school rules ' some , possibly following jonathan swift , argue that humans are the stupidity of hominids when massed socially , no better than domestic animals bred for either chaos or slavery , and have thus lost much of their capacity to solve ecological or social problems with creativity an interesting question is whether a family which exists primarily or only to provide economic , infrastructural , instructional and emotional support to specific individuals who are related , is a group-entity distinct from feelings or methods of individual sexual animals families unlike the more economic or political entities focused on the outside world , do seem sometimes to merge or alter themselves so as to relate effectively in ways analogous to individuals ' - indeed , a traditional family is formed by exactly such a 'dance ' between two such individuals accordingly , nationalism and the interaction between nation-states ( or the political party that control them ) might be the most appropriate or least controversial application of the theory of group-entities being malignant or inherently competitive and unable to cooperate for common benefit several specific proposals to do this are extant today : the theory of bioregional democracy relates political party and watershed and other ecological border and management problems explicitly , as one solution to the group-entity interest problem
