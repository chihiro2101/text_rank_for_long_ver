typically , each channel 's column contains a number of rotary potentiometer knobs , buttons , and faders for controlling the gain of the input preamplifier , adjusting the equalization of the signal on each channel , controlling routing of the input signal to other functional sections , and adjusting the channel 's contribution to the overall mix being produced a mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks , such as xlr connectors for microphones and the outputs from di boxes , and 1/4 '' jacks for line level sources depending on the mixer , a channel may have buttons which enable the audio engineer to reroute the signal to a different output for monitoring purposes , turn on an attenuator pad ( often reducing the signal by 15 or 20 & nbsp ; db to prevent audio clipping ) , or activate other features , such as a high-pass filter dynamic range compression , gating ) , if supported routing , including direct outs , auxiliary-sends , panning ( audio ) , and subgroup assignments level-control faders ( on small mixers , these may be rotary knobs to save space ) on many consoles , these sections are color-coded for quick identification by the operator for some very strong line level signals , the signal that is plugged into the mixer may be too strong , and cause audio clipping both preamplifiers and pads , and the controls associated with them , are available in the input section of most mixing consoles a mixing console may provide insert points after the input gain stage other program channels may feed one or more computers used for editing or sound playback the cue system allows the operator to listen to one or more selected signals without affecting the console 's main outputs the signal from the cue system is fed to the console 's headphone amp and may also be available as a line-level output that is intended to drive a monitor speaker system when cue is enabled on multiple channels , a mix of these signals is heard through the cue system a bus can often be processed just like an individual input channel , allowing the engineer to process a whole group of signals at once once again using the drum kit example , the use of bus-processing can enable the sound engineer to run all of the drum kit through an audio compressor effect to reduce unwanted signal peaks , rather than having to route all of the 10 or more mic signals on the drum kit individually some higher-end consoles use voltage-controlled amplifier ( vca ) vcas function somewhat like a submix but let the operator control the level of multiple input channels with a single fader this is usually desirable , as post-fader auxiliary sends are commonly used for effects such as reverb , and sends to these effects should track changes in the channel signal level the master control section on a large live venue or sound recording mixer typically has sub-group faders , master faders , master auxiliary mixing bus level controls and auxiliary return level controls subgroup and main output fader controls are often found together on the right hand side of the mixer or , on larger consoles , in a center section flanked by banks of input channels these are either individual bus outputs or auxiliary outputs , used , for instance , to output a different mix to onstage monitors in live sound , the cables from the onstage microphones and instrument outputs are not typically plugged directly into the mixer , because this would require a large number of individual cables to go from the stage to the mixer some mixing consoles , particularly those designed for broadcast and live sound , include facilities for mirroring two consoles , making both consoles exact copies of each other with the same inputs and outputs , the same settings , and the same audio mix digital mixers are more versatile than analog ones and offer many new features , such as reconfiguration of all signal routing at the touch of a button most digital mixers use technology to reduce physical space requirements , entailing compromises in user interface such as a single shared channel adjustment area that is selectable for only one channel at a time many digital mixers allow internal reassignment of inputs so that convenient groupings of inputs appear near each other in the fader bank , a feature that can be disorienting for persons having to make a hardware patch change on the other hand , many digital mixers allow for extremely easy building of a mix from saved data usb flash drives and other storage methods are employed to bring past performance data to a new venue in a highly portable manner at the new venue , the traveling mix engineer simply plugs the collected data into the venue 's digital mixer and quickly makes small adjustments to the local input and output patch layout , allowing for full show readiness in very short order some digital mixers allow offline editing of the mix , a feature that lets the traveling technician use a laptop to make anticipated changes to the show , shortening the time it takes to prepare the sound system for the artist both digital and analog mixers rely on analog microphone preamplifiers , a high-gain circuit that increases the low signal level from a microphone to a level that is better matched to the console 's internal operating level very high-frequency background hiss in an analog mixer is always present , though good gain stage management and turning unused channels down to zero minimizes its audibility many electronic design elements combine to affect perceived sound quality , making the global '' analog mixer vs analog mixing in live sound has had the option since the 1990s of using wired remote controls for certain digital processes such as monitor wedge equalization and parameter changes in outboard reverb devices it is possible to set up a sound system and mix via laptop , touchscreen or tablet computer networks can connect digital system elements for expanded monitoring and control , allowing the system technician to make adjustments to distant devices during the performance the use of remote control technology can be utilized to reduce the amount of venue space used for the front of house mixing console , nicknamed '' seat-kills '' in the music industry for recorded sound , the mixing process can be performed on screen , using computer software and associated input , output and recording hardware public address systems in schools , hospitals and other institutions use a mixing console to set microphones to an appropriate level and can add in recorded sounds such as music into the mix these consoles , often referred to as '' air-boards '' are apt to have many fewer controls than mixers designed for live or studio production mixing , dropping pan/balance , eq , and multi-bus monitoring/aux feed knobs in favor of cue and output bus selectors , since , in a radio studio , nearly all sources are either prerecorded or preadjusted the most basic dj mixers have only two inputs , though some have four or more inputs for djs using a larger number of sound sources
