lancelot may have been the hero of a folk tale that was originally independent but was ultimately absorbed into the arthurian tradition the theft of an infant by a water fairy , the appearance of the hero at a tournament on three consecutive days in three different disguises , and the rescue of a queen or princess from an otherworld prison are all features of a well-known and widespread tale , variants of which are found in numerous examples collected by theodore hersart de la villemarqué in his barzaz breiz , by emmanuel cosquin in his contes lorrains , and by john francis campbell in his tales of the west highlands it is also possibly derived from the old french word l'ancelot , meaning '' servant '' ( the hypothesis first put forward by de la villemarqué in 1842 ) ; lancelot 's name is actually written this way in several manuscripts lancelot 's name appears third on a list of knights at king arthur 's court in the earliest known work featuring him as a character : chrétien de troyes ' erec and enide ( 1170 ) lancelot reappears in chrétien 's cligès , in which he takes a more important role as one of the knights that cligès must overcome in his quest '' chrétien treats lancelot as if his audience were already familiar with the character 's background , yet most of the characteristics and exploits that are commonly associated with lancelot today are first mentioned here in the words of matilda bruckner , '' what existed before chrétien remains uncertain , but there is no doubt that his version became the starting point for all subsequent tales of lancelot as the knight whose extraordinary prowess is inextricably linked to his love for arthur 's queen lancelot 's passion for arthur 's wife guinevere is entirely absent from another early work , lanzelet , a middle high german epic poem by ulrich von zatzikhoven dating from the very end of the 12th century ( no earlier than 1194 ) similar to chrétien 's version , lanzelet too is raised by a water fairy ( here the queen of the maidenland ) , having lost his father king pant of genewis to a rebellion it has been suggested that lancelot was originally the hero of a story independent of the adulterous love triangle and perhaps very similar to ulrich 's version however , the lancelot in prose greatly expands the story : he is assigned a family , a descent from lost kingdom , and many further adventures the forbidden love affair between lancelot and guinevere can be seen as a parallel to that of tristan and iseult , with lancelot ultimately being identified with the tragedy of chance and human failing that is responsible for the downfall of the round table in the later works continuing chrétien 's story lancelot would later become one of the chief knights associated with the holy grail , but chrétien does not include him at all in his final romance , perceval , le conte du graal ( perceval , or the story of the grail ) , the unfinished story that introduced the motif into medieval literature ( in an alternate version from the italian la tavola ritonda , lancelot is born when the late ban 's wife gostanza delivers him two months early and soon after also dies ; here , the lady of the lake 's only relation to lancelot is briefly abducting him as an adult many of them will also join him at the round table , as do all of those mentioned above , as well as some of their sons , such as elyan the white , and lancelot 's own son , too in the prose lancelot , the minor knights of the round table also mentioned as related to lancelot in one way or another are aban , acantan the agile , banin , blamor , brandinor , crinides the black , danubre the brave , gadran , hebes the famous , lelas , ocursus the black , pincados , tanri , and more ( they are different and fewer in malory ) an early part of the vulgate lancelot also describes in a great detail what made him ( in a translation by norris j initially known only as the nameless white knight ( blanc chevalier ) , clad in silver steel on a white horse , the young lancelot ( claiming to be 18 years old , although it later revealed how he is really only 15 ) arrives in arthur 's kingdom of logres with the lady of the lake to be knighted by the king at her behest the lady gives him a powerful magic ring able to dispel any enchantment ( as his anonymous fairy foster mother also does in chrétien 's version ; later parts of the vulgate lancelot instead retcon this as given to him by guinevere ) , among other enchanted items with various abilities ( including a lance and a sword , a tent , and a mirror ) in the vulgate , the white knight later takes the name of his grandfather , king lancelot , upon discovering his identity in the post-vulgate , where lancelot is no longer the central protagonist , he instead comes to arthur 's court alone and almost defeats the king himself on their first meeting without knowing his identity ( excalibur , meant to be used only for the sake of the kingdom and justice , may be broken either in this fight or the one against king pellinore ) he eventually is made a member of arthur 's elite round table after releasing the king 's nephew gawain from enemy captivity almost immediately upon his arrival , lancelot and the young queen guinevere fall in love through a strange magical connection between them , and one of his adventures in the prose cycles involves saving her from abduction by arthur 's enemy maleagant the maleagant episode actually marked the end of the original , non-cyclic version of the prose lancelot , telling of only his childhood and early youth , before the later much longer versions in malory 's le morte d'arthur , the adulterous relationship is postponed for years , as lancelot 's rescue of the queen from meleagant ( during which , as malory wrote , '' sir launcelot wente to bedde with the quene and toke no force of his hurte honed , but toke his plesaunce and hys lyknge untyll hit was the dawning of the day '' after breaking through the iron bars of her prison chamber with his bare hands ) takes place following the grail quest lancelot 's initial knight-errant style adventures from the vulgate cycle that have been included in malory 's compilation range from proving victorious in a tournament fighting on behalf of king bagdemagus , slaying the mighty villain turquine , who had been holding several of arthur 's knights prisoner , to overcoming a damsel 's betrayal and defending himself unarmed against her husband phelot at one point , he goes mad when he is led to believe that guinevere doubts his love until he is found and healed by the lady of the lake another instance of lancelot temporarily losing his mind occurs during his brief imprisonment by camille , after which he is cured by the lady as well nevertheless , the vulgate lancelot notes that '' for all the knights in the world he was the one most unwilling to hurt any lady or maiden '' eventually , lancelot wins his own castle in britain , known as joyous gard ( a former dolorous gard ) , where he learns his real name and heritage ( on another occasion he disguises himself as the red knight as well ) , also plays a decisive role in the war between arthur and galehaut ( galahaut ) at first , lancelot continues to serve galehaut in his home country of sorelois , where guinevere joins him after lancelot saves her from the bewitched arthur during the '' gwenhwyfach '' episode lancelot becomes one of the most famous knights of the round table , even attested as the best knight in the world in malory 's own episode of sir urry of hungary , as well as an object of desire by many ladies , beginning with the lady of malehaut when he is her captive early on in the vulgate lancelot on one occasion ( as told in the prose lancelot ) , morgan agrees to let lancelot go save gawain if he will return to her immediately afterwards , and then sets him free under the condition that he will not spend any time with either guinevere or galehaut for a year another sorceress , named hellawes , wants him for herself so obsessively that , failing in having him either dead or alive in malory 's chapel perilous episode , she soon herself dies from sorrow princess elaine of corbenic , daughter of the fisher king , also falls in love with him ; she is more successful than the others the ensuing pregnancy results in the birth of his son galahad , whom elaine will send off to grow up without a father and who later emerges as the merlin-prophesied good knight upon his return to the court of camelot , lancelot takes part in the great grail quest the quest is initiated by lancelot 's estranged son , the young teenage galahad , having prevailed over his father in a duel during his own dramatic arrival at camelot , among other acts that proved him as the most perfect knight lancelot also saves the queen from an accusation of murder by poison when he fights as her champion against mador de la porte upon his timely return in another episode included in malory 's version upon receiving a desperate letter from the dying gawain offering him forgiveness and asking for his help in the fight against mordred , lancelot hurries to return to britain with his army , only to hear the news of arthur 's death at salisbury plain ( romance version of the battle of camlann ) in the original from the vulgate mort artu , after mourning his comrades , lancelot 's participation in a victorious war against the young sons of mordred and their briton supporters and saxon allies provides him with partial atonement for his earlier role in the story wyeth - p52.jpg '' lancelot ever ran wild wood from place to place '' file : boys king arthur - n white 's novel the once and future king ( 1958 ) portrays lancelot very differently from his usual image in the legend it follows his journeys , starting as a young child until his arrival in camelot and his meeting with merlyn and arthur pendragon
