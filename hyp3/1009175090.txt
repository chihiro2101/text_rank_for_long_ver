at first , they simply dropped the vocal tracks , but soon more sophisticated effects were created , dropping separate instrumental tracks in and out of the mix , isolating and repeating hooks , and adding various effects like echo , reverberation and delay at first , moulton was simply called upon to improve the aesthetics of dance-oriented recordings before release ( '' i did n't do the remix , i did the mix '' —tom moulton ) in fact his version was a re-edit of the original mix malcolm mclaren and the creative team behind ztt records would feature the '' cut up '' style of hip hop on such records as '' duck rock '' as the cost and availability of new technologies allowed , many of the bands who were involved in their own production ( such as yellow magic orchestra , depeche mode , new order , erasure , and duran duran ) experimented with more intricate versions of the extended mix madonna began her career writing music for dance clubs and used remixes extensively to propel her career ; one of her early boyfriends was noted dj john jellybean benitez , who created several mixes of her work art of noise took the remix styles to an extreme—creating music entirely of samples primarily because they featured sampled and synthesized sounds , yello and art of noise would produce a great deal of influential work for the next phase after the rise of dance music in the late 1980s , a new form of remix was popularised , where the vocals would be kept and the instruments would be replaced , often with matching backing in the house music idiom jesse saunders , known as the originator of house music , was the first producer to change the art of remixing by creating his own original music , entirely replacing the earlier track , then mixing back in the artist 's original lyrics to make his remix another clear example of this approach is roberta flack 's 1989 ballad '' uh-uh ooh-ooh look out ( here it comes ) '' , which chicago house great steve '' silk '' hurley dramatically reworked into a boisterous floor-filler by stripping away all the instrumental tracks and substituting a minimalist , sequenced '' track '' to underpin her vocal delivery , remixed for the uk release which reached no1 pop by simon harris in the 1990s , with the rise of powerful home computers with audio capabilities came the mash-up , an unsolicited , unofficial ( and often legally dubious ) remix created by '' underground remixers '' who edit two or more recordings ( often of wildly different songs ) together girl talk is perhaps the most famous of this movement , creating albums using sounds entirely from other music and cutting it into his own underground mixing is more difficult than the typical official remix because clean copies of separated tracks such as vocals or individual instruments are usually not available to the public some artists ( such as björk , nine inch nails , and public enemy ) embraced this trend and outspokenly sanctioned fan remixing of their work ; there was once a web site which hosted hundreds of unofficial remixes of björk 's songs , all made using only various officially sanctioned mixes some industrial groups allow , and often encourage , their fans to remix their music , notably nine inch nails , whose website contains a list of downloadable songs that can be remixed using apple 's garageband software some artists have started releasing their songs in the u-myx format , which allows buyers to mix songs and share them on the u-myx website '' remixes have become the norm in contemporary dance music , giving one song the ability to appeal across many different musical genres or dance venues the remix is also widely used in hip hop music it usually contains some if not all of the original verses of the song however they may be arranged in a different order than they originally were some artists would contribute new or additional vocals for the different versions of their songs some of the song 's r & b elements were removed for the remix , while the bassline and '' genius of love '' sample were emphasized and the bridge from the original version was used as the chorus '' fantasy '' exemplified how a music sample could be transformed '' into a fully realized pop masterpiece '' due to the success and influence of the song , carey is credited for introducing r & b and hip hop into mainstream pop culture , and for popularizing rap as a featuring act through her post-1995 songs '' john norris of mtv news has stated that the remix was '' responsible for , i would argue , an entire wave of music that we 've seen since and that is the r & b-hip-hop collaboration you could argue that the 'fantasy ' remix was the single most important recording that she 's ever made '' mayard also expressed that '' to this day odb and mariah may still be the best and most random hip hop collaboration of all time '' , citing that due to the record '' fantasy '' , '' r & b and hip hop were the best of step siblings in 2011 , the experimental metal band iwrestledabearonce used the song at the beginning and end of the video '' you know that ai n't them dogs ' real voices '' in addition , the original version 's beginning line '' you remind me of something/i just ca n't think of what it is '' is actually sampled from an older kelly song , '' you remind me of something '' kelly later revealed that he actually wrote '' ignition ( remix ) '' before the purported original version of '' ignition '' , and created the purported original so that the chorus lyric in his alleged remix would make sense madonna 's i 'm breathless featured a remix of '' now i 'm following you '' that was used to segue from the original to '' vogue '' so that the latter could be added to the set without jarring the listener many hip-hop remixes arose either from the need for a pop/r & b singer to add more of an urban , rap edge to one of their slower songs , or from a rapper 's desire to gain more pop appeal by collaborating with an r & b singer thanks to a combination of guest raps , re-sung or altered lyrics and alternative backing tracks , some hip-hop remixes can end up being almost entirely different songs from the originals an example is the remix of '' ai n't it funny '' by jennifer lopez , which has little in common with the original recording apart from the title slow ballads and r & b songs can be remixed by techno producers and djs in order to give the song appeal to the club scene and to urban radio these remixes proved hugely influential , notably lisa stansfield 's classic single '' change '' would be aired by urban radio in the knuckles version , which had been provided as an alternative to the original mix by ian devaney and andy morris , the record 's producers thus the concept of a remix can be applied to visual or video arts , and even things farther afield a remix in art often takes multiple perspectives upon the same theme an artist takes an original work of art and adds their own take on the piece creating something completely different while still leaving traces of the original work the internet has allowed for art to be remixed quite easily , as evidenced by sites like memgenerator.net ( provides pictorial template upon which any words may be written by various anonymous users ) , and dan walsh 's garfieldminusgarfield.net ( removes the main character from various original strips by garfield creator jim davis ) in recent years the concept of the remix has been applied analogously to other media and products remix production is now often involved in media production as a form of parody because remixes may borrow heavily from an existing piece of music ( possibly more than one ) , the issue of intellectual property becomes a concern
