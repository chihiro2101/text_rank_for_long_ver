what is commonly called bark includes a number of different tissues from the outside to the inside of a mature woody stem , the layers include : bark periderm cork ( phellem or suber ) , includes the rhytidome cork cambium ( phellogen ) phelloderm cortex phloem vascular cambium wood ( xylem ) sapwood ( alburnum ) heartwood ( duramen ) pith ( medulla ) in young stems , which lack what is commonly called bark , the tissues are , from the outside to the inside : epidermis , which may be replaced by periderm cortex primary and secondary phloem vascular cambium secondary and primary xylem as the stem ages and grows , changes occur that transform the surface of the stem into the bark the epidermis is a layer of cells that cover the plant body , including the stems , leaves , flowers and fruits , that protects the plant from the outside world this dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree trunks and other stems often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants , which is composed of cork ( phellem ) , the cork cambium ( phellogen ) , and the phelloderm as the stems grow a layer of cells form under the epidermis , called the cork cambium , these cells produce cork cells that turn into cork as the stem grows , the cork cambium produces new layers of cork which are impermeable to gases and water and the cells outside the periderm , namely the epidermis , cortex and older secondary phloem die as the bark develops , new lenticels are formed within the cracks of the cork layers the rhytidome is the most familiar part of bark , being the outer layer that covers the trunks of trees it could be due to this factor that the degradation of lignin is far less pronounced in bark tissue than it is in wood in some plants , the bark is substantially thicker , providing further protection and giving the bark a characteristically distinctive structure with deep ridges in the cork oak ( quercus suber ) the bark is thick enough to be harvested as a cork product without killing the tree ; in this species the bark may get very thick ( e.g bark contains strong fibres known as bast , and there is a long tradition in northern europe of using bark from coppiced young branches of the small-leaved lime ( tilia cordata ) to produce rope and rope , used for example in the rigging of viking age longships such logs and even trunks and branches found in their natural state of decay in forests , where the bark has fallen off , are said to be decorticated bark and wood boring insects in living trees in europe , a synthesis frost crack and sun scald are examples of damage found on tree bark which trees can repair to a degree , depending on the severity file : the_mc_kinney_kauri_borke.jpg kauri bark file : beech tree - recovery from heat damage.jpg beech bark with callus growth following fire ( heat ) damage file : oakholly.jpg damaged bark file : rainbow eucalyptus maui.jpg '' rainbow '' eucalyptus bark on the hawaiian island of maui
