as aerial warfare developed , the allies gained a lead over the germans by introducing machine-gun armed types such as the vickers f.b.5 gunbus fighter and the morane-saulnier l 469 on 18 april 1915 , the morane-saulnier l of roland garros was captured , after he was forced to land behind the german lines in a postwar biography , fokker claimed that he produced the gear in 48hours but it was probably designed by heinrich lübbe , a engineer fokker e.5/15 , the last of the pre-production series , is believed to have been first flown in action by kurt wintgens of ffa6 the claims were not confirmed but research has shown that the first claim matches french records of a morane forced down on 1july near lunéville , with a wounded crew and a damaged engine , followed three days later by another parschau had received the new e.1/15 ( fokker factory serial 191 ) , the initial example of the five fokker m.5k/mg service test examples for the line of aircraft , when the a.16/15 ( green machine ) , he had flown since the beginning of the war , was returned to the fokker flugzeugbau factory in schwerin–gorries for development by the end of july 1915 , about fifteen were operational with various units , including the five m.5k/mgs and about ten early production e.i airframes at first , e.3/15 was jointly allocated to him and immelmann when their '' official '' duties permitted , allowing them to master the type 's difficult handling characteristics and to practice shooting at ground targets immelmann was soon allocated a very early production fokker e.i , e.13/15 , one of the first armed with the lmg 08 ( a lightened version of the mg08 spandau ) machine-gun , using the more reliable production version of the fokker gear the fokker scourge is usually considered by the british to have begun on 1august , when b.e.2cs of 2 squadron royal flying corps ( rfc ) bombed the base of ffa62 at waking the german pilots , including boelcke ( most likely , still with e 3/15 ) and immelmann ( flying e 13/15 ) , who were quickly into the air after the raiders by late october , towards the end of the battle of loos , more fokkers ( including the similar pfalz e-type fighters , which were also called fokkers by allied airmen ) were encountered by rfc pilots and by december , forty fokkers were in service if the british aircraft had not been shot down , the german pilot could climb again and repeat the process rfc losses were exacerbated by the increase in the number of aircraft at the front , from 85 to 161 between march and september , the hard winter of 1915–1916 and some aggressive flying by the new german '' c '' type two-seaters the '' official '' list of claims by fokker pilots for the second half of 1915 was no more than 28 , many of them over french aircraft january 1916 brought thirteen claims , most of them against the french , followed by twenty more in february , the last month of the '' scourge '' proper in his memoir sagittarius rising ( 1936 ) , cecil lewis wrote , on 14 january , rfc hq issued orders that until better aircraft arrived , long and short-range reconnaissance aircraft must have three escorts flying in close formation if contact with the escorts was lost , the reconnaissance must be cancelled , as would photographic reconnaissance to any great distance beyond the front line sending the b.e.2c into action without an observer armed with a lewis gun also became less prevalent 156–157 new defensive formations were devised ; a ii wing rfc method was for the reconnaissance aircraft to lead , escorted on each side higher , with another escort behind and above 147–148 on 7 february , on a iiwing long-range reconnaissance , the observation pilot flew at ; a german aircraft appeared over roulers and seven more closed in behind the formation none of the german pilots attacked and all the british aircraft returned , only to meet two german aircraft coming back from a bombing raid , which opened fire and mortally wounded the pilot of one the escorts during march and april increasing numbers of the new french nieuport 11 fighters were sent to verdun british f.e.2b pusher aircraft had been arriving in france from late 1915 and in the new year began to replace the older f.b.5s fokker pilots attacked the f.e.s without hesitation but soon found that the new aircraft could be formidable opponents , particularly when flying in formation but the f.e 158–159 the nieuports proved even more effective when the first nieuport 16s in british service were issued to 1 and 11 squadrons in april by july 1916 , kek had been formed at vaux , avillers , jametz and cunel near verdun as well as other places on the western front , as ( aerial guard service ) units , consisting only of fighters 9 in late may , german air activity on the british front decreased markedly , while the commander of the new , ( colonel ) hermann von der lieth-thomsen , reorganised the german air service by this time , the last of the , long outmoded as front line fighters , had been retired grey , founder of the aeroplane , one of the first aviation magazines and noel pemberton billing , a royal naval air service ( rnas ) pilot , notably unsuccessful aircraft designer and manufacturer and a member of parliament from march 1916 their supposed object was the replacement of the b.e.2c with better aircraft but it took the form of an attack on the rfc command and the royal aircraft factory grey had orchestrated a campaign against the royal aircraft factory in the pages of the aeroplane , going back to its period as the balloon factory , well before it had produced any heavier-than-air aircraft when the news of the fokker monoplane fighters reached him in late 1915 , grey was quick to blame the problem on orders for equipment that the latest developments had rendered obsolete pemberton billing also blamed the initially poor performance of british aircraft manufacturers on what he saw as the favouritism shown by the rfc , an arm of the british army , towards the royal aircraft factory , which , while nominally civilian , was also part of the army the period of allied air superiority that followed the fokker scourge was brief ; by mid-september 1916 , the first twin-spandau armed albatros d.i fighters were coming into service the new aircraft were again able to challenge allied aircraft , culminating in '' bloody april '' during the battle of arras cheesman 1960 , p german aircraft of the first world war aircraft of world war i : 1914–1918 the war in the air , being the story of the part played in the great war by the royal air force , ( volume ii ) kennett , lee the first air war : 1914–1918 new york , simon & schuster , 1991 white heat : the new warfare 1914–1918
