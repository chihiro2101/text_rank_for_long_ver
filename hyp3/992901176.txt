in all of these techniques , a biomolecule , such as protein or dna , or some other biopolymer has one end bound to a surface and the other to a force sensor the force sensor is usually a micrometre-sized bead or a cantilever , whose displacement can be measured to determine the force typically , the force curves observed in the force spectroscopy experiments consist of a contact ( diagonal ) region where the probe contacts the sample surface , and a non-contact region where the probe is off the sample surface in some cases , binding between the two partners will occur , which will become visible in the force curve , as the use of a flexible linker gives rise to a characteristic curve shape ( see worm-like chain model ) distinct from adhesion the resulting graph of the average rupture force as a function of the loading rate is called the force spectrum and forms the basic dataset for dynamic force spectroscopy in the ideal case of a single sharp energy barrier for the tip-sample interactions the dynamic force spectrum will show a linear increase of the rupture force as function of a logarithm of the loading rate , as described by a model proposed by bell et al a recently developed technique , acoustic force spectroscopy ( afs ) , allows the force manipulation of hundreds of single-molecules and single-cells in parallel , providing high experimental throughput another technique that has been gaining ground for single molecule experiments is the use of optical tweezers for applying mechanical forces on molecules magnetic tweezers can measure femtonewton forces , and additionally they can also be used to apply torsion afs devices allow the statistical analysis of the mechanical properties of biological systems by applying piconewton forces to hundreds of individual particles in parallel , with sub-millisecond response time this is achieved by measuring the position of a bead attached to a dna-protein complex stalled on a dna tether that has one end attached to a surface , while keeping the force constant recently this technique has been used in cell biology to measure the aggregative stochastic forces created by motor proteins that influence the motion of particles within the cytoplasm in this , way force spectrum microscopy may be used better to understand the many cellular processes that require the motion of particles within cytoplasm
