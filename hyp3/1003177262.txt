when he applied a high voltage electrical charge to a coolidge tube that he placed on a scale , brown noticed a difference in the tubes mass depending on orientation , implying some kind of net force on 15 april 1927 , he applied for a patent , entitled '' method of producing force or motion , '' that described his invention as an electrical-based method that could control gravity to produce linear force or motion brown filed another patent in 1960 that detailed the physics of the biefeld–brown effect , making the following claims : there is a negative correlation between the distance between the plates of the capacitor and the strength of the effect , where the shorter the distance , the greater the effect the most effective distance between electrodes occurs at an electric potential gradient of about 10 kv/cm , which is just below the nominal breakdown voltage of air between two sharp points , at a current density level usually referred to as the saturated corona current condition as air pressure is removed from the system , several effects combine to reduce the force and momentum available to the system though the applied voltage and current will propagate at nearly the speed of light , the movement of the conductors themselves is almost negligible it is likely that the reason for this is that at very low pressures , only experiments which used very large voltages produced positive results , as a product of a greater chance of ionization of the extremely limited number of available air molecules , and a greater force from each ion from coulomb 's law ; experiments which used lower voltages have a lower chance of ionization and a lower force per ion common to positive results is that the force observed is small in comparison to experiments conducted at standard pressure around the same time in 2003 , researchers from the army research laboratory ( arl ) tested the biefeld–brown effect by building four different-sized asymmetric capacitors based on simple designs found on the internet and then applying a high voltage of around 30 kv to them according to their report , the researchers wrote that the effects of ion wind was at least three orders of magnitude too small to account for the observed force on the asymmetric capacitor in the air having proposed that the biefeld–brown effect could theoretically be explained using ion drift instead of ion wind due to how the former involves collisions instead of ballistic trajectories , they noted these were only '' scaling estimates '' and more experimental and theoretical work was needed around ten years later , researchers from the technical university of liberec conducted experiments on the biefeld–brown effect that supported one of arl 's hypotheses that assigned ion drift as the most likely source of the generated force in 2004 , martin tajmar published a paper that also failed to replicate brown 's work and suggested that brown may have instead observed the effects of a corona wind triggered by insufficient outgassing of the electrode assembly in the vacuum chamber and therefore misinterpreted the corona wind effects as a possible connection between gravitation and electromagnetism
