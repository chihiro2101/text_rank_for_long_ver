the abnormal heart rhythms seen in brugada syndrome often occur at rest , following a heavy meal , or even during sleep abnormal heart rhythms may also occur during fever or following excessive alcohol as a genetic disorder , the syndrome is ultimately caused by changes to a person 's dna , known as mutation many of the genetic mutations that have subsequently been described in association with brugada syndrome influence the sodium current in some way , or affect other ionic currents a long list of factors that can generate a brugada ecg pattern have been described , including certain medications , electrolyte disturbances such as a hypokalemia , and a ischemia to key areas of the heart , specifically the ventricular outflow tract this variation partially explains the differences in severity of the condition between different persons , ranging from a highly dangerous condition causing death at a young age to a benign condition that may not cause any problems at all however , the genetics of brugada syndrome are complex , and it is likely that the condition results from the interactions of many genes because of these complex interactions , some members of a family who carry a particular mutation may show evidence of brugada syndrome while other carrying the same mutation may not , referred to as variable penetrance those who show more than one cardiac conditions at the same time caused by a single mutation are described as having an 'overlap syndrome ' there are several mechanisms by which the genetic mutations causing this condition might produce these arrhythmias those who support this view ( known as the depolarisation hypothesis ) argue that conduction slowing may explain why arrhythmias in those with brugada syndrome tend to occur in middle age , when other factors such as scarring or fibrosis that accompany old age have exacerbated the tendency to conduction slowing caused by the genetic mutation others suggest that the main cause of arrhythmias is a difference in the electrical properties between the inside ( endocardium ) and outside ( epicardium ) of the heart ( known as the repolarisation hypothesis ) whilst the heart of those with brugada syndrome may look normal , scarring or fibrosis is often seen in particular regions of the heart , specifically the right ventricular outflow tract as brugada syndrome can be caused by mutation in many different genes , it is possible that different mechanisms may be responsible for the arrhythmias seen in different patients these patterns may be present all the time , but may appear only in response to particular drugs ( see below ) , when the person has a fever , during exercise , or as a result of other triggers according to current recommendations , only a type 1 ecg pattern , occurring either spontaneously or in response to medication , can be used to confirm the diagnosis of brugada syndrome as type 2 and 3 patterns are not infrequently seen in persons without the disease precaution must be taken in giving these medications as there is a small risk of causing abnormal heart rhythms to further complicate matters , many frequently occurring variations in the scn5a gene do not cause any problems , and therefore genetic variants are sometimes identified in persons with brugada syndrome that are not truly causing the disease invasive electrophysiology study , in which wires are passed through a vein to stimulate and record electrical signals from the heart , can sometimes be used to assess the risk of a person with brugada syndrome experiencing dangerous abnormal heart rhythms while some with this condition are at high risk of serious heart rhythm disturbances , others are at much lower risk , meaning that some may require more intensive treatment than others the first line of treatment , suitable for all people with brugada syndrome regardless of their risk of arrhythmias , is lifestyle advice although the abnormal heart rhythms seen in brugada syndrome are generally more likely to occur at rest or even during sleep , some people with brugada syndrome experience arrhythmias during strenuous exercise an icd can also function as a pacemaker , preventing abnormally slow heart rates that can also occur in people with brugada syndrome because of the small risk associated with implanting an icd , as well as the cost of the devices , icds are not recommended for all people with brugada syndrome but are instead reserved for people deemed at higher risk of sudden cardiac death it is most frequently used in people with brugada syndrome who have an icd and have experienced several episodes of life-threatening arrhythmias , but may also be used in people at high risk of arrhythmias but in whom an icd is not appropriate
