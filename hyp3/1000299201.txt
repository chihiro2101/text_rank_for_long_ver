cortisol is a major stress hormone and has effects on many tissues in the body , including the brain as well as directly increasing glucose availability , cortisol also suppresses the highly demanding metabolic processes of the immune system , resulting in further availability of glucose glucocorticoids have many important functions , including modulation of stress reactions , but in excess they can be damaging particularly in rodents , it has been shown that females may lack the ability to tolerate as well as process stress ( particularly for chronic stress ) due to possible down regulation of gr expression as well as a deficiency of fkbp51 binding protein in the cytosol by constantly activating the hpa axis , this could lead to higher instances of stress and disorders that would only get worse with chronic stress stressors can be of many different types—in experimental studies in rats , a distinction is often made between '' social stress '' and '' physical stress '' , but both types activate the hpa axis , though via different pathways there is evidence that an increase in oxytocin , resulting for instance from positive social interactions , acts to suppress the hpa axis and thereby counteracts stress , promoting positive health effects such as wound healing for example , biologists studying stress in fish showed that subordinate leads to chronic stress , related to reduced aggression interactions , to impulsivity , and to the constant threat imposed by dominant fish serotonin ( 5ht ) appeared to be the active neurotransmitter involved in mediating stress responses , and increases in serotonin are related to increased blood α-msh levels , which causes skin darkening ( a social signal in salmonoid fish ) , activation of the hpa axis , and inhibition of aggression studies on people show that the hpa axis is activated in different ways during chronic stress depending on the type of stressor , the person 's response to the stressor and other factors it is also known that hpa axis hormones are related to certain skin diseases and skin homeostasis there is evidence shown that the hpa axis hormones can be linked to certain stress related skin diseases and skin tumors in animal experiments , exposure to prenatal stress has been shown to cause a hyper-reactive hpa stress response additionally , they require a longer time for their stress hormone levels to return to baseline following exposure to both acute and prolonged stressors there is growing evidence that prenatal stress can affect hpa regulation in humans in one widely replicated experiment , rats subjected to the moderate stress of frequent human handling during the first two weeks of life had reduced hormonal and behavioral hpa-mediated stress responses as adults , whereas rats subjected to the extreme stress of prolonged periods of maternal separation showed heightened physiological and behavioral stress responses as adults there may be a critical period during development during which the level of stress hormones in the bloodstream contribute to the permanent calibration of the hpa axis one experiment has shown that , even in the absence of any environmental stressors , early-life exposure to moderate levels of corticosterone was associated with stress resilience in adult rats , whereas exposure to high doses was associated with stress vulnerability another possibility is that the effects of early-life stress on hpa functioning are mediated by maternal care for example , increased maternal licking and grooming has been shown to alter expression of the glutocorticoid receptor gene implicated in adaptive stress response at least one human study has identified maternal neural activity patterns in response to video stimuli of mother-infant separation as being associated with decreased glucocorticoid receptor gene methylation in the context of post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from early life stress though animal models allow for more control of experimental manipulation , the effects of early life stress on hpa axis function in humans has also been studied a blunted acth response is common in depression , so the authors of this work posit that this pattern is likely to be due to the participant 's depression and not their exposure to early life stress heim and colleagues have proposed that early life stress , such as childhood abuse , can induce a sensitization of the hpa axis , resulting in particular heightened neuronal activity in response to stress-induced crf release ” maternal stress and differential degrees of caregiving may constitute early life adversity , which has been shown to profoundly influence , if not permanently alter , the offspring 's stress and emotional regulating systems whereas maternal care improves cardiac response , sleep/wake rhythm , and growth hormone secretion in the neonate , it also suppresses hpa axis activity in this manner , maternal care negatively regulates stress response in the neonate , thereby shaping his/her susceptibility to stress in later life glucocorticoids produced by the hpa axis have been proposed to confer either a protective or harmful role , depending on an individual 's genetic predispositions , programming effects of early-life environment , and match or mismatch with one 's postnatal environment specifically , by instating specific patterns of hpa axis activation , the individual may be more well equipped to cope with adversity in a high-stress environment conversely , if an individual is exposed to significant early life adversity , heightened hpa axis reactivity may “ mismatch ” him/her in an environment characterized by low stress the hpa axis plays a clear role in the production of corticosteroids , which govern many facets of brain development and responses to ongoing environmental stress
