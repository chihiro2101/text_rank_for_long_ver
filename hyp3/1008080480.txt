he realized that the filter could be divided into two distinct parts , with one part for time periods between sensor outputs and another part for incorporating measurements this digital filter is sometimes called the stratonovich–kalman–bucy filter because it is a special case of a more general , nonlinear filter developed somewhat earlier by the soviet mathematician ruslan stratonovich , physical laws of motion ) , known control inputs to that system , and multiple sequential measurements ( such as from sensors ) to form an estimate of the system 's varying quantities ( its state ) that is better than the estimate obtained by using only one measurement alone noisy sensor data , approximations in the equations that describe the system evolution , and external factors that are not accounted for all place limits on how well it is possible to determine the system 's state the kalman filter produces an estimate of the state of the system as an average of the system 's predicted state and of the new measurement using a weighted mean the relative certainty of the measurements and current state estimate is an important consideration , and it is common to discuss the response of the filter in terms of the kalman filter 's gain in this example , the kalman filter can be thought of as operating in two distinct phases : predict and update in the prediction phase , the truck 's old position will be modified according to the physical laws of motion ( the dynamic or '' state transition '' model ) along with this measurement comes some amount of uncertainty , and its covariance relative to that of the prediction from the previous phase determines how much the new measurement will affect the updated prediction in most applications , the internal state is much larger ( more degrees of freedom ) than the few '' observable '' parameters which are measured however , by combining a series of measurements , the kalman filter can estimate the entire internal state in the dempster–shafer theory , each state equation or observation is considered a special case of a linear belief function and the kalman filter is a special case of combining linear belief functions on a join-tree or markov tree at each discrete time increment , a linear operator is applied to the state to generate the new state , with some noise mixed in , and optionally some information from the controls on the system if they are known the kalman filter may be regarded as analogous to the hidden markov model , with the key difference that the hidden state variables take values in a continuous space as opposed to a discrete state space as in the hidden markov model chapter 13 , 'the kalman filter ' in order to use the kalman filter to estimate the internal state of a process given only a sequence of noisy observations one must model the process in accordance with the following framework the kalman filter model assumes the true state at time k is evolved from the state at ( k & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 1 ) according to : \mathbf the update equations are identical to those of the discrete-time kalman filter attitude and heading reference systems autopilot battery state of charge ( soc ) estimation brain-computer interfaces chaotic signals tracking and vertex fitting of charged particles in particle detectors tracking of objects in computer vision dynamic positioning in shipping economics , in particular macroeconomics , time series analysis , and econometrics inertial guidance system nuclear medicine – single photon emission computed tomography image restoration orbit determination power system state estimation radar tracker satellite navigation systems seismology sensorless control of ac motor variable-frequency drives simultaneous localization and mapping speech enhancement visual odometry weather forecasting navigation system 3d modeling structural health monitoring human sensorimotor processing
