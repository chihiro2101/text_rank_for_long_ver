he wrote some of his most important works there in other writings , comenius addresses both instrumental and vocal music in many places , although he dedicated no treatise to the topic sometimes he follows the medieval mathematical conception of music , but in other places he links music with grammar , rhetoric , and politics few men since his days have had a greater influence though , for the greater part of the eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth , there was little recognition of his relationship to the current advance in educational thought and practice he was first a teacher and an organizer of schools , not only among his own people , but later in sweden , and to a slight extent in holland in his didactica magna ( great didactic ) , he outlined a system of schools that is the exact counterpart of the existing american system of kindergarten , elementary school , secondary school , college , and university in the second place , the influence of comenius was in formulating the general theory of education , and is the first to formulate that idea of '' education according to nature '' so influential during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century in fact , he was largely influenced by the thought of these two ;

( 2 ) obtaining ideas through objects rather than words ; ( 3 ) starting with objects most familiar to the child to introduce him to both the new language and the more remote world of objects ; ( 4 ) giving the child a comprehensive knowledge of his environment , physical and social , as well as instruction in religious , moral , and classical subjects ; ( 5 ) making this acquisition of a compendium of knowledge a pleasure rather than a task ; and ( 6 ) making instruction universal the importance of the comenian influence in education has been recognized since the middle of the nineteenth century in 1892 the three-hundredth anniversary of comenius was very generally celebrated by educators , and at that time the comenian society for the study and publication of his works was formed one of his most famous theological works is the labyrinth of the world and paradise of the heart gate to languages , a project of lifelong education , taking place in the czech republic from october 2005 to june 2007 and aimed at language education of teachers , was named after his book janua linguarum reserata ( gate to languages unlocked ) comenius ' name has been given to primary schools in several german cities , including bonn , grafing , and deggendorf it was the first university with courses in the slovak language in the united kingdom , the university of sheffield 's western bank library holds the largest collection of comenius manuscripts outside of the czech republic in 1892 educators in many places celebrated the three-hundredth anniversary of comenius , and at that time the comenian society for the study and publication of his works was formed new international encyclopedia the education department at salem college in north carolina has an annual comenius symposium dedicated in his honor ;
