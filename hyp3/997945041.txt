there are two basic types of transmembrane proteins : alpha-helix and beta-barrels alpha-helical proteins in outer membranes include stannin and certain lipoproteins , and others this is the major category of transmembrane proteins in humans , 27 % of all proteins have been estimated to be alpha-helical membrane proteins in addition to the protein domains , there are unusual transmembrane elements formed by peptides type i transmembrane proteins are anchored to the lipid membrane with a stop-transfer anchor sequence and have their n-terminal domains targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) lumen during synthesis ( and the extracellular space , if mature forms are located on cell membranes ) the most common tertiary structures of these proteins are transmembrane helix bundle and beta barrel the portion of the membrane proteins that are attached to the lipid bilayer ( see annular lipid shell ) consist mostly of hydrophobic amino acids hence , despite the significant functional importance of membrane proteins , determining atomic resolution structures for these proteins is more difficult than globular proteins they include : ompa-like transmembrane domain ( ompa ) virulence-related outer membrane protein family ( ompx ) outer membrane protein w family ( ompw ) antimicrobial peptide resistance and lipid a acylation protein family ( pagp ) lipid a deacylase pagl opacity family porins ( nspa ) autotransporter domain ( n 12 , s 14 ) fadl outer membrane protein transport family , including fatty acid transporter fadl ( n 14 , s 14 ) general bacterial porin family , known as trimeric porins ( n 16 , s 20 ) maltoporin , or sugar porins ( n 18 , s 22 ) nucleoside-specific porin ( n 12 , s 16 ) outer membrane phospholipase a1 ( n 12 , s 16 ) tonb-dependent receptors and their plug domain they are ligand-gated outer membrane channels ( n 22 , s 24 ) , including cobalamin transporter btub , fe ( iii ) -pyochelin receptor fpta , receptor fepa , ferric hydroxamate uptake receptor fhua , transporter feca , and pyoverdine receptor fpva outer membrane protein opca family ( n 10 , s 12 ) that includes outer membrane protease ompt and outer membrane protein opca outer membrane protein g porin family ( n 14 , s 16 ) note : n and s are , respectively , the number of beta-strands and the '' shear number '' of the beta-barrel trimeric autotransporter ( n 12 , s 12 ) outer membrane efflux proteins , also known as trimeric outer membrane factors ( n 12 , s 18 ) including tolc and multidrug resistance proteins mspa porin ( octamer , n s 16 ) and Î±-hemolysin ( heptamer n s 14 )
