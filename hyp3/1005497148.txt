plethon admired plato ( greek : plátōn ) so much that late in life he took the similar-meaning name plethon plethon is also an archaic translation of the greek γεμιστός gemistós ( '' full , stuffed '' ) some time before 1410 , emperor manuel ii paleologus sent him to mistra in the despotate of morea in the southern peloponnese , which remained his home for the rest of his life he produced his major writings during his time in italy and after his return in 1428 pletho was consulted by emperor john viii on the issue of unifying the greek and latin churches , and advised that both delegations should have equal voting power byzantine scholars had been in contact with their counterparts in western europe since the time of the latin empire , and especially since the byzantine empire had begun to ask for western european help against the ottomans in the 14th century western europe had some access to ancient greek philosophy through the catholic church and the muslims , but the byzantines had many documents and interpretations that the westerners had never seen before ( debolt ) and he essentially reintroduced much of plato to the western world , shaking the domination which aristotle had come to exercise over western european thought in the high and later middle ages in fact , communication between pletho and cosimo de ' medici - for whose meeting there is no independent evidence - would have been severely constrained by the language barrier hanegraaff p.41 nevertheless , pletho came to be considered one of the most important influences on the italian renaissance monfasani ( the difference between the two dates being significant as to whether or not plethon still lived to know of the fall of constantinople in 1453 ) in his 1415 and 1418 pamphlets he urged manuel ii and his son theodore to turn the peninsula into a cultural island with a new constitution of strongly centralised monarchy advised by a small body of middle-class educated men plethon touched little on religion , although he expressed disdain for monks , who '' render no service to the common good '' in de differentiis plethon compares aristotle 's and plato 's conceptions of god , arguing that plato credits god with more exalted powers as '' creator of every kind of intelligible and separate substance , and hence of our entire universe '' , while aristotle has god as only the motive force of the universe ; plato 's god is also the end and final cause of existence , while aristotle 's god is only the end of movement and change plethon derides aristotle for discussing unimportant matters such as shellfish and embryos while failing to credit god with creating the universe , for believing the heavens are composed of a fifth element , and for his view that contemplation was the greatest pleasure ; the latter aligned him with epicurus , plethon argued , and he attributed this same pleasure-seeking to monks , whom he accused of laziness later , in response to gennadius ' defence of aristotle , plethon argued in his reply that plato 's god was more consistent with christian doctrine than aristotle 's , and this , according to darien debolt , was probably in part an attempt to escape suspicion of heterodoxy plethon believed the universe has no beginning or end in time , and being created perfect , nothing may be added to it he rejected the concept of a brief reign of evil followed by perpetual happiness , and held that the human soul is reincarnated , directed by the gods into successive bodies to fulfill divine order the gods are responsible for much good and no evil , and guide all life towards divine order by having manuscripts brought from greece and becoming the patron of '' the young boy , ficino , '' cosimo facilitated the preservation and transmission of greek cultural patrimony into the modern world after the fall of constantinople in 1453 plethon thus played a key but hidden role in the italian renaissance
