thumb digital signal processing algorithms typically require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly and repeatedly on a series of data samples many dsp applications have constraints on latency ; that is , for the system to work , the dsp operation must be completed within some fixed time , and deferred ( or batch ) processing is not viable such performance improvements have led to the introduction of digital signal processing in commercial communications satellites where hundreds or even thousands of analog filters , switches , frequency converters and so on are required to receive and process the uplinked signals and ready them for downlinking , and can be replaced with specialised dsps with significant benefits to the satellites ' weight , power consumption , complexity/cost of construction , reliability and flexibility of operation most also support some of the features as an applications processor or microcontroller , since signal processing is rarely the only task of a system by the standards of general-purpose processors , dsp instruction sets are often highly irregular ; while traditional instruction sets are made up of more general instructions that allow them to perform a wider variety of operations , instruction sets optimized for digital signal processing contain instructions for common mathematical operations that occur frequently in dsp calculations one implication for software architecture is that hand-optimized assembly-code routines ( assembly programs ) are commonly packaged into libraries for re-use , instead of relying on advanced compiler technologies to handle essential algorithms multiple arithmetic units may require memory architectures to support several accesses per instruction cycle -- typically supporting reading 2 data values from 2 separate data buses and the next instruction ( from the instruction cache , or a 3rd program memory ) simultaneously hardware is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the ( electronic computer ) hardware from the software that runs on it also , modern aircraft can not function without running tens of millions of computer instructions embedded and distributed throughout the aircraft and resident in both standard computer hardware and in specialized hardware components such as ic wired logic gates , analog and hybrid devices , and other digital components the need to effectively model how separate physical components combine to form complex systems is important over a wide range of applications , including computers , personal digital assistants ( pdas ) , cell phones , surgical instrumentation , satellites , and submarines dsps are usually optimized for streaming data and use special memory architectures that are able to fetch multiple data or instructions at the same time , such as the harvard architecture or modified von neumann architecture , which use separate program and data memories ( sometimes even concurrent access on multiple data buses ) operating systems that use virtual memory require more time for context switching among processes , which increases latency prior to the advent of stand-alone digital signal processor ( dsp ) chips , early digital signal processing applications were typically implemented using bit-slice chips another important development in digital signal processing was data compression the ami s2811 '' signal processing peripheral '' , like many later dsps , has a hardware multiplier that enables it to do multiply–accumulate operation in a single instruction some chips , like the motorola mc68356 , even included more than one processor core to work in parallel modern signal processors yield greater performance ; this is due in part to both technological and architectural advancements like lower design rules , fast-access two-level cache , ( e ) dma circuitry and a wider bus system texas instruments produces the c6000 series dsps , which have clock speeds of 1.2 & nbsp ; ghz and implement separate instruction and data caches the top models are capable of as many as 8000 mips ( millions of instructions per second ) , use vliw ( very long instruction word ) , perform eight operations per clock-cycle and are compatible with a broad range of external peripherals and various buses ( pci/serial/etc ) xmos produces a multi-core multi-threaded line of processor well suited to dsp operations , they come in various speeds ranging from 400 to 1600 mips the processors have a multi-threaded architecture that allows up to 8 real-time threads per core , meaning that a 4 core device would support up to 32 real time threads as a result , these processors can run simple operating systems like μclinux , velocity and nucleus rtos while operating on real-time data in some products the dsp core is hidden as a fixed-function block into a soc , but nxp also provides a range of flexible single core media processors introduced in 2004 , the dspic is designed for applications needing a true dsp as well as a true microcontroller , such as motor control and in power supplies generally , dsps are dedicated integrated circuits ; however dsp functionality can also be produced by using field-programmable gate array chips ( fpgas ) in communications a new breed of dsps offering the fusion of both dsp functions and h/w acceleration function is making its way into the mainstream
