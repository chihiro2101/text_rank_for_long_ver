in the us , mains electric power is referred to by several names including '' utility power '' , '' household power '' , '' household electricity '' , '' house current '' , '' powerline '' , '' domestic power '' , '' wall power '' , '' line power '' , '' ac power '' , '' city power '' , '' street power '' for a list of voltages , frequencies , and wall plugs by country , see mains electricity by country worldwide , many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting regions in an effective state of anarchy may have no central electrical authority , with electric power provided by incompatible private sources direct current ( dc ) has been almost completely displaced by alternating current ( ac ) in public power systems , but dc was used especially in some city areas to the end of the 20th century industrial plants with three-phase power will have different , higher voltages installed for large equipment ( and different sockets and plugs ) , but the common voltages listed here would still be found for lighting and portable equipment cenelec harmonisation document hd 472 s1:1988 british standard bs 7697 : nominal voltages for low voltage public electricity supply systems – ( implementation of hd 472 s1 ) no change in voltage was required by either the central european or the uk system , as both 220 & thinsp ; v and 240 & thinsp ; v fall within the lower 230 & nbsp ; v tolerance bands ( 230 & nbsp ; v ±6 % ) in practice , this allowed countries to have supplied the same voltage ( 220 or 240 & thinsp ; v ) , at least until existing supply transformers are replaced in the united states ansi c84.1 : american national standard for electric power systems and equipment – voltage ratings ( 60 hertz ) , nema ( costs 95 for access ) and canada , csa can3-c235-83 : preferred voltage levels for ac systems , 0 to 50 & thinsp ; 000 & nbsp ; v national standards specify that the nominal voltage at the source should be 120 & nbsp ; v and allow a range of 114 & nbsp ; v to 126 & nbsp ; v ( rms ) ( −5 % to +5 % ) ac systems started appearing in the us in the mid-1880s , using higher distribution voltage stepped down via transformers to the same 110 & nbsp ; v customer utilization voltage that edison used ac circuits adopted the same form during the war of the currents , allowing lamps to be run at around 110 & nbsp ; v and major appliances to be connected to 220 & nbsp ; v in 1899 , the berliner elektrizitäts-werke ( bew ) , a berlin electrical utility , decided to greatly increase its distribution capacity by switching to 220 & nbsp ; v nominal distribution , taking advantage of the higher voltage capability of newly developed metal filament lamps 193 in the first decade after the introduction of alternating current in the us ( from the early 1880s to about 1893 ) a variety of different frequencies were used , with each electric provider setting their own , so that no single one prevailed around 1893 the westinghouse electric company in the united states and aeg in germany decided to standardize their generation equipment on 60 & nbsp ; hz and 50 & nbsp ; hz respectively , eventually leading to most of the world being supplied at one of these two frequencies to maintain the voltage at the customer 's service within the acceptable range , electrical distribution utilities use voltage regulator at electrical substations or along the distribution line for long ( several kilometres ) rural distribution circuits , automatic voltage regulators may be mounted on poles of the distribution line
