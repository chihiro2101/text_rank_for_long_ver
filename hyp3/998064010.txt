in a phase space , every degree of freedom or parameter of the system is represented as an axis of a multidimensional space ; a one-dimensional system is called a phase line , while a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane for every possible state of the system or allowed combination of values of the system 's parameters , a point is included in the multidimensional space within the context of a model system in classical mechanics , the phase space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system 's dynamic variables one degree of freedom occurs when one has an autonomous ordinary differential equation in a single variable , dy/dt f ( y ) , with the resulting one-dimensional system being called a phase line , and the qualitative behaviour of the system being immediately visible from the phase line the phase space of a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane , which occurs in classical mechanics for a single particle moving in one dimension , and where the two variables are position and velocity however the latter expression , '' phase diagram '' , is more usually reserved in the physical sciences for a diagram showing the various regions of stability of the thermodynamic phases of a chemical system , which consists of pressure , temperature , and composition if a thermodynamic system consists of n particles , then a point in the 6n-dimensional phase space describes the dynamic state of every particle in that system , as each particle is associated with three-position variables and three momentum variables the phase space can also refer to the space that is parameterized by the macroscopic states of the system , such as pressure , temperature , etc when used in this sense , a phase is a region of phase space where the system in question is in , for example , the liquid phase , or solid phase , etc in classical statistical mechanics ( continuous energies ) the concept of phase space provides a classical analog to the partition function ( sum over states ) known as the phase integral instead of summing the boltzmann factor over discretely spaced energy states ( defined by appropriate integer quantum numbers for each degree of freedom ) one may integrate over continuous phase space once the phase integral is known , it may be related to the classical partition function by multiplication of a normalization constant representing the number of quantum energy states per unit phase space
