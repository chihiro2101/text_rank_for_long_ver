kostrikin was able to prove in 1958 that among the finite groups with a given number of generators and a given prime exponent , there exists a largest one clearly , every finite group is periodic however , the orders of the elements of this group are not a priori bounded by a single constant part of the difficulty with the general burnside problem is that the requirements of being finitely generated and periodic give very little information about the possible structure of a group if g is a finitely generated group with exponent n , is g necessarily finite ? it turns out that this problem can be restated as a question about the finiteness of groups in a particular family , x m , and any group g with m generators of exponent n is obtained from it by imposing additional relations for which positive integers m , n is the free burnside group b ( m , n ) finite ? the full solution to burnside problem in this form is not known burnside considered some easy cases in his original paper : b ( 1 , n ) is the cyclic group of order n the particular case of b ( 2 , 5 ) remains open : it was not known whether this group is finite using a complicated combinatorial argument , they demonstrated that for every odd number n with n > 4381 , there exist infinite , finitely generated groups of exponent n moreover , the word and conjugacy problems were shown to be effectively solvable in b ( m , n ) both for the cases of odd and even exponents n in 1982 ol'shanskii was able to strengthen his results to establish existence , for any sufficiently large prime number p ( one can take p > 10 75 ) of a finitely generated infinite group in which every nontrivial proper subgroup is a cyclic group of order p if it is known that a group g with m generators and exponent n is finite , can one conclude that the order of g is bounded by some constant depending only on m and n ? equivalently , are there only finitely many finite groups with m generators of exponent n , up to isomorphism ? this variant of the burnside problem can also be stated in terms of certain universal groups with m generators and exponent n the restricted burnside problem then asks whether b 0 ( m , n ) is a finite group
