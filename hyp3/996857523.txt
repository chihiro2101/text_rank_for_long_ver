juveniles have a similar appearance to adult worms , but are significantly smaller once the larva is established in the proboscis and the fly takes its next human blood meal , the cycle of infection continues usually , about 5 months are needed for larvae ( transferred from a fly ) to mature into adult worms , which they can only do inside the human body the most common display of infection is the localized allergic inflammations called calabar or cameroon swellings that signify the migration of the adult worm in the tissues away from the injection site by the vector loa are asymptomatic , symptoms generally do not appear until years , or even more than a decade , after the bite from an infected fly the most visual sign of an adult worm infections is when the worm crosses the sclera of the eye , which causes significant pain to the host and is usually associated with inflammation and less likely , blindness travelers can be infected in less than 30 days after arriving in an affected area , although they are more likely to be infected whilst being bitten by multiple deerflies over the course of many months the main methods of diagnosis include the presence of microfilariae in the blood , the presence of a worm in the eye , and the presence of skin swellings patients with infections have a higher number of blood cells , namely eosinophils , as well as high ige levels that indicate an active infection with helminth parasites due to the migration of microfilariae during the day , the accuracy of a blood test can be increased when samples are taken between 10 am and 2 pm dec is chosen over ivermectin because evidence supports its ability to kill both the adult worms and the microfilariae , which are the main cause of the severe neurological problems mentioned above in some cases , albendazole may also be an effective treatment used to reduce the microfilariae prior to treatment with dec however , diethylcarbamazine treatment is suggested to reduce risk of infection avoiding areas where the vectors , deer and mango flies , are found also reduces risk also , using malaria nets can reduce the number of fly bites acquired of the 10 countries that have high rates of infection , about 40 % of the people who live in the area have reported being infected with the worm in the past a study conducted by the research foundation in tropical diseases and environment in 2002 had a sample of 1458 persons , spanning 16 different villages , and found loa loa presence in these villages ranging from 2.22 to 19.23 % of the population in the western part of africa , an increase in prevalence has been associated with the distribution of ivermectin , which is used to prevent the infection of onchocerciasis , which is also very prevalent in the same region in the subjects viewed , peripheral blood microfilariae were detected 61.4 % of the time , eye worm migration 53.5 % of the time , and calabar swellings 41.6 % of the time eye worm migration was observed in a similar proportion between the two groups
