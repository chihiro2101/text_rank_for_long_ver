for a time he considered the possibility of a singing career , and was instructed by a vocal coach from the metropolitan opera who provided lessons for free because the family did not have the money for them from an early age , reines exhibited an interest in science , and liked creating and building things he later recalled that : the first stirrings of interest in science that i remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school , when , looking out of the window at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope , i noticed something peculiar about the light ; it was the phenomenon of diffraction ironically , reines excelled in literary and history courses , but received average or low marks in science and math in his freshman year of high school , though he improved in those areas by his junior and senior years through the encouragement of a teacher who gave him a key to the school laboratory publication of the thesis was delayed until after the end of world war ii ; it appeared in physical review in 1946 in 1944 richard feynman recruited reines to work in the theoretical division at the manhattan project 's los alamos laboratory , where he would remain for the next fifteen years an outgrowth of the '' demon core second incident '' experiment , the dragon was a machine that could attain a critical state for short bursts of time , which could be used as a research tool or power source he studied the effects of nuclear blasts , and co-authored a paper with john von neumann on mach stem formation , an important aspect of an air blast wave at the conclusion of the greenhouse test series , reines had received permission from the head of t division , j carson mark , for a leave in residence to study fundamental physics although a less intense source of neutrinos , it had the advantage in allowing for multiple experiments to be carried out over a long period of time in 1953 , they made their first attempts using one of the large reactors at the hanford nuclear site in what is now known as the cowanâ€“reines neutrino experiment '' from then on reines dedicated the major part of his career to the study of the neutrino 's properties and interactions , which work would influence study of the neutrino for future researchers to come on the basis of his work in first detecting the neutrino , reines became the head of the physics department of case western reserve university from 1959 to 1966 in 1966 , reines took most of his neutrino research team with him when he left for the new university of california , irvine ( uci ) , becoming its first dean of physical sciences at uci , reines extended the research interests of some of his graduate students into the development of medical radiation detectors , such as for measuring total radiation delivered to the whole human body in radiation therapy expected cross section from measurements of fission fragment electron spectrum '' , los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) ( through predecessor agency los alamos scientific laboratory ) , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( june 1958 ) '' neutrino experiments at reactors '' , university of california-irvine , case western reserve university , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( september 9 , 1968 ) '' status and aims of the dumand neutrino project : the ocean as a neutrino detector '' , fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fnal ) , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the energy research and development administration ) , ( july 1976 )
