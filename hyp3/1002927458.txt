kritisch redigirter text , frankfort-on-the-main , 1894 ( the edition , however , by no means represents a critical text ) some scholars believe it might have an early medieval origin , while others emphasize earlier traditions appearing in the book according to the jewish encyclopedia , the essential elements of the book are characteristic of the 3rd or 4th century ; for a work of this nature , composed in the geonim period could have been cast only in the form of jewish gnosis , which remained stationary after the 4th century , if indeed it had not already become extinct benton , the hebrew grammatical form places its origin closer to the period of the mishnah , around the 2nd century ce the date and origin of the book can not be definitely determined so long as there is no critical text of it the editio princeps ( mantua , 1562 ) contains two recensions , which were used in the main by the commentators of the book as early as the middle of the 10th century the longer recension , on the other hand , was little known , the form given in the editio princeps of the sefer yetzirah being probably a copy of the text found in donnolo 's commentary although the longer recension doubtless contains additions and interpolations which did not form part of the original text , it has many valuable readings which seem older and better than the corresponding passages in the shorter version , so that a critical edition of the text must consider both recensions it may even be said that this work had a greater influence on the development of the jewish mind than almost any other book after the completion of the talmud a book of the same name was circulated among the ashkenazi hasidim between the 11th and 13th centuries , for whom it became a source of practical kabbalah this book seems to be a mystic work on the six days of creation , and corresponded in part to the small midrash , seder rabbah debereshit sefer yetzirah describes how the universe was created by the '' god of israel '' ( a list of all of god 's hebrew names appears in the first sentence of the book ) through '' 32 wondrous ways of wisdom '' : ten numbers ( sefirot , the origin for the sefirot of later kabbalah ) the twenty-two letters of the hebrew alphabet— three '' mother '' letters ( aleph , mem , shin ) seven '' doubles '' ( bet , gimel , dalet , kaph , pe , resh , taw ) twelve '' simples '' or '' elementals '' ( he , waw , zayin , heth , teth , yodh , lamedh , nun , samekh , ayin , tsade , qoph ) these divisions correspond to jewish concepts such as the 3 letters making up god 's name ( yud , he , and vav ) , the 7 days of the jewish week , the 12 tribes of israel , and the 12 months of the hebrew calendar , as well as to early '' scientific '' or philosophical ideas such as the 4 elements ( fire , water , air , earth ) , the 7 planets , 10 directions , the 12 zodiacal constellations , various human physical functions , and a list of the parts of the human body the book describes how god used the 10 sefirot and the 22 hebrew letters in various combinations , and finally ( as described in the closing section of the book ) , how he revealed this secret to abraham as a covenant with him god 's covenant with abraham is described as being two-fold : between the 10 toes of the feet is the '' covenant of the circumcision '' ( mila in hebrew , which also means '' word '' ) between the 10 fingers of the hands ( also identified with the 10 sephirot ) is the '' covenant of the tongue '' ( lashon in hebrew , which also means '' language '' ) the last sentence describes how god '' connects '' the 22 letters of the torah to abraham 's tongue , and reveals its secret to abraham in contrast to the jewish grammarians , who assumed a special mode of articulation for each of the five groups of sounds , the sefer yetzirah says that no sound can be produced without the tongue , to which the other organs of speech merely lend assistance 1 ) besides these three letters , which are called '' mothers , '' a distinction is also drawn between the seven '' double '' letters , which have two different sounds according to inflection , and the twelve '' simple '' letters , the remaining characters of the alphabet which represent only one sound each both the macrocosm ( the universe ) and the microcosm ( man ) are viewed in this system as products of the combination and permutation of these mystic characters , and such a use of the letters by the jews for the formation of the holy name for thaumaturgy purposes is attested by magic papyri that quote an '' angelic book of moses , '' which was full of allusions to bible names in the beginning , however , these three substances had only a potential existence , and came into actual being only by means of the three letters aleph , mem , shin ; and as these are the principal parts of speech , so those three substances are the elements from which the cosmos has been formed the twelve '' simple '' letters created the twelve signs of the zodiac , whose relation to the earth is always simple or stable ; and to them belong the twelve months in time , and the twelve '' leaders '' in man their name is possibly derived from the fact that as numbers express only the relations of two objects to each other , so the ten sefirot are only abstractions and not realities besides these abstract ten sefirot , which are conceived only ideally , the twenty-two letters of the alphabet produced the material world , for they are real , and are the formative powers of all existence and development this is , then , a modified form of the talmudic doctrine that god created heaven and earth by means of letters ( berachot 58a ) the explanation on this point is obscure since the relation of the twenty-two letters to the ten sefirot is not clearly defined while the sefirot are expressly designated as '' abstracts '' , it is said of the letters : '' twenty-two letters : god drew them , hewed them , combined them , weighed them , interchanged them , and through them produced the whole creation and everything that is destined to come into being '' ( ii as the sefer yetzirah divides the hebrew alphabet into three groups , so the gnostic marcus divided the greek letters into three classes , regarded by him as the symbolic emanations of the three powers which include the whole number of the upper elements the clementine writings present another form of gnosis which agrees in many points with the sefer yetzirah as in the latter , god is not only the beginning but also the end of all things , so in the former he is the ἀρχή ( ראשית ) and τέλος ( תכלית ) of all that exists ; and the clementine writings furthermore teach that the spirit of god is transformed into πνεῦμα ( רוח ) , and this into water , which becomes fire and rocks , thus agreeing with the sefer yetzirah , where the spirit of god , רוח ( πνεῦμα ) , air , water , and fire are the first four sefirot the '' dragon '' ( תלי tli , perhaps meaning '' curled one '' as a coiled serpent ) which plays such an important part in the astrology of the book , is probably an ancient semitic figure ; at all events its name is not arabic , as scholars have hitherto assumed , but either aramaic or possibly a babylonian loan-word
