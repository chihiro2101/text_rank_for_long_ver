two of his brothers attained some distinction : gilles boileau , the author of a translation of epictetus ; and jacques boileau , who became a canon of the sainte-chapelle , and made valuable contributions to church history such of boileau 's early poems as have been preserved hardly contain the promise of what he ultimately became the first piece in which his peculiar powers were displayed was the first satire ( 1660 ) , in imitation of the third satire of juvenal ; it embodied the farewell of a poet to the city of paris in the first place the author skilfully parodies and attacks writers who at the time were placed in the very first rank , such as jean chapelain , the abbé charles cotin , philippe quinault and georges de scudéry ; he openly raised the standard of revolt against the older poets though fairly widely read in manuscript and also released in an unauthorized edition in 1668 , the book was not published till 1713 , out of regard , it is said , for mlle de scudéry to molière and racine he proved a constant friend , and supported their interests on many occasions of the four books of l'art poétique , the first and last consist of general precepts , inculcating mainly the great rule of bon sens ; the second treats of the pastoral , the elegy , the ode , the epigram and satire ; and the third of tragic and epic poetry boileau himself , a great , though , by no means infallible critic in verse , can not be considered a great poet the lutrin , a mock heroic poem , of which four cantos appeared in 1674 , is sometimes said to have furnished alexander pope with a model for the rape of the lock , but the english poem is superior in richness of imagination and subtlety of invention the fifth and sixth cantos , afterwards added by boileau , rather detract from the beauty of the poem ; the last canto in particular is quite unworthy of his genius in 1674 boileau published his translation of longinus ' on the sublime , making longinus ' ideas available to a wider audience , and influencing edmund burke 's work on the same subject antoine arnauld in the year of his death wrote a letter in defence of boileau , but when at the desire of his friends he submitted his reply to bossuet , the bishop pronounced all satire to be incompatible with the spirit of christianity , and the 10th satire to be subversive of morality he holds a well-defined place in french literature , as the first who reduced its versification to rule , and taught the value of workmanship for its own sake his influence on english literature , through pope and his contemporaries , was not less strong , though less durable
