according to gao ( 2010 ) , china has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning , especially the english language he is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about methods for teaching languages the study of latin gradually diminished from the study of a living language to a mere subject in the school curriculum it was then claimed that the study of latin developed intellectual ability , and the study of latin grammar became an end in and of itself based on the purely academic study of latin , students of modern languages did much of the same exercises , studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences they worked on setting language teaching principles and approaches based on linguistic and psychological theories , but they left many of the specific practical details for others to devise the history of foreign-language education in the 20th century and the methods of teaching ( such as those related below ) might appear to be a history of failure even the '' reading knowledge '' required for a phd degree is comparable only to what second-year language students read , and only very few researchers who are native english speakers can read and assess information written in languages other than english however , anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find , leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of most language programs older methods and approaches such as the grammar translation method and the direct method are dismissed and even ridiculed , as newer methods and approaches are invented and promoted as the only and complete solution to the problem of the high failure rates of foreign language students most books on language teaching list the various methods that have been used in the past , often ending with the author 's new method these new methods are usually presented as coming only from the author 's mind , as the authors generally give no credence to what was done before and do not explain how it relates to the new method for example , descriptive linguists seem to claim unhesitatingly that there were no scientifically based language teaching methods before their work ( which led to the audio-lingual method developed for the u.s & nbsp ; 5 ) there have been two major branches in the field of language learning , the empirical and theoretical , and these have almost completely separate histories , with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another over time , language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world in some countries , such as the united states , language education ( also referred to as world languages ) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as english , maths and science english as a second language ( esl ) is also available for students whose first language is not english and they are unable to speak it to the required standard language education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized language school a method is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned , and should be based upon a selected approach examples of interactive methods include the direct method , the series method , communicative language teaching , language immersion , the silent way , suggestopedia , the natural approach , tandem language learning , total physical response , teaching proficiency through reading and storytelling and dogme language teaching also , various other '' language learning tools '' have been entering the market in recent years for example , various travel guides , for example lonely planet , offer software supporting language education language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at language schools across australasia , 'education perfect ' â€“ an online learning site- is frequently used as it enables teachers to monitor students ' progress as students gain a '' point '' for every new word remembered many other websites are helpful for learning languages , even though they are designed , maintained and marketed for other purposes : all countries have websites in their own languages , which learners elsewhere can use as primary material for study : news , fiction , videos , songs , etc in a study conducted by the center for applied linguistics , it was noted that the use of technology and media has begun to play a heavy role in facilitating language learning in the classroom in 2005 , the virtual world second life started to be used for foreign language tuition , sometimes with entire businesses being developed language learning strategies have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition many people read to understand but the strategy of reading text to learn grammar and discourse styles can also be employed language learners can gain experience in speaking foreign languages through in-person language classes , language meet-ups , university language exchange programs , joining online language learning communities ( e.g ease of learning helps one build the confidence and learning esperanto , as a learning strategy , constitutes a good introduction to foreign language study blended learning combines face-to-face teaching with distance education , frequently electronic , either computer-based or web-based it has been a major growth point in the elt ( english language teaching ) industry over the last ten years some people , though , use the phrase 'blended learning ' to refer to learning taking place while the focus is on other activities when talking about language skills , the four basic ones are : listening , speaking , reading and writing in addition , more general learning skills such as study skills and knowing how one learns have been applied to language classrooms in the 1970s and 1980s , the four basic skills were generally taught in isolation in a very rigid order , such as listening before speaking however , since then , it has been recognized that we generally use more than one skill at a time , leading to more integrated exercises there are numerous texts on teaching and testing writing but relatively few on speaking it differs from literal translation and interlinear text as used in the past since it takes the progress learners have made into account and only focuses upon a specific structure at a time that is to say , the capability of using code switching , relating to the transformation of phonetics , words , language structure , expression mode , thinking mode , cultural differences and so on , is needed to be guided and developed in the daily communication environment most people learn foreign language in the circumstance filled with the using of their native language so that their ability of code switching can not be stimulated , and thus the efficiency of foreign language acquisition would decrease compulsory education , for most people , is the period that they have access to a second or foreign language for the first time one would be able to undergo a lot of specialized learning in order to truly master a great number of rules of vocabulary , grammar and verbal communication learning a foreign language during adulthood means one is pursuing a higher value of themself by obtaining a new skill an increasing number of people are now combining tourisms with language study in the native country though education systems around the world invest enormous sums of money into language teaching the outcomes in terms of getting students to actually speak the language ( s ) they are learning outside the classroom are

to have multiple languages at one 's disposal bilingual education has been implemented in many countries including the united states , in order to promote both the use and appreciation of the minority language , as well as the majority language concerned suitable resources for teaching and learning minority languages can be difficult to find and access , which has led to calls for the increased development of materials for minority language teaching language learning 2.0 ( the use of web 2.0 tools for language education ) offers opportunities for material development for lesser-taught
