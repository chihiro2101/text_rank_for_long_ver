there are institutional broadcast stations in the range that transmit coded time signals to radio clocks they use long-wave , rather than shortwave or mediumwave , because long-wave signals from the transmitter to the receiver always travel along the same direct path across the surface of the earth , so the time delay correction for the signal travel time from the transmitting station to the receiver is always the same for any one receiving location the delay between when the long-wave signal was sent from the transmitter ( when the coded time was correct ) and when the signal is received by the clock ( when the coded time is slightly late ) depends on the overland distance between the clock and the transmitter and the speed of light in a medium , which is also very nearly constant since the time lag is essentially the same , a single constant shift forward from the time coded in the signal can compensate for all long-wave signals received at any one location from the same time signal station may transmit on the newly-allocated 2200-meter band from 136–139 & nbsp ; khz at maximum equivalent power radiated from the antenna of 1 & nbsp ; watt ( eirp ) ; most nations in europe already have adopted the new band , along with many others worldwide nowadays , in the united states , part 15 of fcc regulations allow unlicensed use of the 160–190 & nbsp ; khz band a transmitter / amplifier output power to the antenna of at most 1 & nbsp ; watt , with an antenna at most 15 & nbsp ; meters ( 49 & nbsp ; feet ) high ; this is called lowfer ( lowfer ) frequencies from 472–479 & nbsp ; khz are available to licensed amateurs as the new 630-meter band , part of the now-defunct 500 khz , but this is often considered a medium wave sub-band typically , a larger geographic area can be covered by a long-wave broadcast transmitter compared to a medium-wave one some radio broadcasters , for instance droitwich transmitting station in the uk , derive their carrier frequencies from an atomic clock , allowing their use as frequency standards
