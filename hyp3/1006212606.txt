within 10–20 & nbsp ; million years rift valleys formed on either side of the central bulge , which became flooded to become the proto-atlantic and proto-indian oceans the upliftment of the central plateau over the past 20 & nbsp ; million years and erosion resulted in the original escarpment being moved inland , creating the present-day coastal plain the position of the present escarpment is approximately inland from the original fault lines that formed the walls of the rift valley that developed along the coast during the break-up of gondwana these are the clarens formation laid down under desert conditions about 200 & nbsp ; million years ago , topped by a thick layer of lava which erupted , and covered most of southern africa , and large parts of gondwana , about 180 million years ago these rocks form the steep sides of the great escarpment in this region , where its upper edge reaches an elevation in excess of the erosional retreat of the escarpment from the coast to its present position , means that the rocks of the coastal plain are , with very few and small exceptions , older than those that cap the top of the escarpment in the main , the rocks of the kwazulu-natal midlands belong to the beaufort and ecca groups ( of the karoo supergroup ) , aged 220–310 & nbsp ; million years , and are therefore considerably older than the drakensberg lavas ( aged 180 & nbsp ; million years ) that cap the escarpment on the border between kwazulu-natal and lesotho the lower limpopo river and save river drain into the indian ocean through what remains of this relict incipient rift valley that now forms part of the south african low veld the limpopo , mpumalanga , and lesotho drakensberg have hard erosion-resistant upper surfaces and therefore have a very rugged appearance , combining steep-sided blocks and pinnacles ( giving rise to the zulu name '' barrier of up-pointed spears '' ) the large number of tributaries give the lesotho highlands a very rugged mountainous appearance , both from the ground and from the air knight and grab mapped out the distribution of lightning strikes in the drakensburg and discovered that lightning significantly controls the evolution of the mountain landscapes because it helps to shape the summit areas – the highest areas – with this blasting effect the portion of the drakensberg that forms the kwazulu-natal – free state border is formed by slightly younger beaufort group ( 250 & nbsp ; million years old ) that also are part of the karoo supergroup the drakensberg that form the northeastern and eastern borders of lesotho , as well as the eastern cape drakensberg , are composed of a thick layer of basalt ( lava ) that erupted 180 million years ago north of lesotho the range becomes lower and less rugged until entering mpumalanga where the quartzite mountains of the transvaal drakensberg are loftier and more broken and they form the eastern rim of the transvaal basin , the blyde river canyon lying within this stretch high rainfall generates many mountain streams and rivers , including the sources of the orange river , southern africa 's longest , and the tugela river meanwhile , the lower slopes are mainly grassland , but are also home to conifers , which are rare in africa , the species of conifer found in the drakensberg is podocarpus the grassland is of interest as it contains a great number of endemic plants the lower slopes of the drakensberg support much wildlife , perhaps most importantly the rare southern white rhinoceros ( which was nurtured here when facing extinction ) and the black wildebeest ( connochaetes gnou , which only thrives in protected areas and game reserves ) most of the higher south african parts of the range have been designated as game reserves or wilderness areas the royal natal national park , which contains some of the higher peaks , is part of this large park complex nearly all of the original grassland and forest has disappeared and more protection is needed , although the giant 's castle is a haven for the eland and also is a breeding ground for the bearded vulture
