a major task taken on by dennett in elbow room is to clearly describe just what people are as biology entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance in discussing what people are and why free will matters to them , dennett makes use of an evolutionary perspective dennett points out the fact that as long as people see themselves as able to avoid futility , most people have seen enough of the free will issue it is in this sense of people as animals with complex brains that can model reality and appear to choose among several possible behaviors that dennett says we have free will how do we reconcile our feeling of free will with the idea that we might be mechanics components of a mechanical universe ? what about determinism ? when we say that a person chooses among several possible behaviors is there really a choice or does it just seem like there is a choice ? do people just ( through the action of their more complex brains ) simply have better behaviors than wasps , while still being totally mechanical in executing those behaviors ? dennett gives his definition of determinism on page one : all physical events are caused or determined by the sum total of all previous events this definition dodges a question that many people feel should not be dodged : if we repeatedly replayed the universe from the same point in time would it always reach the same future ? since we have no way of performing this experiment , this question is a long-term classic in philosophy and physicists have tried to interpret the results of other experiments in various ways in order to figure out the answer to this question dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will , a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time the type of free will that dennett thinks we have is finally stated clearly in the last chapter of the book : the power to be active agents , biological devices that respond to our environment with rational , desirable courses of action if our hypothetically mechanical brains are in control of our behavior and our brains produce good behaviors for us , then do we really need such choice ? is an illusion of behavioral choices just as good as actual choices ? is our sensation of having the freedom to execute more than one behavior at a given time really just an illusion ? dennett argues that choice exists in a general sense : that because we base our decisions on context , we limit our options as the situation becomes more specific if people are determined to act as they do , then what about personal responsibility ? how can we hold people responsible and punish them for their behaviors if they have no choice in how they behave ? dennett gives a two-part answer to this question : first , we hold people responsible for their actions because we know from historical experience that this is an effective means to make people behave in a socially acceptable way one final issue : if people do not have real behavioral choices , why not collapse into fatalism ? again , dennett 's argument is that we may not have behavioral choice , but we do have control of our behavior in elbow room , he tries to explain why all the attempts that people have made to prove that people have libertarian choice have failed and are , in the final analysis , not really important anyhow if this connection between our brains ' efforts to model reality and predict the future and so make possible good outcomes is disconnected from our sense of self and our will , then fatalism and self-destructive behaviors are close at hand however , the same effect is attainted if , despite not believing in the control free will gives , we believe that does not prevent us to live as fully as our bodies allow us to and to try harder to achieve things if we think we have agency nor does it explain the reason we experience we are not acting freely in survival-related actions but we experience free will in other sets of non-survival situations
