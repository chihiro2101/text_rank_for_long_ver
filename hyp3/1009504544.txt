there are fourteen tail feathers each with a pointed tip , the outer two slightly shorter than the others giving a rounded tail the primaries are brownish-black with the leading edge fringed grey and the inner edge of the outer feathers grey near the base whereas the inner feathers are fringed with brown near the base the axillaries and under wing-coverts are white and the under tail-coverts have dark greyish-brown bases and margins and white centres and tips the female is very similar to the male but the upper parts are somewhat more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes the beak is similar to the male 's winter beak it takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on when a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction , keeping up a constant chatter when foraging on the ground , often in association with redwings , the group works its way up wind , each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding in the winter , groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country , agricultural land , orchards and open woodland some of these are still on passage and carry on into continental europe but others remain when these are exhausted , or in particularly harsh weather , the birds may move to marshes or even the foreshore where molluscs are to be found the location is often in woodland but may be in a hedgerow , garden , among rocks , in a pile of logs , in a hut or on the ground fieldfares usually nest in close proximity to others of the same species many are pale blue speckled with fine brown dots and resemble those of the common blackbird others are bright blue , with or without larger red-brown splotches they are usually ready to leave the nest after fourteen to sixteen days and there may be two broods in the season , especially in the southern parts of the breeding range the population size appears to be stable and the bird is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criteria of the iucn red list of threatened species ( i.e in the united kingdom , at the extreme edge of the fieldfare 's breeding range , only a handful of pairs breed
