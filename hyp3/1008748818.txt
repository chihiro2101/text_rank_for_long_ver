the first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from '' nanfang caomu zhuang '' ( 南方草木狀 plants of the southern regions ) ( c the first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the united states was that of the braconid cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884 , imported from europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly , pieris rapae pages 3–11 in 1905 the usda initiated its first large-scale biological control program , sending entomologists to europe and japan to look for natural enemies of the gypsy moth , lymantria dispar dispar , and brown-tail moth , brown-tail , invasive pests of trees and shrubs although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies , the frequency , duration , and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful two control agents were introduced to help control the spread of the plant , the cactus moth cactoblastis cactorum , and the scale insect dactylopius importation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest 's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally early instances were often unofficial and not based on research , and some introduced species became serious pests themselves damage from hypera postica , the alfalfa weevil , a serious introduced pest of forage , was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies the agasicles hygrophila and two other biological controls were released in florida , greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant small commercially reared parasitoidal wasps , trichogramma ostriniae , provide limited and erratic control of the european corn borer ( ostrinia nubilalis ) , a serious pest the population of levuana iridescens , the levuana moth , a serious coconut pest in fiji , was brought under control by a classical biological control program in the 1920s augmentation involves the supplemental release of natural enemies that occur in a particular area , boosting the naturally occurring populations there in inoculative release , small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals to allow them to reproduce , in the hope of setting up longer-term control and thus keeping the pest down to a low level , constituting prevention rather than cure in inundative release , in contrast , large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population , correcting a problem that has already arisen the conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control natural enemies are already adapted to the habitat and to the target pest , and their conservation can be simple and cost-effective , as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields predators of aphids were similarly found to be present in tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in england , but they spread too slowly to reach the centers of fields cropping systems can be modified to favor natural enemies , a practice sometimes referred to as habitat manipulation things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects , in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allow insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter in cotton production , the replacement of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as bt cotton can create a more favorable environment for natural enemies of cotton pests due to reduced insecticide exposure risk reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from bt cotton can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases , but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in bt and non-bt cotton are often similar predators are mainly free-living species that directly consume a large number of prey during their whole lifetime given that many major crop pests are insects , many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species the running crab spider philodromus cespitum also prey heavily on aphids , and act as a biological control agent in european fruit orchards upon entering the insect they move to the hemolymph where they recover from their stagnated state of development and release their bacterial symbiosis predators including cactoblastis cactorum ( mentioned above ) can also be used to destroy invasive plant species for rodent pests , cats are effective biological control when used in conjunction with reduction of refuge ( ecology ) locations although there are no quantitative studies of the effectiveness of barn owls for this purpose , they are known rodent predators that can be used in addition to or instead of cats ; they can be encouraged into an area with nest boxes in most instances , production will need to be matched with the appropriate release dates when susceptible host species at a suitable phase of development will be available rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field , and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the point of use can pose problems birds are a natural form of biological control , but the trichogramma minutum , a species of parasitic wasp , has been investigated as an alternative to more controversial chemical controls various microbial insect diseases occur naturally , but may also be used as biological pesticides baculoviridae are specific to individual insect host species and have been shown to be useful in biological pest control therefore , the australian dung beetle project ( 1965–1985 ) , led by george bornemissza of the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation , released forty-nine species of dung beetle , to reduce the amount of dung and therefore also the potential breeding sites of the fly in cases of massive and severe infection of invasive pests , techniques of pest control are often used in combination an introduced control does not always target only the intended pest species ; it can also target native species however , the toad thrived by feeding on other insects and soon spread very rapidly ; it took over native amphibian habitat and brought foreign disease to native toads and frogs , dramatically reducing their populations however , there has been some recent evidence that native predators are adapting , both physiologically and through changing their behaviour , so in the long run , their populations may recover however , the weevil also attacks native thistles , harming such species as the endemic platte thistle ( cirsium neomexicanum ) by selecting larger plants ( which reduced the gene pool ) , reducing seed production and ultimately threatening the species ' survival the sturdy and prolific eastern mosquitofish ( gambusia holbrooki ) is a native of the southeastern united states and was introduced around the world in the 1930s and '40s to feed on mosquito larvae and thus combat malaria however , it has thrived at the expense of local species , causing a decline of endemic fish and frogs through competition for food resources , as well as through eating their eggs and larvae a potential obstacle to the adoption of biological pest control measures is that growers may prefer to stay with the familiar use of pesticides however , pesticides have undesired effects , including the development of resistance among pests , and the destruction of natural enemies ; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted , and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides in the philippines , early-season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice , but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb ' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting ; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use related to biological pest control is the technique of introducing sterile individuals into the native population of some organism
