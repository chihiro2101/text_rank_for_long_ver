though joseph smith , the founder of the latter day saint movement , never used the term '' adam–god '' in any of his recorded public statements , he provided several teachings from which the doctrine 's adherents draw support for example , smith taught in an 1839 sermon that adam was actually the archangel michael , who held the first presidency in the premortal life in the same sermon , smith taught that adam holds '' the keys of the universe , '' ( '' adam delivers up his stewardship to christ , that which was delivered to him as holding the keys of the universe , but retains his standing as head of the human family in 1840 , smith taught that adam is the one '' through whom christ has been revealed from heaven , and will continue to be revealed from henceforth finally , smith taught in his 1844 king follett discourse that god was once a man '' like one of us ( citing minutes of meeting of the quorum of twelve , 4 april 1860 , in which it was recorded : '' it was joseph 's doctrine that adam was god cannon said '' that adam is our father and is a true doctrine revealed from god to joseph & brigham '' ) ; ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 16 december 1867 , stating that '' president young said adam was michael the archangel , & he was the father of jesus christ & was our god & that joseph taught this principle '' ) ; ( citing an 1877 reminiscence of anson call , who said he heard smith say that '' now regarding adam : he came here from another planet as an immortalized being and brought his wife , eve , with him , and by eating of the fruits of the earth became subject to death and decay and he became of the earth , earthly , was made mortal and subject to death ; ( '' young 's adam–god teachings were an expansion of joseph smith 's sermons in 1839-44 '' ) ; ( stating that there is '' no reliable evidence contemporary to smith 's lifetime which lends support '' to the view that smith taught the adam–god doctrine , and that young '' was not above inventing support for beliefs where none existed previously '' ) although young is generally credited with originating the doctrine , the original source may also have been young 's counselor in the first presidency , heber c ( describing the adam–god doctrine as '' that adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world , including jesus christ '' ) smith journal , 6/17/1871 ) ( describing michael as a '' god in the council of gods '' also , the doctrine teaches that michael was the father of the spirits in heaven who are associated with this earth next , the doctrine teaches that michael came to the earth with one of his wives , where they became known as adam and eve , and became the progenitor of the human race and the father of mortal bodies of all his spirit offspring so that they could progress and achieve godhood like themselves the names '' adam '' and '' eve '' are titles that reflect their roles as the parents of humanity , adam meaning man or '' father of mankind '' and eve meaning the '' mothers of all living ( noting that in the late 19th century , several mormon leaders who still adhered to the adam–god doctrine began to adopt the modern mormon belief that the old testament deity was also jesus ) smith taught that a similar gathering is to prelude the second coming of christ the naming of adam-ondi-ahman is also recorded in the history of the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints in volume 2 , chapter 9 , pages 153–154 ; ( describing the adam–god doctrine as '' that adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world , including jesus christ '' ) whether or not smith had taught the doctrine , the first recorded explanation of the doctrine using the term '' adam–god '' was by young , who first taught the doctrine at the church 's spring general conference on april 9 , 1852 . in watt 's transcript of the sermon , young said he intended to discuss '' who it was that begat the son of the virgin mary , '' a subject which he said '' has remained a mystery in this kingdom up to this day the transcript reads : when our father adam came into the garden of eden , he came into it with a celestial body , and brought eve , one of his wives , with him he is michael , the archangel , the ancient of days ! about whom holy men have written and spoken & mdash ; he is our father and our god , and the only god with whom we have to do . the full text from journal of discourses 1:51 reads as follows : '' it is true that the earth was organized by three distinct characters , namely , eloheim , yahovah , and michael , these three forming a quorum , as in all heavenly bodies , and in organizing element , perfectly represented in the deity , as father , son , and holy ghost for example , attendee samuel hollister rogers wrote several days later , confirming that young said that when adam went to the garden , he '' brought his wife or one of his wives with him '' , that '' adam was the only god that we would have , and that christ was not begotten by the holy ghost , but of the father adam wilford woodruff wrote that young said god went to the garden of eden with '' one of his wifes '' , that '' adam is michael or god and all the god that we have any thing to do with '' , and '' when the virgin mary was begotton with child it was by the father and in no other way ownly as we were begotton in the october conference , young is reported as clarifying that adam and eve were '' natural father and mother of every spirit that comes to this planet , or that receives tabernacles on this planet , consequently we are brother and sisters , and that adam was god , our eternal father 87–88 ( '' there are lords many and there are gods many , & the father of our spirits is the father of jesus christ : he is the father of jesus christ , spirit & body and he is the beginner of the bodies of all men '' ) ; john pulsipher papers , mss 1041 , p 35–37 , byu special collections ( '' there are lords many & gods many but the god that we have to account to , is the father of our spirits & mdash ; adam when young discussed the doctrine again in early 1857 , he emphasized again that '' to become acquainted with our father and our god '' was '' one of the first principles of the doctrine of salvation '' , and that '' no man can enjoy or be prepared for eternal life without that knowledge '' nevertheless , he later said : whether adam is the personage that we should consider our heavenly father , or not , is considerable of a mystery to a good many i do not care for one moment how that is ; it is no matter whether we are to consider him our god , or whether his father , or his grandfather , for in either case we are of one species of one family and jesus christ is also of our species for example , the clerk of the conference , thomas bullock , recorded that during young 's sermon , '' the holy ghost rested upon him with great power '' richards , accepted the doctrine '' that adam is our father and our god '' as well , stating in a conference held in june 1854 that '' the prophet and apostle brigham has declared it , and that it is the word of the lord '' kimball readily adopted young 's views , and preached on june 29 , 1856 , that '' i have learned by experience that there is but one god that pertains to this people , and he is the god that pertains to this earth—the first man one published in 1856 , entitled '' we believe in our god '' , stated : '' we believe in our god the great prince of his race , / the archangel michael , the ancient of days , / our own father adam , earth 's lord , as is plain '' the first line of a poem published in 1861 , titled '' sons of michael '' , stated : '' sons of michael , he approaches !

'' daily journal of abraham h however , some prominent members of the church took issue with the doctrine for example , he stated that on the way to exaltation , one would have to '' pass by '' and '' pay tribute to '' various apostles and prophets , then jesus , and '' at length '' he said many would be surprised and humiliated , after passing by jesus , to find '' father adam '' standing there ; however , he said , '' those are ideas which do not concern us at present , although it is written in the bible—'this is eternal life , to know thee the only true god , and jesus christ whom thou hast sent richards who , according to one researcher , interpreted the idea of adam being '' our god '' or '' our father '' as meaning merely that adam , as the first mortal man , stands at the head of the human family richards , who , as editor of the millennial star and president of the church in the british isles , first published president young 's initial sermon on the subject ( millennial star , december 10 , 1853 ) '' ; robinson also argues that franklin d in 1861 , he stated : some years ago , i advanced a doctrine with regard to adam being our father and god , that will be a curse to many of the elders of israel because of their folly had i revealed the doctrine of baptism from sic the dead instead of joseph smith there are men around me who would have ridiculed the idea until dooms day sic ? ( citing minutes of meeting of the quorum of twelve , 4 april 1860 , in which it was recorded : '' it was joseph 's doctrine that adam was god cannon said '' that adam is our father and is a true doctrine revealed from god to joseph & brigham ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 16 december 1867 , stating that '' president young said adam was michael the archangel , & he was the father of jesus christ & was our god & that joseph taught this principle '' ) in 1873 , young again taught the doctrine publicly , and indicated that when adam came to the earth , he left behind many wives other than eve at the place from which adam came ; however , he said he was '' not disposed to give any farther knowledge concerning '' how much unbelief exists in the minds of the latter-day saints in regard to one particular doctrine which is revealed to them , and which god revealed to me—namely that adam is our father and god john nuttall , young 's secretary , recorded in his journal a transcription of young 's temple lecture regarding the adam-god doctrine : a portion of that journal entry reads as follows : adam was an immortal being when he came during the course of the meeting , young gave some teachings which nuttall later recorded in his personal journal there is some controversy as to whether or not young considered adam–god to be official church doctrine after young 's death , church leaders began to cast the various interpretations of this teaching as mere speculation and denied that any particular interpretation was binding on the church smith , then an apostle and counselor in the first presidency , wrote a private letter concerning young 's teachings on adam , stating : the doctrine was never submitted to the councils of the priesthood nor to the church for approval or ratification , and was never formally or otherwise accepted by the church '' adam is our father and god and no use to discuss it with the josephites reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints or any one else after the start of the 20th century , church leaders openly took the position that the doctrine should no longer to be taught publicly penrose claimed , '' the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints has never formulated or adopted any theory concerning the subject treated upon by president young as to adam mcconkie gave a speech elaborating upon the church 's position towards the adam–god theory : there are those who believe or say they believe that adam is our father and our god , that he is the father of our spirits and our bodies , and that he is the one we worship it is contrary to the whole plan of salvation set forth in the scriptures , and anyone who has read the book of moses , and anyone who has received the temple endowment and who yet believes the adam–god theory does not deserve to be saved in the book , musser contended that the rejection of the doctrine by the lds church can be linked to its rejection of plural marriage , which occurred around the same time : and let us here remind the reader that as long as belief in the patriarchal order of marriage and other advanced principles of the gospel was maintained , the minds of the saints were open and receptive
