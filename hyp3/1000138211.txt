one of the artists , paul sérusier , had traveled to pont-aven in october 1888 , where under the guidance of paul gauguin he made a small painting of the port on wood , composed of patches of vivid color assembled to give the feeling of the port the students called this first nabis painting the talisman , and it eventually became an icon of 20th-century art writing under the name pierre louis , he wrote an article in the journal art et critique entitled the definition of neo-traditionalism , which became the manifesto of the movement '' this idea was not original to denis ; the idea had been forward not long before by hippolyte taine in the philosophy of art , where taine wrote : '' a painting is a colored surface , in which the various tones and various degrees of light are placed with a certain choice ; that is its intimate being as denis explained , he did not mean that form of the painting was more important than the subject it was frequented by other early nabis , including ker-xavier roussel and paul sérusier , as well as journalists and figures from the theatrical and literary world maurice denis made costumes and sets for another theatrical production , the trilogy d'antoina at the théatre moderne , and also painted a ceiling for the residence of the art collector and painter henry lerolle the nabis held a group exhibition in toulouse in june 1894 , and the following year presented their work in siegfried bing 's maison de l'art nouveau , the famous gallery which had given its name to the art nouveau movement the style was popularized in france by the art dealer siegfried bing , who traveled to japan to collect prints by hokusai and other japanese artists , and published a monthly art journal , le japon artistique , between may 1888 and april 1891 , which offered color illustrations 38-40 pierre bonnard was particularly influenced by the japanese style ; his nickname among the nabis was '' le plus japonard '' for one series of four paintings created in 1890–91 , the women in the garden , now in the musée d'orsay , bonnard adapted a japanese format called kamemono with a narrow vertical canvas the theme of women in a garden , stylistically adapted from japanese prints , appeared in the work of other nabis , including maurice denis and paul sérusier their approach to their order was partly humorous and whimsical ; the studio of ranson at 25 boulevard du montparnasse was called their '' temple '' , madame ranson was termed '' the light of the temple '' , and the original nabi painting by sérusier was displayed in the studio like a shrine , and titled the talisman in 1895 , he received a commission for a series of seven large paintings called the legend of saint hubert for the paris home of baron cochin paul sérusier painted less christian and more mystical scenes , particularly la vision pros du torrent or the rendezvous of fairies ( 1897 ) , showing a group of women in breton costumes passing through the forest , carrying bouquets of flowers to a ceremony , and femmes à la source , depicting a series of women solemnly descending through a mystical forest to a spring in some of the paintings , such as vuillard 's the seamstress and la table de toilet ( 1895 ) , or people in an interior - music , it is difficult to even find and count the individuals in the painting 52-55 les nabis et le décor - musée du luxembourg , paris file : seamstress by edouard vuillard.jpg édouard vuillard , the seamstress , ( 1893 ) , indianapolis museum of art file : edouard vuillard - woman in a striped dress - google art project.jpg édouard vuillard , woman in a striped dress ( 1895 ) , national gallery of art file : vuilllard interior 1896.jpg édouard vuillard , people in interior- music ( 1896 ) , petit palais museum , paris file : misia at the piano met dt3150.jpg misia at the piano ( c it appeared in four panels representing the seasons of a young woman 's life by maurice denis ( 1890–91 ) , painted for the bedroom of a young girl , and in the panels of women in the public parks of paris by édouard vuillard ( 1894 ) painted for the residence of his patron alexandre nathanson ;
