the aim of this expedition was to weaken the power of the timor kings and even as this expedition was made by the topasses , the 'black portuguese ' , it succeeded to extend the portuguese influence into the interior of the country the island was seen as a way to exile those who the government in lisbon saw as '' problems '' - these included political prisoners as well as ordinary criminals this australian military intervention dragged portuguese timor into the pacific war but it also slowed the japanese expansion when the japanese did occupy timor , in february 1942 , a 400-strong dutch-australian force and large numbers of timorese volunteers engaged them in battle of timor ( 1942–43 ) after the allied evacuation in february 1943 the east timorese continued fighting the japanese , with comparatively little collaboration with the enemy taking place this was partly as indonesia was preoccupied with gaining control of west irian , now called papua , which had been retained by the netherlands after indonesian independence in fact , at the united nations , indonesian diplomats stressed that their country did not seek control over any territory outside the former netherlands east indies , explicitly mentioning portuguese timor one of the first acts of the new government in lisbon was to appoint a new governor for the colony on 18 november 1974 , in the form of mário lemos pires , who would ultimately be , as events were to prove , the last governor of portuguese timor one of its leaders , mário viegas carrascalão , one of the few timorese to have been educated at university in portugal , later became indonesian governor of east timor during the 1980s and early 1990s , although with the demise of indonesian rule , he would change to supporting independence apodeti drew support from a few liurai in the border region , some of whom had collaborated with the japanese during the second world war suharto 's '' new order '' , which had effectively eliminated indonesia 's communist party pki in 1965 , was alarmed by what it saw as the increasingly left-leaning fretilin , and by the prospect of a small independent leftist state in the midst of the archipelago inspiring separatism in parts of the surrounding archipelago at a meeting in the javanese town of wonosobo in 1974 , he told suharto that an independent portuguese timor would be 'an unviable state , and a potential threat to the stability of the region' many indonesian military figures held meetings with udt leaders , who made it plain that jakarta would not tolerate a fretilin-led administration in an independent east timor many local leaders saw independence as unrealistic , and were open to discussions with jakarta over portuguese timor 's incorporation into the indonesian state indonesia sought to portray the conflict as a civil war , which had plunged portuguese timor into chaos , but after only a month , aid and relief agencies from australia and elsewhere visited the territory , and reported that the situation was stable while fretilin had sought the return of the portuguese governor , pointedly flying the portuguese flag from government offices , the deteriorating situation meant that it had to make an appeal to the world for international support , independently of portugal an international east timor solidarity movement arose in response to the 1975 invasion of east timor by indonesia and the occupation that followed the movement was most extensive in neighbouring australia , in portugal , in the philippines and the former portuguese colonies in africa , but had significant force in the united states , canada and europe unlike the portuguese , the indonesians favoured strong , direct rule , which was never accepted by the timorese people who were determined to preserve their culture and national identity attempts by the united nations secretary general 's special representative , vittorio winspeare-guicciardi to visit fretilin-held areas from darwin , australia , were obstructed by the indonesian military , which blockaded east timor on 31 may 1976 , a 'people 's assembly ' in dili , selected by indonesian intelligence , unanimously endorsed an 'act of integration ' , and on 17 july , east timor officially became the 27th province of the republic of indonesia ( timor timur ) the occupation of east timor remained a public issue in many nations , portugal in particular , and the un never recognised either the regime installed by the indonesians or the subsequent annexation we can refer to the resolution approved by the united nations general assembly on 12 december 1975 , saying '' having heard the statements of the representatives of portugal , as the administering power , concerning developments in portuguese timor.deplores the military intervention of the armed forces of indonesia in portuguese timor and calls upon the government of indonesia to withdraw without delay its armed forces from the territory.and recommends that the security council take urgent action to protect the territorial integrity of portuguese timor and the inalienable right of its people to self-determination '' indeed , they supported it by selling arms or making offerings of aid ( it is believed that the united states provided 90 % of indonesia 's arms ) , by making some military training programs in indonesia , by not covering the events taking place in timor , or by saying that the deaths were due to former conflicts by 1989 , indonesia had things firmly under control and opened east timor to tourism while indonesia introduced a civilian administration , the military remained in control timorese groups fought a campaign of resistance against indonesian forces for the independence of east timor , during which many atrocities and human rights violations by the indonesian army were reported foreign powers such as the australian government , concerned to maintain good relations with indonesia , had been consistently reluctant to assist a push for independence ( despite popular sympathy for the east timorese cause among many in the australian electorate ) however , arms sales continued from the us to the indonesian national armed forces the australian government promoted a strong connection with the indonesian military at the time of the massacre , but also cut off ties in 1999 right the massacre had a profound effect on public opinion in portugal , especially after television footage showing east timorese praying in portuguese , and independence leader xanana gusmão gained widespread respect , being awarded the portugal 's highest honour in 1993 , after he had been captured and imprisoned by the indonesians in australia , there was also widespread public outrage , and criticism of canberra 's close relationship with the suharto regime and recognition of jakarta 's sovereignty over east timor prime minister keating 's first overseas trip was to indonesia in april 1992 and sought to improve trade and cultural relations , but repression of the east timorese continued to mar co-operation between the two nations nevertheless , australia provided important sanctuary to east timorese independence advocates like josé ramos-horta ( who based himself in australia during his exile ) while just 20 % of east timorese called themselves catholics in 1975 , the figure surged to reach 95 % by the end of the first decade after the invasion pope john paul ii 's 1989 visit to east timor exposed the occupied territory 's situation to world media and provided a catalyst for independence activists to seek global support he urged the freeing of all east timorese leaders in a note reading , '' we can never normalize the situation in east timor unless all political leaders , including mr in 1998 , following the resignation of suharto and his replacement by president habibie , jakarta moved towards offering east timor autonomy within the indonesian state , although ruled out independence , and stated that portugal and the un must recognise indonesian sovereignty portugal had started to gain some political allies firstly in the eu , and after that in other places of the world to pressure indonesia the letter supported the idea of autonomy but went much further by suggesting that the east timores be given a chance to vote on independence within a decade the letter upset habibie , who saw it as implying indonesia was a '' colonial power '' and he decided in response to announce a snap referendum to be conducted within six months the referendum , held on 30 august , gave a clear majority ( 78.5 % ) in favour of independence , rejecting the alternative offer of being an autonomous province within indonesia , to be known as the special autonomous region of east timor ( saret ) the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs , labor 's laurie brereton , was vocal in highlighting evidence of the indonesian military 's involvement in pro-integrationist violence and advocated united nations peacekeeping to support the east timor 's ballot the catholic church in australia urged the australian government to send an armed peacekeeping force to east timor to end the violence president bill clinton for an australian led international peace keeper force to enter east timor to end the violence finally , on 11 september , bill clinton announced : indonesia , in dire economic straits relented and on 12 september , indonesian president habibie announced : it was clear that the un did not have sufficient resources to combat the paramilitary forces directly east timor became formally independent on 20 may 2002 in 2005 , the commission for reception , truth and reconciliation in east timor reported on human rights violations in period of indonesian rule and the year before and offered the first national history of east timor driven by timorese oral histories while unclear , the motives behind the fighting appeared to be the distribution of oil funds and the poor organisation of the timorese army and police , which included former indonesian-trained police and former timorese rebels as of 25 may 2006 , australia , portugal , new zealand , and malaysia sent troops to timor , attempting to quell the violence the australian government immediately sent reinforcements to east timor to keep order new zealand announced in early november 2012 , it would be pulling its troops out of the country , saying the country was now stable and calm five new zealand troops were killed in the 13 years the
