he subsequently began drawing lines across his ordnance survey maps , developing the view that ancient british people had tended to travel in straight lines , using '' mark points '' along the landscape to guide them he put forward his idea of ley lines in the 1922 book early british trackways and then again , in greater depth , in the 1925 book the old straight track watkins had drawn upon earlier research ; he cited the work of the english astronomer norman lockyer , who had argued that ancient alignments might be oriented to sunrise and sunset at solstices the term ley derived from the old english term for a cleared space , with watkins adopting it for his lines because he found it to be part of the place-names of various settlements that were along the lines he traced some of watkins ' other ideas , such as his belief that widespread forest clearance took place in prehistory rather than later , would nevertheless later be recognised by archaeologists it was in the latter decade of this period that a belief in ley lines was taken up by members of the counterculture , where—in the words of the archaeologist matthew johnson—they were attributed with '' sacred significance or mystical power '' ruggles noted that in this period , ley lines came to be conceived as '' lines of power , the paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient ancestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought '' michell 's publication was followed by an upsurge in ley hunting as enthusiasts travelled around the british landscape seeking to identify what they believed to be ley lines connecting various historic structures it was later edited by paul screeton , who also wrote the book quicksilver heritage , in which he argued that the neolithic period had seen an idyllic society devoted to spirituality but that this was brought to an end through the introduction of metal technologies in the bronze age part of the popularity of ley hunting was that individuals without any form of professional training in archaeology could take part and feel that they could rediscover '' the magical landscapes of the past '' ley hunters often differed on how they understood the ley lines ; some believed that leys only marked a pre-existing energy current , whereas others thought that the leys helped to control and direct this energy ley hunters nevertheless often took an interest in the work of archaeoastronomy like alexander thom and euan mackie , being attracted to their arguments about the existence of sophisticated astronomer-priests in british prehistory in suggesting that prehistoric britons were far more advanced in mathematics and astronomy than archaeologists had previously accepted , thom 's work was seen as giving additional credibility to the beliefs of ley hunters thom lent the idea of leys some support ; in 1971 he stated the view that neolithic british engineers would have been capable of surveying a straight line between two points that were otherwise not visible from each other he was more concerned than many other ley hunters with finding objective evidence for the idea that unusual forms of energy could be measured at places where prehistoric communities had erected structures professional archaeologists , whose view of the ley hunters was largely negative , took little interest in such research they also demonstrated that ley hunters had often claimed that certain markers were neolithic , and thus roughly contemporary with each other , when often they were of widely different dates , such as being iron age or medieval in particular , it drew attention to ethnographically recorded beliefs in the importance of lines running through the landscape in various communities around the world , proposing these as ethnographic comparisons for what might have occurred in prehistoric britain a prominent example of this was the work of christopher tilley , who devised the idea of phenomenology , or using human senses to experience a landscape as a means of trying to ascertain how past societies would have done the same he also noted that the ley hunting community had '' functioned as an indispensable training ground for a small but important group of non-academic scholars who have made a genuine contribution to the study of folklore and mythology as hutton observed , a belief in '' ancient earth energies have passed so far into the religious experience of the 'new age ' counter-culture of europe and america that it is unlikely that any tests of evidence would bring about an end to belief in them research that took place in 2014 for instance found that various druids and other pagans believed that there were ley lines focusing on the early neolithic site of coldrum long barrow in kent , southeast england one criticism of watkins ' ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in britain and other parts of europe , finding straight lines that '' connect '' sites is trivial and ascribable to coincidence '' he cited williamson and bellamy 's work in demonstrating this , noting that their research showed how '' the density of archaeological sites in the british landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will 'clip ' a number of sites this , he argued , showed that the mere existence of such lines in a set of points does not prove that the lines are deliberate artefacts , especially since it is known that telephone boxes were not laid out in any such manner or with any such intention in 2004 , john bruno hare wrote : watkins never attributed any supernatural significance to leys ; he believed that they were simply pathways that had been used for trade or ceremonial purposes , very ancient in origin , possibly dating back to the neolithic , certainly pre-roman article by alex whitaker an excerpt from the new ley hunter 's guide by paul devereux moonraking : what does it all mean ? finding places of power : dowsing earth energies the ley hunter magazine 1969–1976 ;
