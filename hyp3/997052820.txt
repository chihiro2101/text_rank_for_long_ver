the results suggested that the authors should place all living cone snails in a single family , conidae , containing the following genera : californiconus j the subfamilies included many subfamilies that had previously been classified in the family turridae , and the conus species were moved to the subfamily coninae in further taxonomic changes that took place in 2009 and 2011 , based upon molecular phylogeny ( see below ) , the subfamilies that were previously in the family turridae were elevated to the status of families in their own right tenorio proposed a classification system for the cone shells and their allies ( which resorb their inner walls during growth ) was based upon a cladistical analysis of anatomical characters including the radula , the morphology ( i.e , shell characters ) , as well as an analysis of prior molecular phylogeny studies , all of which were used to construct phylogenetic trees ( 2009 ) systematic classification of recent and fossil conoidean gastropods 133 in their phylogeny , tucker and tenorio noted the close relationship of the cone species within the various clades , corresponding to their proposed families and genera ; this also corresponded to the results of prior molecular studies by puillandre et al zardoya ( 2005 ) , patterns of cladogenesis in the venomous marine gastropod genus conus from the cape verde islands systematic biology 54 ( 4 ) :634-650 this 2009 proposed classification system also outlined the taxonomy for the other clades of conoidea ( that do not resorb their inner walls ) , also based upon morphological , anatomical , and molecular studies , and removes the turridae ( which are a distinct large and diverse group ) from the cone snails , and creates a number of new families tucker and tenorio â€™ s proposed classification system for the cone shells and their allies ( and the other clades of conoidea ) is shown in tucker & tenorio cone snail taxonomy 2009 ( 2011 ) the genus benthofascis ( gastropoda : conoidea ) : a revision with descriptions of new species this is a list of what were recognized extant genera within conidae as per j.k , from 1993 to 2011 , the family conidae was defined as including not only the cone snails , but also a large number of other genera which are commonly known as turridae however , as a result of molecular phylogeny studies in 2011 , many of those genera were moved back to the turridae , or were placed in new '' turrid '' families within the superfamily conoidea there are approximately 30 records of humans killed by cone snails normally , cone snails ( and many species in the superfamily conoidea ) use their venom to immobilize prey before engulfing it the venom is typically made up of 10 to 30 amino acids , but in some species as many as 60 the venom of each cone snail species may contain as many as 200 pharmacologically active components it is estimated that more than 50,000 conopeptides can be found , because every species of cone snail is thought to produce its own specific venom w-conopeptide , from the species conus magus is the basis of the analgesic drug prialt , an approved treatment for pain said to be 1000 times as powerful as morphine and used as a last resort in specific application conoserver , a database of cone snail toxins , known as conopeptides ( 2009 ) , systematic classification of recent and fossil conoidean gastropods , conchbooks , hankenheim , germany , 295 pp
