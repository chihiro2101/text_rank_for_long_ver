the gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament 's role in controlling government , and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government by the 19th century , the great reform act of 1832 led to parliamentary dominance , with its choice invariably deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the westminster model of government , with an executive answerable to parliament , and exercising , in the name of the head of state , powers nominally vested in the head of state some parliaments in this model are elected using a plurality voting system ( first past the post ) , such as the united kingdom , canada , and india , while others use some form of proportional representation , such as ireland and new zealand in countries using this system , members of parliament have to resign their place in parliament upon being appointed ( or elected ) minister implementations of the parliamentary system can also differ as to how the prime minister and government are appointed and whether the government needs the explicit approval of the parliament , rather than just the absence of its disapproval some countries such as india also require the prime minister to be a member of the legislature , though in other countries this only exists as a convention no parliamentary vote takes place on who is forming a government , but since parliament can immediately defeat the government with a motion of no confidence , the head of state is limited by convention to choosing a candidate who can command the confidence of parliament , and thus has little or no influence in the decision the head of state appoints a prime minister who must gain a vote of confidence within a set time for example , in greece , if no party has a majority , the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an exploratory mandate to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days example : under the swedish instrument of government ( 1974 ) , the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the speaker of parliament and the parliament itself example : israel , 1996â€“2001 , where the prime minister was elected in a general election , with no regard to political affiliation , and whose procedure can also be described as of a semi-parliamentary system furthermore , there are variations as to what conditions exist ( if any ) for the government to have the right to dissolve the parliament : in some countries , such as denmark , malaysia , australia and new zealand , the prime minister has the de facto power to call an election , at will since 2011 in the united kingdom , the house of commons may be dissolved early only by a vote of two-thirds of its members , or if a vote of non-confidence passes and no alternative government is formed in the next fourteen days there also exists the semi-presidential system that draws on both presidential systems and parliamentary systems by combining a powerful president with an executive responsible to parliament : for example , the french fifth republic parliamentary systems like that found in the united kingdom are widely considered to be more flexible , allowing rapid change in legislation and policy as long as there is a stable majority or coalition in parliament , allowing the government to have 'few legal limits on what it can do ' due to the first-past-the-post 'this system produces the classic '' westminster model '' with the twin virtues of strong but responsive party government' in the 1989 lebanese taif agreement , in order to give muslims greater political power , lebanon moved from a semi-presidential system with a powerful president to a system more structurally similar to classical parliamentary government in his 1867 book the english constitution , walter bagehot praised parliamentary governments for producing serious debates , for allowing for a change in power without an election , and for allowing elections at any time under a parliamentary system , a prime minister that has lost support in the middle of his term can be easily replaced by his own peers although bagehot praised parliamentary governments for allowing an election to take place at any time , the lack of a definite election calendar can be abused previously under some systems , such as the british , a ruling party could schedule elections when it felt that it was likely to retain power , and so avoid elections at times of unpopularity this problem can be alleviated somewhat by setting fixed dates for parliamentary elections , as is the case in several of australia 's state parliaments in other systems , such as the dutch and the belgian , the ruling party or coalition has some flexibility in determining the election date
