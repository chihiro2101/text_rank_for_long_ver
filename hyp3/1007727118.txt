public policy can be conceptualized in varying ways , according to the purposes of the speaker or author , and the characteristics of the situation they are concerned with one dividing-line in conceptions of public policy is between those that see it primarily in terms of ideas ( principles and plans of action ) and those that see as a collection of empirical phenomena ( the things that are done , and their outcomes ) dye himself admitted that his concept '' discourages elaborate academic discussions of the definition of public policy - we say simply that public policy is whatever governments choose to do or not to do '' public policy is considered strong when it solves problems efficiently and effectively , serves and supports governmental institutions and policies , and encourages active citizenship guy peters defines public policy as '' the set of activities that governments engage in for the purpose of changing their economy and society '' , effectively saying that public policy is legislation brought in with the aim of benefiting or impacting the electorate in some way '' public policy focuses on the decisions that create the outputs of a political system , such as transport policies , the management of a public health service , the administration of a system schooling and the organization of a defense force in the united states , this concept refers not only to the result of policies , but more broadly to the decision-making and analysis of governmental decisions . public policy making and the implementation of public policy public policy making can be characterized as a dynamic , complex , and interactive system through which public problems are identified and resolved through the creation of new policy or reform of existing policy the public problems that influence public policy making can be of economic , social , or political nature public policy making is a time-consuming 'policy cycle ' the policy cycle as set out in understanding public policy , theories and issues agenda setting identifies problems that require government attention , deciding which issue deserve the most attention and defining the nature of the problem this reinforces the policy window , another concept demonstrating the critical moment within a time and situation that a new policy could be motivated the problem stream represents a policy process to compromise for how worthy problems are to create policies and solutions therefore , john kingdon 's model suggests the policy window appears through the emergence and connection of problems , politics and policies , emphasizing the rare opportunity to simulate and initiate new policies its key stages include : pre-problem stage : nature is not recognized by the public , media or policy makers this is the setting of the objectives for the policy , along with identifying the cost and effect of solutions that could be proposed from policy instruments each system is influenced by different public problems and issues , and has different stakeholders ; as such , each requires different public policy many actors can be important in the public policy process , but government officials ultimately choose public policy in response to the public issue or problem at hand the changes pose new challenges to the current public policy systems and pressures leaders to evolve to remain effective and efficient uncertainties policy designers face include ( in brief ) : technical difficulties : mechanism , design , constituency , environment of public policies cost issues : resources , materials , products , etc nevertheless , policy design is elemental for the succession of public policy , with it comes intricate and multi-level approaches but it is necessary for good , careful policy design to be considered before implementing the policy data-driven policy making aims to make use of data and collaborate with citizens to co-create policy policy makers can now make use of new data sources and technological developments like artificial intelligence to gain new insights and make policy decisions which contribute to societal development evidence-based policy is associated with afm smith because in his 1996 presidential address to the royal statistical society , smith questioned the current process of policy making and urged for a more “ evidence-based approach ” commenting that it has “ valuable lessons to offer ” still , the language of evidence-based policy is widely used and , as such , can be interpreted to reflect a desire for evidence to be used well or appropriately in one way or another – such as by ensuring systematic consideration of rigorous and high quality policy relevant evidence , or by avoiding biased and erroneous applications of evidence for political ends furthermore , each level of government is set up in a similar way with similar rules , and all pump money into creating what is hoped to be effective legislation
