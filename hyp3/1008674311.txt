in physics , a world line of an object ( approximated as a point in space , e.g a world line is a special type of curve in spacetime each point of a world line is an event that can be labeled with the time and the spatial position of the object at that time spacetime is the collection of points called events , together with a continuous and smooth coordinate system identifying the events each event can be labeled by four numbers : a time coordinate and three space coordinates ; thus spacetime is a four-dimensional space the concept may be applied as well to a higher-dimensional space the length of m is called the proper time of the worldline or particle a world sheet is the analogous two-dimensional surface traced out by a one-dimensional line ( like a string ) traveling through spacetime once the object is not approximated as a mere point but has extended volume , it traces out not a world line but rather a world tube the use of world lines in general relativity is basically the same as in special relativity , with the difference that spacetime can be curved any timelike curve admits a proper frame whose '' time axis '' corresponds to that curve , and , since no observer is privileged , we can always find a local coordinate system in which lightcones are inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis however , although not widely appreciated , it has been known since feynman that many quantum field theories may equivalently be described in terms of world lines such time machines are often portrayed as being instantaneous , with its contents departing one time and arriving in anotherâ€”but at the same literal geographic point in space world lines and other physical concepts like the dirac sea are also used throughout the series in depth text on world lines and special relativity
