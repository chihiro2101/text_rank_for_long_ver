in the early development of geology , efforts were made in a predominantly christian western society to reconcile biblical narratives of creation and the universal flood with new concepts about the processes which had formed the earth the discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was '' stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the greeks '' , an example being plutarch 's account of the ogygian flood cuvier also believed that the stratigraphic record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions , which he viewed as recurring natural events , amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth buckland spent much of his early career trying to demonstrate the reality of the biblical flood using geological evidence uniformitarian explanations for the formation of sedimentary rock and an understanding of the immense stretch of geological time , or as the concept came to be known deep time , were found in the writing of james hutton , sometimes known as the father of geology , in the late 18th century the geologist charles lyell built upon hutton 's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the earth 's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time from around 1850 to 1980 , most geologists endorsed uniformitarianism ( '' the present is the key to the past '' ) and gradualism ( geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time ) and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as earthquakes , volcano , or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time , played any significant role in the formation of the earth 's surface in part , the geologists ' rejection was fostered by their impression that the catastrophists of the early nineteenth century believed that god was directly involved in determining the history of earth some of the theories about catastrophism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were connected with religion and catastrophic origins were sometimes considered miracle rather than natural events the rise in uniformitarianism made the introduction of a new catastrophe theory very difficult over the past 25 years , a scientifically based catastrophism has gained wide acceptance with regard to certain events in the distant past today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints , taking the view that earth 's history is a slow , gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected earth and its inhabitants
