in most modern western legal systems , judges often instruct juries to act only as '' finder of fact '' , whose role it is to determine the veracity of the evidence presented , the weight accorded to the evidence , to apply that evidence to the law as explained by the judge , and to reach a verdict ; but not to question the law itself others view it as a violation of the right to a jury trial , which undermines the law in the united states , some view the requirement that jurors take an oath to be unlawful in itself , while still others view the oath 's reference to '' deliverance '' to require nullification of unjust law : '' will well and truly try and a true deliverance make between the united states and the defendant at the bar , and a true verdict render according to the evidence , so help me god '' they point to the danger that a jury may choose to convict a defendant who has not broken the letter of the law jury nullification may also occur in civil suits , in which the verdict is generally a finding of liability or lack of liability ( rather than a finding of guilty or not guilty ) the argument has been raised that prosecutors are not allowed to seek jury nullification , and therefore defendants should not be allowed to seek it either today , there are several issues raised by jury nullification , such as : whether juries can or should be instructed or informed of their power to nullify whether all legal arguments , except perhaps on motions to exclude evidence , should be made in the presence of the jury in some cases in the united states , a stealth juror will attempt to get on a jury in order to nullify the law in addition , the writ of attaint allowed a judge to retry the case in front of a second jury when the judge believed the first jury returned a '' false verdict '' the judge attempted to find the jury in contempt of court ;
