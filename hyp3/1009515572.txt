right-handedness is by far the most common type studies suggest that approximately 90 % of people are right-handed left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand the edinburgh handedness inventory has been used since 1971 but contains many dated questions and is hard to score one common handedness theory is the brain hemisphere division of labor the theory suggests it is more efficient for the brain to divide major tasks between the hemispheres—thus most people may use the non-speaking ( right ) hemisphere for work requiring fine motor skills , facilitating the use of speech while working , and resulting in right-handedness the theory implies that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor verbal processing in right-handed people occurs mostly in the left hemisphere , whereas visuospatial processing is done mostly in the right an average taken across all types of left-handedness shows that left-handers are less lateralized performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in handedness diethylstilbestrol animal studies '' suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain , including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance '' previc , after reviewing a large number of studies , found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby 's subsequent birth position can affect handedness infants have been observed to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks , especially in one- versus two-handed grasping children of 18–36 months showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than with simple grasping he says that left-handers ' brains are structured in a way that increases their range of abilities , and that the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the brain 's language centers and australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one iq point , which is not noteworthy he also found that left-handers were overrepresented among those with lower cognitive skills and mental impairments , with those with intellectual disability ( id ) being roughly twice as likely to be left-handed , as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children what they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy ( such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in , or grasping random objects with the left hand ) , they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler in two studies , diana deutsch found that left-handers , particularly those with mixed hand preference , performed significantly better than right-handers in musical memory tasks left-handed people are much more likely to have several specific physical and mental disorders and health problems another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women , but the effect is unknown for men at this point as handedness is a highly heritable trait associated with various medical conditions , and because many of these conditions could have presented a darwinian fitness challenge in ancestral populations , this indicates left-handedness may have previously been rarer than it currently is , due to natural selection however , on average , left-handers have been found to have an advantage in fighting and competitive , interactive sports , which could have increased their reproductive success in ancestral populations other , sports-specific factors may confounding the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations : in cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler 's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone : even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e a disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions , 62 percent , shoot left , though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness a 2001 study also found that male children who have different gender identity were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group ( 19.5 % vs a study at durham university — which examined mortality data for cricketers whose handedness was a matter of public record — found that left-handed men were almost twice as likely to die in war as their right-handed contemporaries he was forced to write with his right hand , as was common practice at the time this would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy in many european languages , including english , the word for the direction '' right '' also means '' correct '' or '' proper '' throughout history , being left-handed was considered negative , or evil ; even into the 20th century , left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand as these are all very old words , they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people , it is considered more difficult to write legible chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write latin letters , though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer because writing when moving one 's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing , writing in the latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand , since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one 's own may not be straightforward red-necked ( bennett 's ) wallabies ( macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation , but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength
