the surly , psychopathic christmas has been on the run for years , ever since at least injuring , perhaps even killing his strict presbyterian adopted father christmas comes to jefferson three years prior to the central events of the novel and gets a job at the mill where byron , and later joe brown , works brown is christmas ' business partner in bootlegging and is leaving joanna 's burning house when a passing farmer stops to investigate and pull joanna 's body from the fire before christmas ' escape attempt , hightower delivers lena 's child in the cabin where brown and christmas had been staying before the murder , and byron arranges for brown/burch to come and see her at the end of the story , an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to tennessee , recounting that the woman had a child and the man was not the father joe christmas & ndash ; a man who came to jefferson three years prior to the events in the novel although he has light skin and is an orphan with no knowledge of his family background , he believes that one of his parents is of african-american ancestry , and this secret has caused him to be a habitual wanderer she is unmarried , lives alone in a manor house outside of jefferson , and is secretly engaged in a sexual relationship with joe christmas she has never seen christmas after the night of his birth and travels to jefferson to ensure that her husband does not successfully have him lynched , because she wants to see him again once more before he is tried for murder the plot is also divided into dual currents , one focusing on lena grove and the other on joe christmas , a technique that faulkner continued to use in other works in august in mississippi there ’ s a few days somewhere about the middle of the month when suddenly there ’ s a foretaste of fall , it ’ s cool , there ’ s a lambence , a soft , a luminous quality to the light , as though it came not from just today but from back in the old classic times '' within the novel itself , the title is alluded to when gail hightower sits at his study window waiting for his recurring vision of his grandfather 's last raid '' the story that would eventually become the novel , started by faulkner in 1931 , was originally titled '' dark house '' and began with hightower sitting at a dark window in his home joanna burden and reverend hightower are hounded by the people of jefferson for years , in a failed effort to make them leave town byron bunch , though more accepted in jefferson , is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked both joe christmas and lena grove are orphans , strangers in town , and social outcasts , though the former draws anger and violence from the community , while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels faulkner is considered one of the foremost american writers on race in the united states , and his novels , including light in august , often explore the persistent obsession with blood and race in the south that have carried over from the antebellum era to the 21st century christmas has light skin but is viewed as a foreigner by the people he meets , and the children in the orphanage in which he was raised called him '' nigger '' chapter 6 begins with the oft-cited sentence : '' memory believes before knowing remembers , '' and gives an account of the five year old christmas amongst the uniform denim of the other children the first reference to him though is not by these children but by the dietitian who gave him a dollar to not tell about her amorous adventure with an intern doctor however suspicion must fall on doc hines joe 's deranged grandfather who placed him in the orphanage and stays on as the boilerman it is he who may have whispered the lie about the little boy 's origins to the other children because of this , joe christmas is fixated on the idea that he has some african american blood , which faulkner never confirms , and views his parentage as an original sin that has tainted his body and actions since birth because of his obsessive struggle with his twin identities , black and white , christmas lives his life always on the road the secret of his blackness is one that he abhors as well as cherishes ; he often willingly tells white people that he is black in order to see their extreme reactions and becomes violent when one white northern woman reacts nonchalantly the characters in light in august & mdash ; who are mostly from the lower classes , with the exception of reverend hightower and joanna burden & mdash ; are united by poverty and puritanical values that cause them to regard an unwed mother like lena grove with disdain according to michael millgate , though it is not typically considered faulkner 's best novel , light in august was recognized early on as being '' a major text , central to any understanding or evaluation of his career as a whole
