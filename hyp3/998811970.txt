according to krashen , the acquisition of a language is a natural process ; whereas learning a language is a conscious one not all educators in second language agree to this distinction ; however , the study of how a second language is learned/acquired is referred to as second-language acquisition ( sla ) focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language and a knowledge of second-language acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults other dominant theories and points of research include 2nd language acquisition studies ( which examine if l1 findings can be transferred to l2 learning ) , verbal behaviour ( the view that constructed linguistic stimuli can create a desired speech response ) , morpheme studies , behaviourism , error analysis , stages and order of acquisition , structuralism ( approach that looks at how the basic units of language relate to each other according to their common characteristics ) , 1st language acquisition studies , contrastive analysis ( approach where languages were examined in terms of differences and similarities ) and inter-language ( which describes l2 learners ’ language as a rule-governed , dynamic system ) ( mitchell , myles , 2004 ) in most cases , people never achieve the same level of fluency and comprehension in their second languages as in their first language as far as the relationship between age and eventual attainment in sla is concerned , krashen , long , and scarcella , say that people who encounter foreign language in early age , begin natural exposure to second languages and obtain better proficiency than those who learn the second language as an adult however , when it comes to the relationship between age and rate sla , “ adults proceed through early stages of syntactic and morphological development faster than children ( where time and exposure are held constant ) ” ( krashen , long , scarcella 573 ) also , “ older children acquire faster than younger children do ( again , in early stages of morphological and syntactic development where time and exposure are held constant ) ” ( 573 ) gauthier and genesee ( 2011 ) have done a research which mainly focuses on the second language acquisition of internationally adopted children and results show that early experiences of one language of children can affect their ability to acquire a second language , and usually children learn their second language slower and weaker even during the critical period as for the fluency , it is better to do foreign language education at an early age , but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a “ weak identification ” ( billiet , maddens and beerten 241 ) due to such factors , learning foreign languages at an early age may incur one ’ s perspective of his or her native country acquiring a second language can be a lifelong learning process for many however , children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of vocabulary and a few grammar structures , and the process is relatively very fast because language is a very complex skill moreover , if children start to learn a second language when they are 7 years old or younger , they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life error correction does not seem to have a direct influence on learning a second language in the learning of a second language the correction of errors remains a controversial topic with many differing schools of thought in the 1970s dulay and burt ’ s studies showed that learners acquire grammar forms and structures in a pre-determined , inalterable order , and that teaching or correcting styles would not change this ( russell , 2009 ) success in language learning can be measured in two ways : likelihood and quality as noted elsewhere , l2 learners rarely achieve complete native-like control of the second language
