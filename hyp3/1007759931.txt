cell migration requires the generation of forces , and when cancer cells transmigrate through the vasculature , this requires physical gaps in the blood vessels to form this novel finding meant that investigators gained the ability to track endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the blood to the tumor-stroma and even incorporated in tumor vasculature therefore , endothelial progenitor cells are important in tumor biology and present novel therapeutic targets the immune system is typically deregulated in cancer and affects many stages of tumor progression , including metastasis epigenetic regulation also plays an important role in the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells these epigenetic modifications in metastases may allow the proliferation and survival of disseminated tumor cells in distant organs for example , ovarian cancer can spread transperitoneally to the surface of the liver '' positive nodes '' is a term that would be used by medical specialists to describe regional lymph nodes that tested positive for malignancy however , often it remains unclear whether simultaneously diagnosed tumors of a canalicular system are one metastatic process or in fact independent tumors caused by the same agent ( field cancerization ) the propensity for a metastatic cell to spread to a particular organ is termed 'organotropism ' however , contemporary evidences indicate that the primary tumour may dictate organotropic metastases by inducing the formation of pre-metastatic niches at distant sites , where incoming metastatic cells may engraft and colonise it is theorized that metastasis always coincides with a primary cancer , and , as such , is a tumor that started from a cancer cell or cells in another part of the body however , over 10 % of patients presenting to oncology units will have metastases without a primary tumor found studies have shown that , if simple questioning does not reveal the cancer 's source ( coughing up blood— '' probably lung '' , urinating blood— '' probably bladder '' ) , complex imaging will not either once the cancerous tissue is examined under a microscope to determine the cell type , a doctor can usually tell whether that type of cell is normally found in the part of the body from which the tissue sample was taken so , if a tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung contains cells that look like breast cells , the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor when a second tumor is found in a patient that has been treated for cancer in the past , it is more often a metastasis than another primary tumor it was previously thought that most cancer cells have a low metastatic potential and that there are rare cells that develop the ability to metastasize through the development of somatic mutations rather , it seems that the genetic state of the primary tumor reflects the ability of that cancer to metastasize research comparing gene expression between primary and metastatic adenocarcinomas identified a subset of genes whose expression could distinguish primary tumors from metastatic tumors , dubbed a '' metastatic signature additionally , the metastatic-associated expression of these genes was also observed in some primary tumors , indicating that cells with the potential to metastasize could be identified concurrently with diagnosis of the primary tumor in aggressive cancer cells , loose dna fragments from unstable chromosomes spill in the cytosol leading to the chronic activation of innate immune pathways , which are hijacked by cancer cells to spread to distant organs additionally , the expression of these metastatic-associated genes was shown to apply to other cancer types in addition to adenocarcinoma the identification of this metastasis-associated signature provides promise for identifying cells with metastatic potential within the primary tumor and hope for improving the prognosis of these metastatic-associated cancers additionally , identifying the genes whose expression is changed in metastasis offers potential targets to inhibit metastasis although metastasis is widely accepted to be the result of the tumor cells migration , there is a hypothesis saying that some metastases are the result of inflammatory processes by abnormal immune cells the existence of metastatic cancers in the absence of primary tumors also suggests that metastasis is not always caused by malignant cells that leave primary tumors
