william keegan argues that the sites on caicos therefore represent a colonization after 1200 by tainos from hispaniola seeking salt from the natural salt pans on the island while trade ( in dugout canoes ) between cuba and long island was reported by columbus , this involved a voyage of at least over open water , although much of that was on the very shallow waters of the great bahama bank moreover , the tainos probably did not settle in central cuba until after 1000 , and there is no particular evidence that this was the route of the initial settlement of the bahamas craton:17 keegan:48–62 from an initial settlement of great inagua island , the lucayans expanded throughout the bahamas islands in some 800 years ( c population density at the time of first european contact was highest in the south central area of the bahamas , declining towards the north , reflecting the progressively shorter time of occupation of the northern islands from long island expansion would have gone east to rum cay and san salvador island , north to cat island and west to great and little exuma islands keegan:25 , 54–58 , 86 , 170–173 based on lucayan names for the islands , granberry and vescelius argue for two origins of settlement ; one from hispaniola to the turks and caicos islands through mayaguana and acklins and crooked islands to long island and the great and little exuma islands , and another from cuba through great inagua island , little inagua island and ragged island to long island and the exumas granberry & vescelius also state that around 1200 the turks and caicos islands were resettled from hispaniola and were thereafter part of the classical taino culture and language area , and no longer lucayan a piece of jadeite found on san salvador island appears to have originated in guatemala , based on a trace element analysis columbus thought the lucayans resembled the guanche of the canary islands ( in part because they were intermediate in skin color between europeans and africans ) classic taino villages in hispaniola and eastern cuba typically had houses arranged around a central plaza , and often located along rivers with access to good agricultural land on the other hand , lucayan villages were linear , along the coast , often on the leeward side of an island , but also found on the windward side wherever tidal creeks provided some protected shoreline some ( usually less than one percent of collected shards in most of the bahamas , about ten percent in the caicos islands ) sand-tempered pottery was imported from cuba and/or haiti one of the few artifacts of lucayan life that has been found in a variety of areas in the bahama archipelago is the duho the identity of the first american landfall by columbus remains contested , but many authors accept samuel e lucayans on san salvador had told columbus that he could find a '' king '' who had a lot of gold at the village of samaot ( also spelled samoet , saomete or saometo ) at one point he sought to reach samaot by sailing eastward , but the water was too shallow , and he felt that sailing around the island was '' a very long way '' keegan interprets this description to fit the acklins/crooked islands group , with a ship in the west side being able to see the western shore of acklins island across the very shallow waters of the bight of acklins , where there was a village that stretched about along the shore such finds , however , do not prove that spaniards visited those islands , as trade among lucayans could have distributed the artifacts spanish exploitation of the labor of the natives of hispaniola rapidly reduced that population , leading the governor of hispaniola to complain to the spanish crown after columbus 's death , ferdinand ii of aragon ordered in 1509 that indians be imported from nearby islands to make up the population losses in hispaniola , and the spanish began capturing lucayans in the bahamas for use as laborers in hispaniola within two years the southern bahamas were largely depopulated the spanish may have carried away as many as 40,000 lucayans by 1513 '' sauer:160 when the spanish decided to traffic the remaining lucayans to hispaniola in 1520 , they could find only eleven in all of the bahamas
