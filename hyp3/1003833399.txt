it has good thermal conductivity ( 62 btu/ft-deg.f-h ) 3-5 times more than tool steel these non-sparking features are best applied in explosive environments such as in the oil & gas and gun powder industries in solid form and as finished objects , beryllium copper presents no known health hazard thumb beryllium copper is a non-ferrous alloy used in springs , spring wire , load cells , and other parts that must retain their shape under repeated stress and strain an alternative metal sometimes used for non-sparking tools is aluminium bronze compared to steel tools , beryllium copper tools are more expensive and not as strong , but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages armour piercing bullets , though such usage is unusual because bullets made from steel alloys are much less expensive and have similar properties tempered wire is most useful where the properties of beryllium copper are desired , but age hardening of finished parts is not practical c17510 and c17500 beryllium copper alloys are age-hardenable and provide good electrical conductivity , physical properties , and endurance they are used in springs and wire where electrical conduction or retention of properties at elevated temperatures is important the hardening process requires rapid cooling of the annealed metal , resulting in a solid state solution of beryllium in copper , which is then kept at 200-460 Â°c for at least an hour , producing a precipitation of metastable beryllide crystals in the copper matrix the thermal conductivity of these alloys is greater than aluminium and slightly less than pure copper and are often used as electrical contacts .
