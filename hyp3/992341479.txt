when a nuclear chain reaction in a mass of fissile material is self-sustaining , the mass is said to be in a critical state in which there is no increase or decrease in power , temperature , or neutron population a numerical measure of a critical mass is dependent on the effective neutron multiplication factor , the average number of neutrons released per fission event that go on to cause another fission event rather than being absorbed or leaving the material for example , a spherical critical mass of pure uranium-235 ( 235 u ) with a mass of about would experience around 15 & nbsp ; spontaneous fission events per second the probability that one such event will cause a chain reaction depends on how much the mass exceeds the critical mass the mass where criticality occurs may be changed by modifying certain attributes such as fuel , shape , temperature , density and the installation of a neutron-reflective substance if the perfect quantity of fuel were added to a slightly subcritical mass to create an '' exactly critical mass '' , fission would be self-sustaining for only one neutron generation ( fuel consumption then makes the assembly subcritical again ) if the perfect quantity of fuel were added to a slightly subcritical mass , to create a barely supercritical mass , the temperature of the assembly would increase to an initial maximum ( for example : 1 & nbsp ; k above the ambient temperature ) and then decrease back to the ambient temperature after a period of time , because fuel consumed during fission brings the assembly back to subcriticality once again a mass may be exactly critical without being a perfect homogeneous sphere a mass may be exactly critical at a particular temperature as fuel temperature increases , neutrons of a given energy appear faster and thus fission/absorption is less likely thermal expansion associated with temperature increase also contributes a negative coefficient of reactivity since fuel atoms are moving farther apart the density of a material at a constant temperature can be changed by varying the pressure or tension or by changing crystal structure ( see allotropes of plutonium ) changing the temperature may also change the density ; however , the effect on critical mass is then complicated by temperature effects ( see '' changing the temperature '' ) and by whether the material expands or contracts with increased temperature because a bomb relies on fast neutrons ( not ones moderated by reflection with light elements , as in a reactor ) , the neutrons reflected by a tamper are slowed by their collisions with the tamper nuclei , and because it takes time for the reflected neutrons to return to the fissile core , they take rather longer to be absorbed by a fissile nucleus the critical size is the minimum size of a nuclear reactor core or nuclear weapon that can be made for a specific geometrical arrangement and material composition if the size of the reactor core is less than a certain minimum , too many fission neutrons escape through its surface and the chain reaction is not sustained this is something that must be taken into consideration when attempting more precise estimates of critical masses of plutonium isotopes than the approximate values given above , because plutonium metal has a large number of different crystal phases which can have widely varying densities in any case , criticality then depends upon a typical neutron '' seeing '' an amount of nuclei around it such that the areal density of nuclei exceeds a certain threshold this is applied in implosion-type nuclear weapons where a spherical mass of fissile material that is substantially less than a critical mass is made supercritical by very rapidly increasing ρ ( and thus σ as well ) ( see below ) detonation is produced by exploding a shaped charge surrounding the sphere , increasing the density ( and collapsing the cavity , if present ) to produce a prompt critical configuration the event of fission must release , on the average , more than one free neutron of the desired energy level in order to sustain a chain reaction , and each must find other nuclei and cause them to fission physicists recognize two points in the gradual increase of neutron flux which are significant : critical , where the chain reaction becomes self-sustaining thanks to the contributions of both kinds of neutron generation , in the description of the soviet equivalent of the cp1 startup at the university of chicago in 1942 , the long waits for those tardy neutrons is described in detail and prompt critical , where the immediate '' prompt '' neutrons alone will sustain the reaction without need for the decay neutrons
