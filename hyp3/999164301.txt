geoid the geoid surface is irregular , unlike the reference ellipsoid ( which is a mathematical idealized representation of the physical earth ) , but is considerably smoother than earth 's physical surface the permanent deviation between the geoid and mean sea level is called ocean surface topography in reality , the geoid does not have a physical meaning under the continents , but geodesists are able to derive the heights of continental points above this imaginary , yet physically defined , surface by spirit leveling conversely , height determined by spirit leveling from a tidal measurement station , as in traditional land surveying , is always geoidal height an oblate spheroid is typically used as the idealized earth , but even if the earth were spherical and did not rotate , the strength of gravity would not be the same everywhere because density varies throughout the planet instead , the water level would be higher or lower with respect to earth 's center , depending on the strength of gravity in that location the geoid level coincides with where the water would be the undulation is not standardized , as different countries use different mean sea levels as reference , but most commonly refers to the egm96 geoid in maps and common use the height over the mean sea level ( such as orthometric height ) is used to indicate the height of elevations while the ellipsoidal height results from the gps system and similar gnss their solution enables millimetre-to-centimetre accuracy in geoid computation , an order of magnitude improvement from previous classical solutions variations in the height of the geoidal surface are related to density anomalous distributions within the earth geoid measures thus help understanding the internal structure of the planet mantle convection also changes the shape of the geoid over time
