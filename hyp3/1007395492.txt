the following year draize joined the fda , and was soon promoted to head of the dermal and ocular toxicity branch where he was charged with developing methods for testing the side effects of cosmetic products this work culminated in a report by draize , his laboratory assistant , geoffrey woodard , and division chief , herbert calvery , describing how to assess acute , intermediate , and chronic exposure to cosmetics by applying compounds to the skin , penis , and eyes of rabbits by draize 's retirement in 1963 , and despite never having personally attached his name to any technique , irritancy procedures were commonly known as '' the draize test '' to distinguish the target organ , the tests are now often referred to as '' the draize eye test '' and '' the draize skin test '' according to the american national anti-vivisection society , solutions of products are applied directly into the animals ' eyes , which can cause '' intense burning , itching and pain according to the british research defence society , the draize eye test is now a '' very mild test , '' in which small amounts of substances are used and are washed out of the eye at the first sign of irritation in a letter to nature , written to refute an article saying that the draize test had not changed much since the 1940s , andrew huxley wrote : '' a substance expected from its chemical nature to be seriously painful must not be tested in this way ; the test is permissible only if the substance has already been shown not to cause pain when applied to skin , and in vitro pre-screening tests are recommended , such as a test on an isolated and perfused eye he also reported that differences in anatomy and biochemistry between the rabbit and human eye indicate that testing substances on rabbits might not predict the effects on humans harbell , '' ocular safety : a silent ( in vitro ) success story '' , atla 30 , supplement 2 , 69-74 , 2002 however , since 2000 oecd had validated alternative tests for corrosivity , meaning acids , bases and other corrosive substances are no longer required to be draize tested on animals the alternative tests include a human skin equivalent model and the transepicutaneous resistance test ( ter ) in addition , the use of human corneal cell line ( hce-t cells ) is also another good alternative method to test eye irritation on potential chemicals in september 2009 the oecd validated two alternatives to the draize eye test : the bovine cornea opacity test ( bcop ) and isolated chicken eye test ( ice ) a 1995 study funded by the european commission and british home office evaluated these among nine potential replacements , including the hens ' egg chorioallantoic membrane ( het-cam ) assay and an epithelial model cultivated from human corneal cells , in comparison with draize test data the study found that none of the alternative tests , taken alone , proved to be a reliable replacement for the animal test , however a post hoc post-hoc analysis found that in certain combinations of tests , an '' excellent performance '' was observed positive results from some of these tests have been accepted by regulatory bodies , such as the british health and safety executive and us department of health and human services , without testing on live animals , but negative results ( no irritation ) required further in vivo testing in britain , the home office publishes guideline for eye irritancy tests , with the aim of reducing suffering to the animals the test design requires that the substance be tested on one rabbit initially , and the effect of the substance on the skin must be ascertained before it can be introduced into the eye in tests where severe eye irritancy is considered likely , a washout should closely follow testing in the eye of the first rabbit freeberg fe , hooker dt , griffith jf : correlation of animal eye test data with human experience for household products : an update griffith jf , freeberg fe : empirical and experimental bases for selecting the low volume eye irritation test as the validation standard for in vitro methods
