enhancements included a faster 60x system bus ( 66 & nbsp ; mhz ) , larger l1 caches ( 32 kb instruction and 32 kb data ) , a second integer unit , an enhanced floating point unit , and higher core frequency in 1999 , ibm fabricated versions in a 0.20 & nbsp ; μm process with copper interconnects , which increased the frequency up to 500 & nbsp ; mhz and decreased power consumption to 6 & nbsp ; w and the die size to 40 & nbsp ; mm 2 the processor has 10.4 million transistors , is manufactured by bae systems using either 250 or 150 & nbsp ; nm process and has a die area of 130 & nbsp ; mm² the rad750 packaging and logic functions has a price tag in excess of us 200,000 : the high price is mainly due to radiation hardening revisions to the powerpc 750 architecture and manufacturing , stringent quality control requirements , and extended testing of each processor chip manufactured it is based on a powerpc 750cxe and adds about 50 new instructions as well as a modified fpu capable of some simd functionality it also featured a number of improvements to the memory subsystem : an enhanced and faster ( 200 & nbsp ; mhz ) 60x bus controller , a wider l2 cache bus , and the ability to lock parts of the l2 cache it was the last g3 type processor used by apple ( employed on the ibook g3 ) it has an on-die 1 & nbsp ; mb l2 cache , a top frequency of 1.1 & nbsp ; ghz , and support for bus speeds up to 200 & nbsp ; mhz among other enhancements compared to 750fx it would be the most powerful and featured version to date with up to 4mb of off die l3 cache , a 400mhz ddr front side bus and the same implementation of altivec used in the powerpc 970 it was expected to clock as high as 1.8 & nbsp ; ghz ( starting at 1.5 & nbsp ; ghz ) and reported to have additional pipeline stages , and advanced power management features the 750cl is an evolved 750cxe , with speeds ranging from 400 & nbsp ; mhz to 1 & nbsp ; ghz with a system bus up to 240 & nbsp ; mhz , l2 cache prefetch features and graphics related instructions have been added to improve performance as the added graphics-related functions match closely the ones found in the gekko processor it is very likely that the 750cl is a shrink of the same processor for general purpose use the cpu in wii is virtually identical to the 750cl but it runs at 729 & nbsp ; mhz , a frequency not supported by stock 750cl this is smaller than half the size of the '' gekko '' microprocessor ( 43 & nbsp ; mm 2 ) incorporated in the gamecube at its first release the largely unconfirmed characteristics are a triple core cpu which runs at 1.24 & nbsp ; ghz and is manufactured on a 45 & nbsp ; nm process however ibm did make the espresso processor for nintendo , which is a 750 based design with improvements such as multiprocessor support ( the part is a triple core ) , new 45 & nbsp ; nm fabrication process and edram instead of regular l2 cache ; it 's unknown if further changes were made to the design
