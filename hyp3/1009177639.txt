as champan ports attracted local and foreign traders , champan fleets also controlled the trade in spices and silk in the south china sea , between china , the indonesian archipelago and india however , the rising influence of champa caught the attention of a neighbouring thalassocracy that considered champa as a rival , the javanese ( javaka , probably refers to srivijaya ruler of malay peninsula , sumatra and java ) though cham territory included the mountainous zones west of the coastal plain and ( at times ) extended into present-day laos , for the most part , the cham remained a seafaring people dedicated to trade , and maintained few settlements of any size away from the coast historical champa consisted of up to five principalities : indrapura ( '' city of indra '' ) was the capital of champa from about ad 875 to about ad 1000 also found in the region of da nang is the ancient cham city of singhapura ( '' city of the lion '' ) , the location of which has been identified with an archaeological site in the modern village of trà kiệu , and the valley of mỹ sơn , where a number of ruined temples and towers can still be seen vijaya became the political and cultural centre of champa around ad 1000 , when the northern capital of indrapura was abandoned due to pressure from the viet balamon chams adhere to the old religion of their ancestor , an indigenized form of hinduism that thrived since the ancient era of kingdom of champa in 5th century ce while today the bacam ( bacham ) are the only surviving hindus in vietnam , the region once hosted some of the most exquisite and vibrant hinduism in the world the entire region of southeast asia , in fact , was home to numerous sophisticated hindu kingdoms by the 17th century , the royal families of the cham had converted to islam indonesian 15th century records indicate the influence of princess daravati , a cham , converted to islam , and influenced her husband , kertawijaya , majapahit 's seventh ruler to convert the majapahit royal family to islam as seafaring people , the cham were highly mobile and established a network of trade including not only the major ports at hội an , thi nai but also extending into the mountainous hinterland khu túc ( known in chinese sources as qusu ) located along the kiến giang river of quảng bình province , was built in the 4th century ad and includes a revetted wall and moat as do the other centers art of champa history of vietnam kampong cham province in east cambodia kingdom of champasak in the south of laos king of champa champa independence movement website of the asia research institute , including the working paper '' champa revised '' by michael vickery , and the draft translation '' champa in the song hui-yao '' by geoff wade the survivors of a lost civilisation cham muslims : a look at cambodia 's muslim minority photos of cham art exhibited in vietnamese museums plumeria flowers & nbsp ;
