paranoia is a humorous role-playing game set in a dystopia similar to nineteen eighty-four , brave new world , logan 's run , and thx 1138 ; however , the tone of the game is rife with black humor , frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy as a result , paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed , yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game the paranoia rulebook is unusual in a number of ways ; demonstrating any knowledge of the rules is forbidden , and most of the rulebook is written in an easy , conversational tone that often makes fun of the players and their characters , while occasionally taking digs at other notable role-playing games the actual societies which would be encountered in a game depends on the play style ; some societies are more suited for more light-hearted games ( zap-style , or the lighter end of classic ) , whereas others represent a more serious threat to alpha complex and are therefore more suitable for straight or the more dark sort of classic games in addition to these six published editions , it is known that west end games were working on a '' third edition '' - to replace the poorly received fifth edition - in the late 1990s , but their financial issues would prevent this edition from being published , except for being included in one tournament adventure this edition can be seen as a response to the natural development of the line towards a rules-light , fast and entertaining play style many of the supplements released for the second edition fall into a story arc set up by new writers and line editors that was intended to freshen up the game and broaden roleplay possibilities while they undoubtedly did so , giving roleplayers the opportunity to transcend time and space , play in a post-apocalyptic computerless alpha complex , or play in a post-post-apocalyptic alpha complex in which the computer battled for control with other factions , many fans felt these new settings ran counter to the spirit of the game in particular , many felt the removal of the computer - and thus the power structure associated with it - and the greater freedom given to player characters effectively wrecked the very premise of the game , which required that player characters had little freedom , had to appease the demands of the computer , and were presented with insane situations that arose from the ludicrous rules of alpha complex society individual missions can be run in the classic format , but running themes and conspiracies persist from book to book ( the game skipped two editions as a joke , and possibly also as a reference to the two major revisions to the game released during the lifetime of the second edition with the crash course manual and the paranoia sourcebook in his introduction to flashbacks , a compilation of paranoia adventures from the west end games era , allen varney fully details the management decisions which led , in the eyes of many , to the decline of the paranoia line , and cites rumours that the line saw a 90 % decline in sales before west end games went into bankruptcy : art director larry catalano left west end in 1986 this edition of the game has received a much warmer critical reception , as well as selling well this edition also introduced three different styles of play , with some game mechanics differing between the various modes to support the specific tone being sought-after : zap is anarchic slapstick with no claims to making sense and little effort at satire straight represents a relatively new style for paranoia , although it is not entirely without precedent in the darker portions of the original 1st edition rules primary designer allen varney , in the designer 's notes , explained that his aim with the new edition was to return to the game 's roots whilst updating both the game system and the satirical setting to take account of twenty years of game design progress in both the core rulebook and the flashbacks supplement - a reprint of classic adventures originally published by west end games - varney was highly critical of west end games ' handling of the product line in its latter days in a posting on rpg.net he explained that the point of including the three playstyles in paranoia xp was to counteract the impression that '' zap '' -styled play was the default for paranoia , an impression which had in part been created by the more cartoonish later supplements in the west end games line ( as well as '' fifth edition '' ) in order to distance the new edition from the less commercially and critically successful aspects of the west end game line , and to discourage new players from wasting time and money on what he considered to be inferior products , varney additionally used the designer 's notes to declare many west end products , including the '' fifth edition '' and everything published for the 2nd edition after the people 's glorious revolutionary adventure , to be '' unproducts '' - no longer part of the game 's continuity , and not recommended for use with the new edition an upshot of this is that much of the poorly received metaplot established late in the west end games line , from the secret society wars to the reboot and beyond , was disposed of he has also stated that he personally has little affection for the '' zap '' style , and therefore may have given it short shrift in the main rulebook , although later supplements for paranoia xp did provide more support for zap play paranoia xp marked his return to the line as well ; he has designed every cover of the xp edition , and many books contain both his classic and new paranoia art while paranoia xp kept communists as the big bad scapegoat in spite of the cold war being long over , the updated edition integrates several 21st century themes into its satire in addition , varney ran an online game , the toothpaste disaster , where players took the role of high programmers documenting the titular disaster in a lexicon format later , some of the best players and writers from the game and a few other places were formally integrated as the traitor recycling studio to write official paranoia material ; their first credited work was the mission supplement crash priority ) the idea of devising new and varied concepts to base paranoia adventures and campaigns around would be revisited for the next edition of the game in june 2009 , mongoose publishing announced that they would be retiring the books in the xp line to clear the way for the 25th anniversary edition line - revealing a new edition of the rulebook as well as two new rulebooks , one casting the players as higher-clearance internal security investigators and one as ultraviolet high programmers the troubleshooters volume presents a slimmed-down version of the xp rules , the most notable difference being the removal of the service firms and the advanced economy of the xp edition , with the focus firmly on the game 's traditional premise of casting the player characters as red-clearance troubleshooters the internal security volume casts the player characters as blue-clearance internal security agents , a refinement of the premise of the 1st edition supplement hil sector blues ( reprinted in the xp line as part of extreme paranoia ) allen varney , designer of the xp edition , explained in a posting on rpg.net that this decision came about as a result of the xp edition successfully convincing the wider gaming public that '' zap '' was not the default playstyle for the game ; since it was now generally accepted that paranoia could have a variety of playstyles and each gm would interpret it somewhat differently , it was considered no longer necessary to emphasise the different playstyles in the main text it 's the sort of concept which works well as light relief from a 'serious ' rpg campaign , and will definitely appeal to 'hack and slay ' merchants '' in the april 1988 edition of dragon ( issue 132 ) , jim bambra thought that the second edition had marked improvements compared to the first edition : '' the first edition of paranoia ] promised hilarious fun and a combat system that didn â€™ t get bogged down in tedious mechanics it soon found a following among gamers looking for something different in their role-playing adventures in september 2004 , both attracted some mainstream attention when the uk edition of pc gamer magazine ran an article about paranoia as one of their '' extra life '' columns and showcased jparanoia and paranoia live ; coincidentally the publicity came right before the site was poised to celebrate the launch of the new paranoia edition from mongoose paranoia was also made into a video game called the paranoia complex released in 1989 by magic bytes
