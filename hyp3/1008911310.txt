the term '' blackhole '' refers to a networking black hole , an expression for a link on a network that drops incoming traffic instead of forwarding it normally the intent of the rbl was that sites using it would refuse traffic from sites which supported spam — whether by actively sending spam , or in other ways such effort was considered very important before blackholing all network traffic , but it also meant that spammers and spam supporting isps could delay being put on the rbl for long periods while such discussions went on these allowed the mail software to query the rbl and reject mail from listed sites on a per-mail-server basis instead of blackholing all traffic uri dnsbls were created when it was determined that much spam made it past spam filters during that short time frame between the first use of a spam-sending ip address and the point where that sending ip address was first listed on major sending-ip-based dnsbls rhsbls are of debatable effectiveness since many spams either use forged '' from '' addresses or use '' from '' addresses containing popular freemail domain names , such as gmail.com , yahoo.com , or hotmail.com uri dnsbls are more widely used than rhsbls , are very effective , and are used by the majority of spam filters to operate a dnsbl requires three things : a domain to host it under , a nameserver for that domain , and a list of addresses to publish when a mail server receives a connection from a client , and wishes to check that client against a dnsbl ( let 's say , dnsbl.example.net ) , it does more or less the following : take the client 's ip address—say , 192.168.42.23—and reverse the order of octets , yielding 23.42.168.192 this will return either an address , indicating that the client is listed ; or an '' nxdomain '' ( '' no such domain '' ) code , indicating that the client is not looking up an address in a dnsbl is thus similar to looking it up in reverse-dns other addresses in this block may indicate something specific about the listing—that it indicates an open relay , proxy , spammer-owned host , etc ; white list : a listing is an affirmative indication of essentially absolute trust ; black list : a listing is a negative indication of essentially absolute distrust ; grey list : most frequently seen as one word ( greylist or greylisting ) not involving dnsbls directly , but using temporary deferral of mail from unfamiliar sources to allow for the development of a public reputation ( such as dnsbl listings ) or to discourage speed-focused spamming ; nobl list : a listing indicates that the source is believed to send no spam and should not be subjected to blacklist testing , but is not quite as trusted as a whitelisted source most message transfer agents ( mta ) as of july 2016 , 30 out of 41 mtas listed in comparison of mail servers antispam features are known to support dnsbl , 1 does n't , and the remaining 10 are not known can be configured to absolutely block or ( less commonly ) to accept email based on a dnsbl listing a drawback of using the direct dnsbl support in most mtas is that sources not on any list require checking all of the dnsbls being used with relatively little utility to caching the negative results this allows for the use of rules that act ( by whatever criteria are available in the specific software ) to '' whitelist '' mail that would otherwise be rejected due to a dnsbl listing or due to other rules this can also have the problem of heavy dns lookup load for no useful results , but it may not delay mail as much because scoring makes it possible for lookups to be done in parallel and asynchronously while the filter is checking the message against the other rules one way to do this is to first check white lists and accept the message if the source is on a white list , bypassing all other testing mechanisms end-users assigned to that same shared mailserver may find their emails blocked by receiving mailservers using such a dnsbl this type of dnsbl lists ip addresses submitted by isps as dynamic and therefore presumably unsuitable to send email directly ; the end-user is supposed to use the isp 's mailserver for all sending of email but these lists can also accidentally include static addresses , which may be legitimately used by small-business owners or other end-users to host small email servers for example , the uceprotect dnsbl seems to list ip addresses merely once they have validated a recipient address or established a tcp connection , even if no spam message is ever delivered
