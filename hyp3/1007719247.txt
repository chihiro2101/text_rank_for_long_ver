the xmpp network architecture is reminiscent of the simple mail transfer protocol ( smtp ) , a clientâ€“server model ; clients do not talk directly to one another as it is decentralized - anyone can run a server jids without a username part are also valid , and may be used for system messages and control of special features on the server the means to route messages based on a logical endpoint identifier - the jid , instead of by an explicit ip address present opportunities to use xmpp as an overlay network implementation on top of different underlay networks as an alternative to the tcp transport , the xmpp community has also developed an http transport for web clients as well as users behind restricted firewalls xmpp applications beyond im include : chat rooms , network management , content syndication , collaboration tools , file sharing , gaming , remote systems control and monitoring , geolocation , middleware and cloud computing , voip , and identity services building on its capability to support discovery across local network domains , xmpp is well-suited for cloud computing where virtual machines , networks , and firewalls would otherwise present obstacles to alternative service discovery and presence-based solutions since xml is text based , normal xmpp has a higher network overhead compared to purely binary solutions using the extension called jingle , xmpp can provide an open means to support machine to machine or peer-to-peer communications across a diverse set of networks one of the original design goals of the early jabber open-source community was enabling users to connect to multiple instant messaging systems ( especially non-xmpp systems ) through a single client application unlike instant messaging , xmpp provides this access at the server level by communicating via special gateway services running alongside an xmpp server any user can '' register '' with one of these gateways by providing the information needed to log on to that network , and can then communicate with users of that network as though they were xmpp users as a result , any client that fully supports xmpp can access any network with a gateway without extra code in the client , and without the need for the client to have direct access to the internet a large number of xmpp client software exist on various modern and legacy platforms , including both graphical and command line based clients specialized xmpp hosting services also exist in form of cloud so that domain owners need not directly run their own xmpp servers , including cisco webex connect , chrome.pl , flosoft.biz , i-pobox.net , and hosted.im xmpp is also used in deployments of non-im services , including smart grid systems such as demand response applications , message-oriented middleware , and as a replacement for sms to provide text messaging on many smartphone clients some of the largest messaging providers use , or have been using , various forms of xmpp based protocols in their backend systems without necessarily exposing this fact to their end users one example is google , which in august 2005 introduced google talk , a combination voip and im system that uses xmpp for instant messaging and as a base for a voice and file transfer signaling protocol called jingle in january 2008 , aol introduced experimental xmpp support for its aim ( software ) ( aim ) service , allowing aim users to communicate using xmpp two notable exceptions are steam and xbox live ; both use their own proprietary messaging protocols from 1999 until february 2006 , the service used jabberd as its server software , at which time it migrated to ejabberd ( both of which are free software application servers ) the following extensions are in especially wide use : data forms service discovery multi-user chat publish-subscribe and personal eventing protocol xhtml-im file transfer entity capabilities http binding jingle for voice and video xmpp features such as federation across domains , publish/subscribe , authentication and its security even for mobile endpoints are being used to implement the internet of things the xmpp extensions for publish-subscribe provide many of the same features as the advanced message queuing protocol ( amqp ) .
