it prevents cells from assembling various amino acids into proteins according to the messages it receives from messenger rna in a process conducted by the cell 's ribosome ( the protein-making machinery ) – that is , the most basic level of cell metabolism , essential to all living cells and thus to life itself because the symptoms are caused by failure to make protein , they may take anywhere from hours to days to appear , depending on the route of exposure and the dose within two to five days of exposure to ricin , effects of ricin on the central nervous system , adrenal glands , kidneys , and liver appear an antidote has been developed by the uk military , although it has not yet been tested on humans another antidote developed by the us military has been shown to be safe and effective in lab mice injected with antibody-rich blood mixed with ricin , and has had some human testing death typically occurs within 3–5 days of exposure vaccination is possible by injecting an inactive form of protein chain a this vaccination is effective for several months due to the body 's production of antibodies to the foreign protein for this reason only small amounts of ricin had leaked out of the pellet , producing some symptoms but allowing his body to develop immunity to further poisoning the extracted oil is also heated to more than to denature any ricin that may be present rauber and heard have written that close examination of early 20th century case reports indicates that public and professional perceptions of ricin toxicity '' do not accurately reflect the capabilities of modern medical management '' most acute poisoning episodes in humans are the result of oral ingestion of castor beans , 5–20 of which could prove fatal to an adult although no approved therapeutics are currently based on ricin , it does have the potential to be used in the chemotherapy , as a '' magic bullet '' to destroy targeted cells the major problem with ricin is that its native endocytosis sequences are distributed throughout the protein modifying ricin may sufficiently lessen the likelihood that the ricin component of these immunotoxins will cause the wrong cells to internalize it , while still retaining its cell-killing activity when it is internalized by the targeted cells in the us , ricin appears on the select agents list of the department of health and human services , and scientists must register with hhs to use ricin in their research ricin is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the united states as defined in section 302 of the us emergency planning and community right-to-know act ( 42 u.s.c rand corporation , at that time it was being considered for use either as a toxic dust or as a coating for bullets and shrapnel though there were plans for mass production and several field trials with different bomblet concepts , the end conclusion was that it was no more economical than using phosgene this conclusion was based on comparison of the final weapons , rather than ricin 's toxicity ( ld50 ~10 & nbsp ; mg/min/m 3 ) in spite of ricin 's extreme toxicity and utility as an agent of chemical/biological warfare , production of the toxin is difficult to limit 50 over a large geographic area is significantly more than an agent such as anthrax ( tons of ricin vs ricin is easy to produce , but is not as practical or likely to cause as many casualties as other agents once deployed , an area contaminated with ricin remains dangerous until the bonds between chain a or b have been broken , a process that takes two or three days in contrast , anthrax spores may remain lethal for decades jan van aken , a german expert on biological weapons , explained in a report for the sunshine project that al qaeda ’ s experiments with ricin suggest their inability to produce botulinum or anthrax however , it was believed at the time that bulgaria would not have been able to produce the pellet , and it was also believed that the kgb had supplied it authorities later confirmed it contained ricin ; no detrimental exposures were identified the popularity of breaking bad inspired several real-life criminal cases involving ricin or similar substances
