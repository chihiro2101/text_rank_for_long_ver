contact carriers that hold the parts of a connector together are usually made of plastic , due to its insulating properties whilst technically inaccurate , electrical connectors can be viewed as a type of adapter to convert between two connection methods , which are permanently connected at one end and ( usually ) detachable at the other end in this example , the solder tabs connected to the cable represent the permanent connection , whilst the male connector portion interfaces with a female socket forming a detachable connection there are many ways of applying a connector to a cable or device plug and socket connectors are usually made up of a male plug ( typically pin contacts ) and a female socket ( typically receptacle contacts ) often , but not always , sockets are permanently fixed to a device as in a chassis connector , and plugs are attached to a cable some connector styles may combine pin and socket connection types in a single unit , referred to as a hermaphroditic connector according to the asme , the stationary ( more fixed ) connector of a pair is classified as a jack ( denoted j ) , usually attached to a piece of equipment as in a chassis-mount or panel-mount connector the movable ( less fixed ) connector is classified as a plug ( denoted p ) , designed to attach to a wire , cable or removable electrical assembly crimped connectors are a type of solderless connection , using mechanical friction and uniform deformation to secure a connector to a pre-stripped wire ( usually stranded ) when wires are to be soldered to the back of a connector , a backshell is often used to protect the connection and add strain relief since stripping insulation from wires is time-consuming , many connectors intended for rapid assembly use insulation-displacement connectors which cut the insulation as the wire is inserted insulation displacement connectors are usually used with small conductors for signal purposes and at low voltage power conductors carrying more than a few amperes are more reliably terminated with other means , though '' hot tap '' press-on connectors find some use in automotive applications for additions to existing wiring a common example is the multi-conductor flat ribbon cable used in computer disk drives ; to terminate each of the many ( approximately 40 ) wires individually would be slow and error-prone , but an insulation displacement connector can terminate all the wires in a single action another very common use is so-called punch-down blocks used for terminating unshielded twisted pair wiring screw connections are frequently used for semi-permanent wiring and connections inside devices , due to their simple but reliable construction left terminal blocks ( also called terminal boards or strips ) provide a convenient means of connecting individual electrical wires without a splice or physically joining the ends since terminal blocks are readily available for a wide range of wire sizes and terminal quantity , they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available in some cases the blade is an integral manufactured part of a component ( such as a switch or a speaker unit ) , and the reciprocal connector is pushed onto the device 's connector
