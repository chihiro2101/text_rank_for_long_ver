he spoke of a journey to the land of the dead and of promises made to him by the souls of the recently deceased they promised to return to their loved ones within a period of three to four years he continued preaching this message for three years with the help of a local '' weather doctor '' named tavibo , father of jack wilson by the time of his studies the only dances he was allowed to witness were social dances or ones that had already incorporated christian elements , making investigation of the round dance 's origin complicated it was reportedly not his first time experiencing a vision ; but as a young adult , he claimed that he was then better equipped , spiritually , to handle this message jack had received training from an experienced holy man under his parents ' guidance after they realized that he was having difficulty interpreting his previous visions according to mooney , wilson 's letter said he stood before god in heaven and had seen many of his ancestors engaged in their favorite pastimes , and that god showed wilson a beautiful land filled with wild game and instructed him to return home to tell his people that they must love each other and not fight he also stated that jesus was being reincarnated on earth in 1892 , that the people must work , not steal or lie , and that they must not engage in the old practices of war or the traditional self-mutilation practices connected with mourning the dead he said that if his people abided by these rules , they would be united with their friends and family in the other world , and in god 's presence , there would be no sickness , disease , or old age mooney writes that wilson was given the ghost dance and commanded to take it back to his people jack wilson claimed to have left the presence of god convinced that if every indian in the west danced the new dance to '' hasten the event '' , all evil in the world would be swept away , leaving a renewed earth filled with food , love , and faith through indians and some white settlers , wilson 's message spread across much of the western portion of the united states the ghost dance was also investigated by many mormons from utah , for whom the concepts of the indian prophet were familiar and often accepted scholars believe that in 1890 chief kicking bear introduced the concept to his people , the lakota , kehoe , the ghost dance , p the government was accommodating white homesteaders from the eastern united states ; in addition , it intended to '' break up tribal relationships '' and '' conform indians to the white man 's ways , peaceably if they will , or forcibly if they must '' unfortunately , this was also the time when the government 's patience with supporting the so-called '' lazy indians '' ran out those who had been residing in the area for a long time recognized that the ritual was often held shortly before battle was to occur kicking bear was forced to leave standing rock , but when the dances continued unabated , agent james mclaughlin asked for more troops the following day , during an attempt by the officers to collect weapons from the band , one young , deaf lakota warrior refused to relinquish his arms following the wounded knee massacre , interest and participation in the ghost dance movement dropped dramatically for fear of continued violence against practitioners like most indian ceremonies , it became clandestine rather than dying out completely despite the widespread acceptance of the ghost dance movement , navajo leaders described the ghost dance as '' worthless words '' in 1890 three years later , james mooney arrived at the navajo reservation in northern arizona during his study of the ghost dance movement and found the navajo never incorporated the ritual into their society wovoka continued to spread its message , along with kicking bear , short bull and other spiritual leaders
