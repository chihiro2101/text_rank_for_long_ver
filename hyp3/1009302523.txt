in most vertebrates and some molluscs , the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells at the end of the eye , known as the retina such eyes are typically roughly spherical , filled with a transparent gel-like substance called the vitreous humour , with a focusing lens and often an iris ; the relaxing or tightening of the muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil , thereby regulating the amount of light that enters the eye , and reducing aberrations when there is enough light biomedia associates educational biology site : what animal has a more sophisticated eye , octopus or insect ? compound eyes are found among the arthropods and are composed of many simple facets which , depending on the details of anatomy , may give either a single pixelated image or multiple images , per eye some arthropods , including many strepsiptera , have compound eyes of only a few facets , each with a retina capable of creating an image , creating vision with each eye viewing a different thing , a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain , providing very different , high-resolution images for example , jumping spiders have a large pair of simple eyes with a narrow field of view , supported by an array of other , smaller eyes for peripheral vision some insect larvae , like caterpillars , have a different type of simple eye ( stemmata ) which usually provides only a rough image , but ( as in sawfly larvae ) can possess resolving powers of 4 degrees of arc , be polarization-sensitive and capable of increasing its absolute sensitivity at night by a factor of 1,000 or more there are ten different eye layouts—indeed every technological method of capturing an optical image commonly used by human beings , with the exceptions of zoom and fresnel lenses , occur in nature eye types can be categorised into '' simple eyes '' , with one concave photoreceptive surface , and '' compound eyes '' , which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface pit eyes , also known as stemma , are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot , to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light found in about 85 % of phyla , these basic forms were probably the precursors to more advanced types of '' simple eyes '' the ocelli of insects bear a simple lens , but their focal point usually lies behind the retina ; consequently , those ca n't form a sharp image ocelli ( pit-type eyes of arthropods ) blur the image across the whole retina , and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field ; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain this fast response has led to suggestions that the ocelli of insects are used mainly in flight , because they can be used to detect sudden changes in which way is up ( because light , especially uv light which is absorbed by vegetation , usually comes from above ) thus , animals that have evolved with a wide field-of-view often have eyes that make use of an inhomogeneous lens there is at least one vertebrate , the spookfish , whose eyes include reflective optics for focusing of light each of the two eyes of a spookfish collects light from both above and below ; the light coming from above is focused by a lens , while that coming from below , by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals the image perceived is a combination of inputs from the numerous ommatidia ( individual '' eye units '' ) , which are located on a convex surface , thus pointing in slightly different directions compared with simple eyes , compound eyes possess a very large view angle , and can detect fast movement and , in some cases , the polarisation of light to see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes , humans would require very large compound eyes , around in radius compound eyes fall into two groups : apposition eyes , which form multiple inverted images , and superposition eyes , which form a single erect image ) apposition eyes work by gathering a number of images , one from each eye , and combining them in the brain , with each eye typically contributing a single point of information this type of compound eye , for which a minimal size exists below which effective superposition can not occur , is normally found in nocturnal insects , because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent apposition eyes , though at the cost of reduced resolution another kind of compound eye , found in males of order strepsiptera , employs a series of simple eyes—eyes having one opening that provides light for an entire image-forming retina because each eyelet is a simple eye , it produces an inverted image ; those images are combined in the brain to form one unified image because the aperture of an eyelet is larger than the facets of a compound eye , this arrangement allows vision under low light levels this occurs because the ommatidia which one observes '' head-on '' ( along their optical axis ) absorb the incident light , while those to one side reflect it some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye , a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes the resulting eye is a mixture of a simple eye within a compound eye the tube feet of sea urchins contain photoreceptor proteins , which together act as a compound eye ; they lack screening pigments , but can detect the directionality of light by the shadow cast by its opaque body hence multiple eye types and subtypes developed in parallel ( except those of groups , such as the vertebrates , that were only forced into the photopic environment at a late stage ) the ability to slightly discriminate directional brightness was achieved by using the angle at which the light hit certain cells to identify the source the pit deepened over time , the opening diminished in size , and the number of photoreceptor cells increased , forming an effective pinhole camera that was capable of dimly distinguishing shapes the thin overgrowth of transparent cells over the eye 's aperture , originally formed to prevent damage to the eyespot , allowed the segregated contents of the eye chamber to specialise into a transparent humour that optimised colour filtering , blocked harmful radiation , improved the eye 's refractive index , and allowed functionality outside of water the transparent protective cells eventually split into two layers , with circulatory fluid in between that allowed wider viewing angles and greater imaging resolution , and the thickness of the transparent layer gradually increased , in most species with the transparent crystallin protein for instance , the distribution of photoreceptors tends to match the area in which the highest acuity is required , with horizon-scanning organisms , such as those that live on the african plains , having a horizontal line of high-density ganglia , while tree-dwelling creatures which require good all-round vision tend to have a symmetrical distribution of ganglia , with acuity decreasing outwards from the centre optical superposition eyes are constrained to a spherical shape , but other forms of compound eyes may deform to a shape where more ommatidia are aligned to , say , the horizon , without altering the size or density of individual ommatidia their eyes are almost divided into two , with the upper region thought to be involved in detecting the silhouettes of potential prey—or predators—against the faint light of the sky above eyes can be the most visible parts of organisms , and this can act as a pressure on organisms to have more transparent eyes at the cost of function eyes may be mounted on stalks to provide better all-round vision , by lifting them above an organism 's carapace ; this also allows them to track predators or prey without moving the head physically these can not be reduced in size to achieve the acuity seen with single lensed eyes as in mammals this is a rather small section of the electromagnetic spectrum , probably reflecting the submarine evolution of the organ : water blocks out all but two small windows of the em spectrum , and there has been no evolutionary pressure among land animals to broaden this range many organisms are unable to discriminate between colours , seeing instead in shades of grey ; colour vision necessitates a range of pigment cells which are primarily sensitive to smaller ranges of the spectrum the alternative , developed by organisms that had lost these oil droplets in the course of evolution , is to make the lens impervious to uv light—this precludes the possibility of any uv light being detected , as it does not even reach the retina in humans , there are three types of cones , maximally sensitive to long-wavelength , medium-wavelength , and short-wavelength light ( often referred to as red , green , and blue , respectively , though the sensitivity peaks are not actually at these colours ) the colour seen is the combined effect of stimuli to , and responses from , these three types of cone cells the pigment molecules used in the eye are various , but can be used to define the evolutionary distance between different groups , and can also be an aid in determining which are closely related—although problems of convergence do exist c-opsins are also found in some derived bilaterian-invertebrate eyes , such as the pallial eyes of the bivalve molluscs ; however , the lateral eyes ( which were presumably the ancestral type for this group , if eyes evolved once there ) always use r-opsins
