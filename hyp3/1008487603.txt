( ii ) in your enjoyment , or use , of my product i would have the direct enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work , that is , of having objectified man 's essential nature , and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another man 's essential nature the psychic value of a human consists in being able to conceive ( think ) of the ends of their actions as purposeful ideas , which are distinct from the actions required to realize a given idea in the course of history , to ensure individual survival societies have organized themselves into groups who have different , basic relationships to the means of production one societal group ( class ) owned and controlled the means of production while another societal class worked the means of production and in the relations of production of that status quo the goal of the owner-class was to economically benefit as much as possible from the labour of the working class in the course of economic development when a new type of economy displaced an old type of economy—agrarian feudalism superseded by mercantilism , in turn superseded by the industrial revolution—the rearranged economic order of the social classes favored the social class who controlled the technology ( the means of production ) that made possible the change in the relations of production despite the ideological promise of industrialization—that the mechanization of industrial production would raise the mass of the workers from a brutish life of subsistence existence to honorable work—the division of labour inherent to the capitalist mode of production thwarted the human nature ( gattungswesen ) of the worker and so rendered each individual into a mechanistic part of an industrialized system of production , from being a person capable of defining their value through direct , purposeful activity moreover , the near-total mechanization and automation of the industrial production system would allow the ( newly ) dominant bourgeois capitalist social class to exploit the working class to the degree that the value obtained from their labour would diminish the ability of the worker to materially survive in the resultant communist society , the fundamental relation of the workers to the means of production would be equal and non-conflictual because there would be no artificial distinctions about the value of a worker 's labour ; the worker 's humanity ( gattungswesen ) thus respected , men and women would not become alienated hence , each worker could direct their labour to productive work suitable to their own innate abilities , rather than be forced into a narrowly defined , wage slavery '' job '' meant to extract maximal profit from individual labour as determined by and dictated under the capitalist mode of production in the classless , collectively-managed communist society , the exchange of value between the objectified productive labour of one worker and the consumption benefit derived from that production will not be determined by or directed to the narrow interests of a bourgeois capitalist class , but instead will be directed to meet the needs of each producer and consumer although production will be differentiated by the degree of each worker 's abilities , the purpose of the communist system of industrial production will be determined by the collective requirements of society , not by the profit-oriented demands of a capitalist social class who live at the expense of the greater society under the collective ownership of the means of production , the relation of each worker to the mode of production will be identical and will assume the character that corresponds to the universal interests of the communist society capitalism reduces the labour of the worker to a commercial commodity that can be traded in the competitive labour-market , rather than as a constructive socio-economic activity that is part of the collective common effort performed for personal survival and the betterment of society therefore , alienation is a lack of self-worth , the absence of meaning in one 's life , consequent to being coerced to lead a life without opportunity for self-fulfillment , without the opportunity to become actualized , to become one 's self in part i : '' feuerbach – opposition of the materialist and idealist outlook '' of the german ideology ( 1846 ) , karl marx said the following : things have now come to such a pass that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces , not only to achieve self-activity , but also , merely , to safeguard their very existence that humans psychologically require the life activities that lead to their self-actualisation as persons remains a consideration of secondary historical relevance because the capitalist mode of production eventually will exploit and impoverish the proletariat until compelling them to social revolution for survival in the marxist-humanist theory of state-capitalism ( 1992 ) , raya dunayevskaya discusses and describes the existence of the desire for self-activity and self-actualisation among wage-labour workers struggling to achieve the elementary goals of material life in a capitalist economy
