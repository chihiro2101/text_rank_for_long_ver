in the first chapter , sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book , especially to his account for bad faith and freedom as bad faith , sartre describes one 's self-deception about the human reality , one must believe that their social role is equivalent to their human existence living a life defined by one 's occupation , social , racial , or economic class , is the very essence of '' bad faith '' , the condition in which people can not transcend their situations in order to realize what they must be ( human ) and what they are not ( waiter , grocer , etc it is also essential for an existent to understand that negation allows the self to enter what sartre calls the '' great human stream '' the great human stream arises from a singular realization that nothingness is a state of mind in which we can become anything , in reference to our situation , that we desire the difference between existence and identity projection remains at the heart of human subjects who are swept up by their own condition , their '' bad faith '' sartre argues that such an attitude is partially correct since it is based in the '' irreducible character of human reality '' , but that it would be fully correct only if the homosexual accepted that he is a homosexual in the sense that he has adopted a pattern of conduct defined as that of a homosexual , although not one '' to the extent that human reality can not be finally defined by patterns of conduct '' sartre consistently mentions that in order to get out of bad faith , one must realize that one 's existence and one 's formal projection of a self are distinctly separate and within the means of human control nothingness , in terms of bad faith , is characterized by sartre as the internal negation which separates pure existence and identity , and thus we are subject to playing our lives out in a similar manner however , sartre takes a stance against characterizing bad faith in terms of '' mere social positions '' says sartre , '' i am never any one of my attitudes , any one of my actions additionally , an important tenet of bad faith is that we must enact a bit of '' good faith '' in order to take advantage of our role to reach an authentic existence being a '' moral person '' requires one to deny authentic impulses ( everything that makes us human ) and allow the will of another person to change one 's actions being '' a moral person '' is one of the most severe forms of bad faith sartre states that many relationships are created by people 's attraction not to another person , but rather how that person makes them feel about themselves by how they look at them this system is often mistakenly called '' love '' , but it is , in fact , nothing more than emotional alienation and denial of freedom through conflict with the other sartre believes that it is often created as a means of making the unbearable anguish of a person 's relationship to their '' facticity '' ( all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited , such as birthplace and time ) bearable sartre contends that human existence is a conundrum whereby each of us exists , for as long as we live , within an overall condition of nothingness ( no thing-ness ) —that ultimately allows for free consciousness however , sartre contends our conscious choices ( leading to often unconscious actions ) run counter to our intellectual freedom this leads to failed dreams of completion , as sartre described them , because inevitably we are unable to bridge the void between the purity and spontaneity of thought and all-too constraining action ; between the being and the nothingness that inherently coincide in our self this is accomplished by rigorously forcing order onto nothingness , employing the '' spirit ( or consciousness of mind ) of seriousness '' and describing the failure to do so in terms such as '' bad faith '' and '' false consciousness '' though sartre 's conclusion seems to be that being diminishes before nothingness since consciousness is probably based more on spontaneity than on stable seriousness , he contends that any person of a serious nature is obliged to continuous struggle between two things : : a ) the conscious desire for peaceful self-fulfillment through physical actions and social roles—as if living within a portrait that one actively paints of oneself : b ) the more pure and raging spontaneity of no thing consciousness , of being instantaneously free to overturn one 's roles , pull up stakes , and strike out on new paths in sartre 's opinion , consciousness does not make sense by itself : it arises only as an awareness of objects consciousness is therefore always and essentially consciousness of something , whether this '' something '' is a thing , a person , an imaginary object , etc sartre 's contribution , then , is that in addition to always being consciousness of something , consciousness is always consciousness of itself , one 's '' ego '' ) , but rather that , as a phenomenon in the world , consciousness both appears and appears to itself at the same time by appearing to itself , sartre argues that consciousness is fully transparent ; unlike an ordinary '' object '' ( a house , for instance , of which it is impossible to perceive all of the sides at the same time ) , consciousness '' sees '' all aspects of itself at once according to sartre , in his clinical work , freud encountered patients who seemed to embody a particular kind of paradox—they appeared to both know and not know the same thing sartre thinks that the postulation of a censor within the psychic economy is therefore redundant : at the level of the censor , we still encounter the same problem of a consciousness that hides something from itself for sartre , what freud identifies as repression is rather indicative of the larger structure of bad faith psychoanalysis thus does not yield any special insight , since hiding something from oneself occurs at the level of consciousness as a unified phenomenon , not as part of some intra-psychic mechanism the for-itself brings nothingness into the world and therefore can stand out from being and form attitudes towards other beings by seeing what it is not being-for-others ( être-pour-autrui ) : here a new dimension arises in which the self exists as an object for others marcel considered sartre 's analysis of bad faith '' one of the most outstanding and solid '' parts of being and nothingness , writing that it prevented sartre 's arguments from being purely abstract marcel saw one of the most important merits of the work to be to show '' that a form of metaphysics which denies or refuses grace inevitably ends by setting up in front of us the image of an atrophied and contradictory world where the better part of ourselves is finally unable to recognise itself in his view , sartre failed to '' deal with the problem of truth in a radical and existential way '' , instead viewing truth in '' the ordinary intellectualistic sense that has been traditional with non-existential philosophers '' and thereby remaining a cartesian rationalist she identified them as part of a french tradition of serious thought about problems of fundamental importance
