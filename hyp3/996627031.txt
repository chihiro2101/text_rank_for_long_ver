hilbert 's statement is sometimes misunderstood , because by the '' arithmetical axioms '' he did not mean a system equivalent to peano arithmetic , but a stronger system with a second-order completeness axiom the system hilbert asked for a completeness proof of is more like second-order arithmetic than first-order peano arithmetic as a nowadays common interpretation , a positive solution to hilbert 's second question would in particular provide a proof that peano arithmetic is consistent there are many known proofs that peano arithmetic is consistent that can be carried out in strong systems such as zermelo–fraenkel set theory these do not provide a resolution to hilbert 's second question , however , because someone who doubts the consistency of peano arithmetic is unlikely to accept the axioms of set theory ( which is much stronger ) to prove its consistency gödel 's second incompleteness theorem shows that it is not possible for any proof that peano arithmetic is consistent to be carried out within peano arithmetic itself this theorem shows that if the only acceptable proof procedures are those that can be formalized within arithmetic then hilbert 's call for a consistency proof can not be answered however , as nagel and newman ( 1958:96 & ndash ; 99 ) explain , there is still room for a proof that can not be formalized in arithmetic : : '' this imposing result of godel 's analysis should not be misunderstood : it does not exclude a meta-mathematical proof of the consistency of arithmetic but these meta-mathematical proofs can not be represented within the arithmetical calculus ; and , since they are not finitistic , they do not achieve the proclaimed objectives of hilbert 's original program the possibility of constructing a finitistic absolute proof of consistency for arithmetic is not excluded by gödel ’ s results the method used in this proof can also be used to prove a cut elimination result for peano arithmetic in a stronger logic than first-order logic , but the consistency proof itself can be carried out in ordinary first-order logic using the axioms of primitive recursive arithmetic and a transfinite induction principle in this program , formal theories of arithmetic or set theory are assigned ordinal numbers that measure the consistency strength of the theories a theory will be unable to prove the consistency of another theory with a higher proof theoretic ordinal while the theorems of gödel and gentzen are now well understood by the mathematical logic community , no consensus has formed on whether ( or in what way ) these theorems answer hilbert 's second problem kreisel ( 1976 ) states that although gödel 's results imply that no finitistic syntactic consistency proof can be obtained , semantic ( in particular , second-order ) arguments can be used to give convincing consistency proofs
