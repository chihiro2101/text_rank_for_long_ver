rabbits would be kept in a group in these pits or courts , and individuals collected when desired for eating or pelts these rabbits were largely 'common ' or 'meat ' rabbits and not of a particular breed , although regional strains and types did arise in addition to being harvested for meat , properly prepared rabbit pelts were also an economic factor with the rise of scientific animal breeding in the late 1700s , led by robert bakewell ( among others ) , distinct livestock breeds were developed for specific purposes this led to a short-lived '' boom '' in rabbit breeding , selling , and speculation , when a quality breeding animal could bring 75 to 200 image : farmrabbits.jpg thumb right meat-type rabbits were raised for supplementary food in the great depression of the 1930s. 350px science played another role in rabbit raising , this time with rabbits themselves as the tools used for scientific advancement this eventually resulted in the development of various recipes for pellet feed this may have been , in part , because rabbits require less physical space than dogs or cats , and do not require a specialized habitat like goldfish outside of the exhibition circles , rabbit raising remained a small-scale but persistent household and farm endeavor , in many locations unregulated by the rules that governed the production of larger livestock eventually , farmers across europe and in the united states began to approach cuniculture with the same scientific principles as had already been applied to the production of grains , poultry , and hoofed livestock the animals are particularly useful in areas where women are limited in employment outside the household , because rabbits can be kept successfully in small areas the use of animals , including rabbits , in animal testing has been subject to increased scrutiny in developed countries increasing regulation has raised the cost of producing animals for this purpose , and made other experimental options more attractive meanwhile , various rescue groups under the house rabbit society umbrella have taken an increasingly strident stance against any breeding of rabbits ( even as food in developing countries ) on the grounds that it contributes to the number of mistreated , unwanted or abandoned animals the variety of applications , as well as the versatile utility of the species , appears sufficient to keep rabbit raising a going concern in one aspect or another around the planet rabbits have been raised for meat production in a variety of settings around the world for the smaller enterprise , multiple local rabbit breeds may be easier to use or other heritage type breeds may be used only in a specific geographic area sub-par or '' cull '' animals from other breeding goals ( laboratory , exhibition , show , wool , or pet ) may also be used for meat , particularly in smallholder operations counterintuitively , the giant rabbit breeds are rarely used for meat production , due to their extended growth rates ( which lead to high feed costs ) and their large bone size ( which reduces the percentage of their weight that is usable meat ) in contrast to the multitude of breeds and types used in smaller operations , breeds such as the new zealand and the californian , along with hybrids of these breeds , are most frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries specific lines of commercial breeds have been developed that maximize these qualities – rabbits may be slaughtered as early as seven weeks and does of these strains routinely raise litters of 8 to 12 kits other breeds of rabbit developed for commercial meat production include the florida white and the altex rabbit breeding stock raised in france is particularly popular with meat rabbit farmers internationally , some being purchased as far away as china in order to improve the local rabbit herd prior to the development of modern balanced rabbit rations , rabbit breeding was limited by the nutrition available to the doe advances in nutrition , such as those published by the usda rabbit research station , resulted in greater health for breeding animals and the survival of young stock likewise , offering superior , balanced nutrition to growing kits allowed for better health and less illness among slaughter animals current practices include the option of re-breeding the doe within a few days of delivery ( closely matching the behavior of wild rabbits during the spring and early summer , when forage availability is at its peak a doe of ideal meat-stock genetics can produce five times her body weight in fryers a year determination of health effects of breeding schedules is made more difficult by the domestic rabbit 's reproductive physiology – in contrast to several other mammal species , rabbits are more likely to develop uterine cancer when not used for breeding than when bred frequently in europe , however , a sizable market remains for the dark fryers that come from older and larger rabbits a number of rabbit breeds have been developed with the fur trade in mind rabbit fur is widely used throughout the world in 1972 , around 450,000 rabbits were used for experiments in the united states , decreasing to around 240,000 in 2006 rabbit cultivation intersects with research in two ways : first , the keeping and raising of animals for testing of scientific principles some experiments require the keeping of several generations of animals treated with a particular drug , in order to fully appreciate the side effects of that drug there is also the matter of breeding and raising animals for experiments the new zealand white is one of the most commonly used breeds for research and testing the use of rabbits for the draize test , which is used for , amongst other things , testing cosmetics on animals , has been cited as an example of cruelty in animal research modern methods for housing domestic rabbits vary from region to region around the globe and by type of rabbit , technological or financial opportunities and constraints , intended use , number of animals kept , and the particular preferences of the owner or farmer various goals include maximizing number of animals per land unit ( especially common in areas with high land values or small living areas ) minimizing labor , reducing cost , increasing survival and health of animals , and meeting specific market requirements ( such as for clean wool , or rabbits raised on pasture ) various industries also have commonly accepted practices which produce predictable results for that type of rabbit product extensive cuniculture refers to the practice of keeping rabbits at a lower density and a lower production level than intensive culture the most extensive rabbit '' keeping '' methods would be the harvest of wild or feral rabbits for meat or fur market , such as occurred in australia prior to the 1990s warren-based cuniculture is somewhat more controlled , as the animals are generally kept to a specific area and a limited amount of supplemental feeding provided finally , various methods of raising rabbits with pasture as the primary food source have been developed pasturing rabbits within a fence ( but not a cage ) , also known as colony husbandry , has not been commonly pursued due to the high death rate from weather and predators more commonly ( but still rare in terms of absolute numbers of rabbits and practitioners ) is the practice of confining the rabbits to a moveable cage with an open or slatted floor so that the rabbits can access grass but still be kept at hand and protected from weather and predators this method of growing rabbits does not typically result in an overall reduction for the need for supplemented feed the growing period to market weight is much longer for grass fed rather than pellet fed animals , and many producers continue to offer small amounts of complete rations over the course of the growing period hutches or cages for this type of husbandry are generally made of a combination of wood and metal wire , made portable enough for a person to move the rabbits daily to fresh ground , and of a size to hold a litter of 6 to 12 rabbits at the market weight of may be part of large-scale operations , while individual rabbits in smaller setups may receive better & mdash ; or worse & mdash ; care today , the belgian hare is considered one of the rarest breeds , with less than 200 in the united states as reported in a recent survey
