although the church held considerable real estate , estimated at approximately 60,000 in equity by historian larry t the credit needs of the church , growing population and ongoing land transactions required a local bank banks in the united states in the period before the civil war issued and often backed their own currency after some discussion by the leadership of the church , church apostle orson hyde went to the ohio legislature to request a bank charter while oliver cowdery went to philadelphia and acquired plates to print notes for the proposed kirtland safety society bank hyde returned to the ohio legislature in february with a petition , joined by several non-mormons , for a bank based on far less capital stock under the advice of non-mormon legal counsel , the kirtland safety society anti-banking company ( kssabc ) was formed under revised articles on january 2 , 1837 as a joint stock company to serve as a quasi-banking institution the proposed capitalization of the '' anti-bank '' greatly exceeded the resources that were available from its backers , as noted by historian , robert kent fielding : as it was projected , there was never the slightest chance that the kirtland safety society anti-bank-ing company could succeed the kss failure , although unique in some ways , was part of a national bank crisis known as the panic of 1837 that began in may of that year underlying causes of the nationwide financial panic included speculative and inflationary selling of public lands in western states like michigan , ohio and missouri the economic policies of the previous president andrew jackson , including the specie circular and the withdrawal of government funds from the second bank of the united states , also contributed to the crisis within two months the failures in new york alone aggregated nearly 100,000,000 in value '' out of eight hundred and fifty banks in the united states , three hundred and forty-three closed entirely , sixty-two failed partially , and the system of state banks received a shock from which it never fully recovered kssabc continued issuing notes through june , but eventually failed due to insolvency , as most of the kssabc reserves were tied up in land rather than silver as some erroneously believed williams assumed management of the kssabc until the institution closed its doors in november with about 100,000 in unresolved debt according to lds church scholars , '' four of these suits were settled ; three were voluntarily discontinued by the plaintiffs ; and ten resulted in judgments against joseph smith and others '' the church also raised and put up 38,000 in bail money for smith at the geauga county court which was to be held to satisfy any judgment that might be rendered against smith they arrived about one month later , spent about two weeks in missouri on church business and returned to kirtland on december 10 in may 1837 , disgruntled church members ( including church leaders ) and non-members alike began to publicly blame smith for their losses shortly after his resignation from the kssabc in july he stated in the august 1837 messenger and advocate : i am disposed to say a word relative to the bills of the kirtland safety society bank shortly before his resignation , smith also took out a 1,225 loan from a separate bank to help keep kssabc solvent kimball later said that the bank 's failure was so shattering that afterwards '' there were not twenty persons on earth that would declare that joseph smith was a prophet of god woodruff records that smith had an alleged revelation on the topic , but declined to share it , saying only that '' if we would give heed to the commandments the lord had given this morning all would be well some church leaders encouraged people to hold onto these notes as they said that someday they would have value again a kirtland safety society note bearing joseph smith 's signature can be quite valuable ; for example , in an auction in march 2006 , a 100 note sold for 11,500 ( about a 3 % per year gain )
