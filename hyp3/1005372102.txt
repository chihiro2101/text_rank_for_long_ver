in many armies , the first role has been assumed by independent battalions , battlegroups , task forces , brigades and other , similarly sized operational units the royal australian regiment includes all of the australian army 's regular infantry ( other than reserve and special forces units ) , and the artillery units of the british army are known collectively as the royal regiment of artillery , which is sub-divided for operation purposes into field regiments when at full strength , an infantry regiment normally comprised two field battalions of about 800 men each or 8â€“10 companies prior to world war i , an infantry regiment in the french , german , russian , and other smaller armies would comprise four battalions , each with a full strength on mobilization of about 1,000 men as far as possible , the separate battalions would be garrisoned in the same military district , so that the regiment could be mobilized and campaign as a 4,000 strong linked group of sub-units a notable exception to this practice was the british line infantry system where the two regular battalions constituting a regiment alternated between '' home '' and '' foreign '' service and seldom came together as a single unit depending upon the country , regiments can be either combat units or administrative units or both in the continental system , the division is the functional army unit , and its commander is the administrator of every aspect of the formation : his staff train and administer the soldiers , officers , and commanders of the division 's subordinate units generally , divisions are garrisoned together and share the same installations : thus , in divisional administration , a battalion commanding officer is just another officer in a chain of command in other cases , new regiments were raised for new functions within an army ; e.g within the regimental system , soldiers , and usually officers , are always posted to a tactical unit of their own regiment whenever posted to field duty in the british army and armies modeled on it ( such as the australian , the new zealand , the canadian , the pakistani and the indian ) , the term regiment is used confusingly in two different ways : it can mean an administrative identity and grouping , or a tactical unit as an example , the punjab regiment of the indian army has expanded from four battalions in 1956 to its present strength of 20 , while , in pakistan , several regiments have over 50 battalions in canada , the regiment is a formation of one or more units ; existing almost exclusively for reasons of heritage , the continuance of battle honors and esprit de corps the three regular force infantry regiments each consist of three regular force battalions of approximately 600 soldiers , in addition to one or more reserve battalions while individual battalions may have different roles ( for example different battalions of the frontier force regiment may be mechanized infantry , paratroop infantry , or mountain troops ) , the regiment is considered to encompass all of them in the british army , for most purposes , the regiment is the largest '' permanent '' organisational unit these claims are contested on various points of precedence ; see faq : regiments , in general and especially : faq : oldest regiment in the british army in the united kingdom , there existed until recently a number of administrative '' divisions '' in the infantry that encompassed several regiments , such as the guards division , the former scottish division ( now a single regiment ) , or the light division ( now also compressed into a multi-battalion single regiment ) the reduction and consolidation of british infantry regiments that began in the late 1950s and concluded in 2006 has resulted in a system of administrative regiments each with several battalions , a band , a common badge and uniform etc it should , however , be noted that amalgamations beginning in the late 1950s and ending in 2006 have diluted the british regimental system through the now almost universal adoption of '' large regiments '' for the infantry of the army as of 2014 , only thirteen line infantry regiments survive , each comprising up to six of the former battalions that previously had separate regimental status armoured regiments in canada since the end of the world war ii have usually consisted of a single tactical regiment one administrative armoured regiment of the british army consisted of more than one tactical regiment all of a nation 's artillery units are considered part of a single administrative regiment , but there are typically several tactical artillery regiments until after the world war ii , every regiment had at least two battalions thus in the armoured corps , the traditional administrative '' regiment '' tends to play more of a ceremonial role , while in practice , its members are administered by their corps or '' branch '' as in the artillery from colonial times , the regiment consisted of a small regimental headquarters ( regimental headquarters company not existing before 1915 ) and in 1775 ten '' line '' companies , based on the british army model , without any permanent intermediate level of organization , viz during the civil war , there were nine new united states regular army infantry regiments ( 11th though the 19th ) added to the ten already existing army lineage series , infantry part 1 : regular army occasionally , a regimental commander would organize several companies into one , or rarely two , temporary organizations , called battalions , under command of the regiment 's lieutenant colonel , major , or a senior captain ( for example : 101 officers and enlisted men per company , and a 36-member regimental headquarters , with 1,046 per typical union army infantry regiment in 1861 , vs ) after the short war the army reduced the size of companies , battalions , and regiments by about 30 % under demobilization ) the division also contained an artillery brigade of three regiments and three separate combat service support regiments : engineer , quartermaster , and medical the infantry regiments still contained three battalions ; there were now '' headquarters and headquarters '' companies ( hhcs ) not only at the regimental-level but in each battalion as well in 1942 the army began organizing armored divisions into combat commands , which grouped armor , armored infantry , and armored field artillery battalions into three tactical groups within the division without regard to regimental affiliation under this plan , battalions were eliminated and the infantry battle groups consisted of an hhc , five rifle companies , and a combat support company by 1965 , the army had completely eliminated the regiment ( replaced by the brigade ) under the reorganization objective army divisions ( road ) plan as a tactical and administrative organization in all combat arms , save for a few armored cavalry regiments however the battalion was restored as a tactical echelon , now organized into an hhc , three rifle companies , and a combat support company by 2015 , the only army unit still organized as a traditional regiment was the 75th ranger regiment beginning with the first world war , as units became increasingly larger , and weapon systems and equipment became more complex , the regiment , while still filling a role as the immediate headquarters for its organic battalions , began to be replaced by the brigade as the intermediate tactical and operational headquarters for battalions , with the division becoming the senior administrative and logistical headquarters for the battalions , regiments , and brigades under its command cars uses the army 's traditional regiments as parent organizations for historical purposes , but the primary building blocks are divisions , brigades , and battalions in some brigades several numbered battalions carrying the same regimental association may still serve together , and tend to consider themselves part of the traditional regiment when in fact they are independent battalions serving a brigade , rather than a regimental , headquarters the united states army regimental system ( usars ) was established in 1981 to replace the combat arms regimental system , to provide each soldier with continuous identification with a single regiment , and to support that concept with a personnel system that would increase a soldier 's probability of serving recurring assignments with his or her regiment most often these formations took the form of provisional battalions , but on occasion would become provisional regiments , provisional brigades , or rarely ( especially when combined with navy personnel ) naval infantry brigades army 2nd division , the corps began organizing larger standing forces in world war ii , the marine corps organized its regiments and divisions under the '' triangular division '' model developed by the army in 1939 each of these two types of regiments contain a headquarters company and varying numbers and types of logistics battalions and separate logistics companies , depending upon whether the regiment 's primary mission is to provide direct support to ( 1 ) a regimental combat team ( rct ) or a marine amphibious unit ( meu ) , or ( 2 ) provide general support across the marine expeditionary force ( mef ) , including intermediate ground logistics support to marine aviation units the motorised rifle regiment was one of the basic tactical units within the soviet armed forces , totaling around 2,500 officers and other ranks by the late 1980s , it consisted of a regimental headquarters in command of three motorised rifle battalions , each numbering around five hundred personnel and equipped with either bmp infantry fighting vehicles or btr armoured personnel carriers , and one tank battalion , typically consisting of thirty-one t-64 , t-72 or t-80 tanks , although older models were present in units outside the european theater ( warfare ) by the late 1980s , tank regiments operating as part of motorised rifle divisions contained slightly over 1,100 officers and other ranks while those operating within tank divisions contained over 1,600 the artillery regiment was used to provide fire support , but differed depending on whether it was part of a motorised rifle division or tank division numbering a little over five hundred personnel total , the sam regiment consisted of a regimental headquarters in charge of twenty sa-6 gainfuls organised into five missile firing batteries ; most were sa-6a platforms although since 1979 a limited number of sa-6bs were also deployed and some regiments used the sa-8 gecko as an alternative the irish army field artillery units are called regiments air defence units are organised as a single regiment with individual batteries stationed around the country like the scout rangers , members of the special forces regiment of the philippine army are also highly trained in counter-insurgency operations it traces its origins back to the year 2000 when non-commissioned officers from the scout rangers and 1st special forces regiment ( airborne ) were trained by american military advisers from the 1st battalion , 1st special forces group
