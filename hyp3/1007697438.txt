at the time of the ship 's completion in 1916 , the new york times remarked that the new warship was '' the greatest battleship afloat '' because she was so much larger than other contemporary american battleships : its tonnage was nearly three times that of the obsolete 1890 pre-dreadnought , almost twice that of the 1904 battleship , and almost greater than that of one of the first american dreadnoughts , —built just seven years prior to nevada nevada was the first battleship in the us navy to have triple gun turrets , a single funnel , and an oil-fired steam power plant one of the main purposes of the great white fleet , which sailed around the world in 1907–1908 , was to prove to japan that the us navy could '' carry any naval conflict into japanese home waters '' possibly as a result of this , battleships after 1908 were mainly designed to '' steam 8,000 & nbsp ; miles at cruising speeds '' ; given the distance between san pedro , where the fleet would be based , and manila , where the fleet was expected to have to fight under war plan orange , was , endurance was obviously a major concern for the u.s an additional seven standard type battleships and the six of the were never completed due to the washington naval treaty the contract went to fore river shipbuilding company on 22 january 1912 for a total of 5,895,000 ( not including the armor and armament ) , and the time of construction was originally to be 36 months a secondary contract was signed on 31 july 1912 for 50,000 to cover the additional cost of a geared cruising unit on each propeller shaft ; this also extended the planned construction time by five months these began on 4 november 1915 , when the ship conducted a twelve-hour endurance run '' up and down the new england coast '' , reaching a top speed of though her '' acceptance trials '' were interrupted on 5 november because of a gale and rough seas , they were continued on the 6th with a test of her fuel economy ; this consisted of a 24-hour run where nevada steamed at the us entered the war in april 1917 , but nevada was not sent to the other side of the atlantic because of a shortage of fuel oil in britain instead , four coal-fired battleships of battleship division 9 ( batdiv 9 ) , , , and departed the us to join the british grand fleet on 25 november 1917 long , left the us for britain , becoming the last american ship to join the fleet overseas for the rest of the war , the three ships operated from the bay , escorting the large and valuable convoys bound for the british isles to ensure no german heavy surface ships could slip past the british grand fleet and annihilate the merchant ships and their weak escorts of older cruisers this demonstrated to those allies and japan that the us navy had the ability to conduct transpacific operations and meet the imperial japanese navy in their home waters , where both japanese and war plan orange expected the '' decisive battle '' to be fought , if it should come nevada then served in the pacific fleet for the next eleven years as of 6 december 1941 , a saturday , all of the pacific fleet 's battleships were in port for the weekend for the first time since 4 july normally they took turns spending time in port , six would be out with vice admiral william s pye 's battleship task force one one weekend , while the next weekend would find three ranging with vice admiral william halsey , jr however , because halsey could not afford to take the slow battleships with his fast carriers on his dash to reinforce wake island 's marine detachment with fighters and because it was pye 's turn to rest in port and the harbor was where it was considered safe , none of the battleships were sailing on that morning when the sun rose over nevada on the 7th , the ship 's band was playing '' morning colors '' ; but planes then appeared on the horizon and the attack on pearl harbor began aft of arizona during the attack , nevada was not moored alongside another battleship off ford island , and therefore was able to maneuver , unlike the other seven battleships present her damage control crew corrected the list by counter-flooding and nevada got underway at 0840 , her gunners already having shot down four planes as bomb damage became evident , nevada was ordered to proceed to the west side of ford island to prevent her from sinking in deeper water instead , she was grounded off hospital point at 10:30 , with the help of and , though she managed to force down three more planes before she struck the shore the ship suffered a minimum of six bomb hits and one torpedo hit , but '' it is possible that as many as ten bomb hits may have been received , kingman , the overhaul was completed in october 1942 , and it changed the old battleship 's appearance so she slightly resembled a south dakota from a distance kitts commanding , then sailed for alaska , where she provided fire support from 11–18 may 1943 for the capture of attu old battleships such as nevada were attached to many convoys across the atlantic to guard against the chance that a german capital ship might head out to sea on a raiding mission during the invasion , nevada supported forces ashore from 6–17 june , and again on 25 june ; during this time , she employed her guns against shore defenses on the cherbourg peninsula , '' seeming to lean back as she hurled salvo after salvo at the shore batteries to support this , many ships were sent from the beaches of normandy to the mediterranean , including five battleships ( the united states ' nevada , , , the british , and the free french , three us heavy cruisers , and , and many destroyers and landing craft were transferred south nevada supported this operation from 15 august to 25 september 1944 , '' dueling '' with '' big willie '' : a heavily reinforced fortress with four 340 mm ( 13.4 in ) guns in two twin turrets beginning on 19 august , and continuing on subsequent days , one or more heavy warships bombarded it in conjunction with low-level bomber strikes however , after the fire support ships retired for the night , dawn '' came up like thunder '' when seven kamikazes attacked the force while it was without air cover one plane , though hit repeatedly by antiaircraft fire from the force , crashed onto the main deck of nevada , next to turret no another two men were lost to fire from a shore battery on 5 april until 30 june , she was stationed off okinawa ; she then departed to join the 3rd fleet from 10 july to 7 august , which allowed nevada to come within range of the japanese home islands during the closing days of the war , though she did not bombard them after she was thoroughly examined , and two other vessels used nevada as a practice gunnery target 65 miles southwest of pearl harbor on 31 july 1948 file : uss nevada ( bb-36 ) operation crossroads target ship.jpg battleship uss nevada ( bb-36 ) painted in orange as target ship for the operation crossroads able nuclear weapons test file : crossroads able atomic bomb test target ship disposition plan , 13 may 1946 ( 80-g-702624 )
