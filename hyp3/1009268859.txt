lovell , the story of jodrell bank the site was first used for astrophysics in 1945 , when bernard lovell used some equipment left over from world war ii , including a gun laying radar , to investigate cosmic rays over the next few years , lovell accumulated more ex-military radio hardware , including a portable cabin , known as a '' park royal '' in the military ( see park royal vehicles ) at the time , it was the world 's largest radio telescope image : lovell telescope 1.jpg thumb upright the lovell telescope the '' mark i '' telescope , now known as the lovell telescope , was the world 's largest steerable dish radio telescope , in diameter , when it was constructed in 1957 ; it is now the third largest , after the green bank telescope in west virginia and the effelsberg telescope in germany 29 the telescope became operational in mid-1957 , in time for the launch of the soviet union 's sputnik 1 , the world 's first artificial satellite 262 in the following years , the telescope tracked various space probes 272 in february 1966 , jodrell bank was asked by the soviet union to track its unmanned moon lander luna 9 and recorded on its fax transmission of photographs from the moon 's surface satellite and space probe observations were shared with the us department of defense satellite tracking research and development activity at project space track tracking space probes only took a fraction of the lovell telescope 's observing time and the remainder used for scientific observations including using radar to measure the distance to the moon and to venus ; lovell , out of the zenith , pp image : jodrell bank mark ii.jpg thumb the mark ii radio telescope the mark ii is an elliptical radio telescope , with a major axis and a minor axis of as well as operating as a standalone telescope , it has been used as an interferometer with the lovell telescope , and is now primarily used as part of the merlin project thumb the mark iv , v and va telescope proposals were put forward in the 1960s through to the 1980s to build even larger radio telescopes the mark iv proposal was for a diameter standalone telescope , built as a national project the mark va was similar to the mark v but with a smaller dish of and a design using prestressed concrete , similar to the mark ii ( the previous two designs more closely resembled the lovell telescope ) lovell , jodrell bank telescopes none of the proposed telescopes was constructed , although design studies were carried out and scale models were made , partly because of the changing political climate , partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the uk and it became necessary to upgrade the lovell telescope to the mark ia , which overran in terms of cost the array consists of up to seven radio telescopes and includes the lovell telescope , the mark ii , cambridge , defford , knockin , darnhall , and pickmere ( previously known as tabley ) jodrell bank has been involved with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) since the late 1960s ; the lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968 , with other telescopes at algonquin and penticton in canada 67–68 the lovell telescope and the mark ii telescopes are regularly used for vlbi with telescopes across europe ( the european vlbi network ) , giving a resolution of around 0.001 arcseconds in april 2011 , jodrell bank was named as the location of the control centre for the planned square kilometre array , or ska project office ( spo ) the ska is planned by a collaboration of 20 countries and when completed , is intended to be the most powerful radio telescope ever built in april 2015 it was announced that jodrell bank would be the permanent home of the ska headquarters for the period of operation expected for the telescope ( over 50 years ) in may 2017 jodrell bank entered into a partnership with the breakthrough listen initiative and will share information with jodrell bank 's team , who wish to conduct an independent seti search via its 76-m radio telescope and e-merlin array in october 2010 , work on a new visitor centre started and the jodrell bank discovery centre opened on 11 april 2011 it does not , however , include a planetarium , though a small inflatable planetarium dome has been in use on the site in recent years a path around the lovell telescope is approximately 20 & nbsp ; m from the telescope 's outer railway , information boards explain how the telescope works and the research that is done with it at jodrell bank , as part of the spacedout project , is the sun in a 1:15,000,000 scale model of the solar system covering britain in july 2011 the visitor centre and observatory hosted '' jodrell bank live '' – a rock concert with bands including the flaming lips , british sea power , wave machines , ok go and alice gold during the interval the 'screen ' was used to show a history of lovell 's work and jodrell bank the project , which aimed to replace the microwave links between jodrell bank and a number of other radio telescopes with high-bandwidth fibre-optic cables , greatly increasing the sensitivity of observations , was seen as critical to the survival of the facility it was intended to be a filming location for logopolis ( tom baker 's final doctor who serial ) but budget restrictions prevented this and another location with a superimposed model of a radio telescope was used instead since 13 july 1988 the lovell telescope has been designated as a grade i listed building on 10 july 2017 the mark ii telescope was also designated at the same grade on the same date five other buildings on the site were designated at grade ii ; namely the searchlight telescope , the control building , the park royal building , the electrical workshop , and the link hut
