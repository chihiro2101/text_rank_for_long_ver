both tim and chris had worked in arcade game development including , according to one report , konami 's gyruss , and claimed to be '' the most experienced arcade video game design team in britain '' until tiring of working for others and leaving to start ashby computers and graphics this led to acg 's initial trade being in creating arcade conversion kits , before moving into the home computer software market developing games under the ultimate play the game name it was a huge commercial success ; the spectrum version alone sold more than 300,000 copies to a market of only one million spectrum owners at the time , rollings , andrew both games were very well received by the gaming press , crash magazine in particular praising what ultimate had managed to do with the extra memory lunar jetman used this coincided with the introduction of the distinctive ultimate '' big box '' packaging ( used with all further spectrum releases until gunfright , and with various releases on other platforms ) , which the company felt might also help justify the price increase and encourage gamers to buy the game rather than copy it knight lore was something of a revolution in the home computer game market , using a forced-perspective isometric viewpoint branded filmation , the style of which would be extensively copied in other games , notable examples being batman and head over heels from ocean software with the consistent success of ultimate 's releases there were rumours of a buyout by ocean , until it was announced in 1985 that the stamper brothers had sold the ultimate catalogue and name to us gold , who would continue to release games under the ultimate label later titles such as martianoids and bubbler were not seen by the gaming press as being up to ultimate 's previously high standards and sales fell shortly before the us gold buyout , the name of another company '' rare limited '' began appearing on the credits of ultimate releases on 8 december 2006 and 16 january 2007 respectively , rare 's owners microsoft corporation filed us and eu trademark claims on the ultimate play the game name and logo the eu trademark may be found here : emulated versions of seven ultimate titles were later included as part of the 2015 game compilation rare replay for xbox one the magazines were not able to preview the games ; the review copies , usually sent out just before general release , would be the first opportunity for anyone to see them when a journalist reviewing nightshade for crash magazine asked ultimate what the object of the game was , and how large the play area was , they responded with , respectively , '' oh , we ca n't tell you that '' and '' it 's pretty large '' there have even been suggestions that ultimate themselves may have created the screen shot to generate more interest in the game ultimate were one of the first developers to have their own fanbase focused on the company and brand as much as the games themselves whereas most games of the time would list those responsible on the cassette inlay cards or even on the front of the box ( one notable example , football manager , even going as far as to feature a picture of author kevin toms on the front of the box ) , no ultimate title ever mentioned any names at all , and the authorship of some of them remains unclear tim also created the cover art for the games , including the famous ultimate play the game logo this remains a possibility as although chris stamper has said in an interview , '' what was the last one we developed as a team ? it was gunfright , i think '' , ultimate had already admitted to developing games in an order different from that of their release , as with knight lore and sabre wulf in an interview with the brothers in retro gamer magazine , they revealed they also authored outlaws , in just six weeks , so ultimate would have something for the commodore 64 for christmas
