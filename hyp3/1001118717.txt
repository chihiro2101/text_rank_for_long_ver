while classical economics was at a loss to explain the vicious business cycles , london had many societies that proposed alternatives first described by mummery and hobson in the book physiology of industry ( 1889 ) , underconsumption was a scathing criticism of say 's law and classical economics ' emphasis on thrift during the very late 19th century , his works included problems of poverty ( 1891 ) , evolution of modern capitalism ( 1894 ) , problem of the unemployed ( 1896 ) and john ruskin : social reformer ( 1898 ) during his coverage of the second boer war , hobson began to form the idea that imperialism was the direct result of the expanding forces of modern capitalism his publications during the next few years demonstrated an exploration of the associations between imperialism and international conflict these works included war in south africa ( 1900 ) and psychology of jingoism ( 1901 ) hobson wrote for several other journals before writing his next major work , the industrial system ( 1909 ) his advocacy for the formation of a world political body to prevent wars can be found in his piece towards international government ( 1914 ) this was soon followed by writings for socialist publications such as the new leader , the socialist review and the new statesman lenin , in imperialism , the highest stage of capitalism ( 1916 ) —which was probably his most influential work on later marxian scholarship—made use of hobson 's imperialism extensively , remarking in the preface '' i made use of the principal english work , imperialism , j '' in the work itself—despite disagreeing with hobson 's liberal politics—lenin repeatedly cites hobson 's interpretation of imperialism approvingly ; for example : we see that kautsky , while claiming that he continues to advocate marxism , as a matter of fact takes a step backward compared with the social-liberal hobson , who more correctly takes into account two “ historically concrete ” gann argue that hobson had an enormous influence in the early 20th century among people all around the world : hobson 's ideas were not entirely original ; however his hatred of moneyed men and monopolies , his loathing of secret compacts and public bluster , fused all existing indictments of imperialism into one coherent system.his ideas influenced german nationalist opponents of the british empire as well as french anglophobes and marxists ; they colored the thoughts of american liberals and isolationist critics of colonialism notably , john gallagher and ronald robinson in their 1953 article the imperialism of free trade argued that hobson placed too much emphasis on the role of formal empire and directly ruled colonial possessions , not taking into account the significance of trading power , political influence and informal imperialism they also argued that the difference in british foreign policy that hobson observed between the mid-19th-century indifference to empire that accompanied free market economics , and the later intense imperialism after 1870 , was not real hobson believed '' colonial primitive peoples '' were inferior , writing in imperialism he advocated their '' gradual elimination '' by an international organization : '' a rational stirpiculture in the wide social interest might , however , require a repression of the spread of degenerate or unprogressive races '' imperialism and the anti-imperialist mind , 1989 , transaction publishers , lewis samuel feuer , page 150 theories of imperialism ( routledge revivals ) : war , conquest and capital , 1984 , norman etherington , routledge , page 73 while it can be said the 1902 work reflected the social darwinism trend of the time , hobson left this section mainly unchanged when he published the third edition in 1938 marks , page 10 , quote : '' and in england , the social democratic federation newspaper justice state that '' the jew financier '' was the '' personification of international capitalism '' - an opinion repeated in the anti-semitic diatribes of john a hobson , the socialist writer who wrote one of the earliest english books with '' capitalism '' in the title and helped to familiarize britons with the concept '' in the 1890s he argued that large scale jewish immigration from the russian partition to western europe harmed the interests of native workers and advocated limitations on immigration according to history professor norman etherington , the section on financiers in imperialism seems irrelevant to hobson 's economic discourse , and was probably included since hobson truly believed it theories of imperialism ( routledge revivals ) : war , conquest and capital , routledge , 1984 , norman etherington , page 70 hobson was innovative in tying between 1898 and 1902 the concept of modernity , empire , and jews together ; according to hobson , the international financiers influenced the government partially through jewish press ownership in south africa and london hobson 's analysis was widely disseminated by those opposed to the war and received significant attention other contemporary anti-war writers also alleged a mainly jewish '' capitalist conspiracy '' was taking place hostages of modernization : germany - great britain - france , de gruyter , chapter by colin holmes , 1993 , pages 326-328 following hobson 's january 1900 article capitalism and imperialism in south africa , labour leader keir hardie in february 1900 repeated the same message in paraphrased form accusing '' half a dozen financial houses , many of them jewish '' of leading the uk to war '' the british left and the '' jewish conspiracy '' : a case study of modern antisemitism however , as the british working class tended to support the war in south africa , hobson 's zeal in attacking '' jew power '' in south africa and manipulation by a secret '' racial confederacy '' failed to attract popular support in the uk , though '' anti-alien '' sentiments did continue to be an issue allett , john '' new liberalism : the political economy of j
