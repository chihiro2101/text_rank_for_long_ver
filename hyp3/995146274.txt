speculation includes immaturity of the central nervous system at younger ages , making the brain more vulnerable to the effects of fever the increased activity of neurons during rapid brain development , may help explain why children , particularly younger than age 3 , are prone to febrile seizures , with occurrences decreasing after age 5 other proposed mechanisms include the interactions of inflammation , particularly cytokines , which are released during a fever , causing elevated temperatures in the brain , which may somehow lead to a seizure ; and performing a physical exam that looks for signs of infection including meningitis and neurological status however , lumbar puncture is an option that may be considered in children younger than 12 months of age since signs and symptoms of meningitis may be atypical , if the child does not return to baseline , or if the child lacks immunization against haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal or vaccination status is unknown there is no evidence to support administering fever reducing medications such as acetaminophen at the time of a febrile seizure or to prevent the rate of recurrence this is especially urgent if the child shows symptoms of stiff neck , extreme lethargy , or abundant vomiting , which may be signs of meningitis , an infection over the brain surface questions that may be asked of the caregivers who witnessed the seizure include , length of seizure , timing of day , loss of consciousness , loss of bowel or urinary continence , a period of altered level of consciousness of confusion once the seizure stopped , movement of the eyes to a specific side , recent infections , recent medication usage including antibiotics or fever reducer medications , family history of febrile and afebrile seizures , vaccination and travel history children with febrile convulsions are more likely to have a febrile seizure in the future if they were young at their first seizure ( less than 18 months old ) , have a family history of a febrile convulsions in first-degree relatives ( a parent or sibling ) , have a short time between the onset of fever and the seizure , had a low degree of fever before their seizure , or have a seizure history of abnormal neurological signs or developmental delay similarly , the prognosis after a complex febrile seizure is excellent , although an increased risk of death has been shown for complex febrile seizures , partly related to underlying conditions
