in 1955 , starting '' the man from nowhere '' trilogy , which took dan and his companions outside the solar system for the first time in the late fifties eagles new owners objected to the cost of the studio and the complexity of the stories production fell to frank bellamy , whose modern three-dimensional style contrasted with hampson 's , despite efforts to smooth the transition by alternating the two pages of the weekly strip between bellamy and the team of don harley and keith watson , and freelance artist bruce cornwell dan dare was surrounded by a varying cast , initially : dan dare ( full name colonel daniel mcgregor dare ) was chief pilot of the interplanet space fleet his uniform looked like a typical british army type ( frank hampson used his own world war ii army uniform as a model ) , though a lighter green he was fiercely loyal and the only character apart from dan to appear in every story he became governor of northern venus when the planet was placed under un rule at

tone of the strip ( heavily influenced by the punk movement , as was much of 2000 ad ) and the personality of the title character dare was now launched on a deep space mission , much in the style of star trek but with technology designs very much influenced by star wars this story arc concluded with the pair escaping the earth authorities and going on the run to try to clear their names by tracking down the mekon and recovering the crystal , establishing the format for the next story arc one strip was entitled '' the return of dan dare '' , which also featured the return of the mekon
