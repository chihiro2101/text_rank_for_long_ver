thumb peripheral membrane proteins may interact with other proteins or directly with the lipid bilayer the phospholipid bilayer that forms the cell surface membrane consists of a hydrophobic inner core region sandwiched between two regions of hydrophilicity , one at the inner surface and one at the outer surface of the cell membrane ( see lipid bilayer article for a more detailed structural description of the cell membrane ) the inner and outer surfaces , or interfacial regions , of model phospholipid bilayers have been shown to have a thickness of around 8 to 10 Ã¥ , although this may be wider in biological membranes that include large amounts of gangliosides or lipopolysaccharides these proteins are usually described as peripheral as one of their conformational states is water-soluble or only loosely associated with a membrane the association of a protein with a lipid bilayer may involve significant changes within tertiary structure of a protein these may include the folding of regions of protein structure that were previously unfolded typical amphitropic proteins must interact strongly with the lipid bilayer in order to perform their biological functions it has been shown that the membrane binding affinities of many peripheral proteins depend on the specific lipid composition of the membrane with which they are associated amphitropic proteins associate with lipid bilayers via various hydrophobic anchor structures hydrophobic interactions have been shown to be important even for highly cationic peptides and proteins , such as the polybasic domain of the marcks protein or histactophilin , when their natural hydrophobic anchors are present protein association with membranes through the use of acylated residues is a reversible process , as the acyl chain can be buried in a protein 's hydrophobic binding pocket after dissociation from the membrane thumb some cytosolic proteins are recruited to different cellular membranes by recognizing certain types of lipid found within a given membrane binding of a protein to a specific lipid occurs via specific membrane-targeting structural domains that occur within the protein and have specific binding pockets for the lipid head groups of the lipids to which they bind however , not all peripheral peptides and proteins are cationic , and only certain sides of membrane are negatively charged
