where a large volume of hot gas is available from some process , a heat recovery steam generator or recovery boiler can use the heat to produce steam , with little or no extra fuel consumed ; such a configuration is common in a combined cycle power plant where a gas turbine and a steam boiler are used in all cases the combustion product waste gases are separate from the working fluid of the steam cycle , making these systems examples of external combustion engines however , ferritic stainless steel is often used in superheater sections that will not be exposed to boiler water , and electrically-heated stainless steel shell boilers are allowed under the european '' pressure equipment directive '' for production of steam for sterilizers and disinfectors cast iron may be used for the heating vessel of domestic water heaters although such heaters are usually termed '' boilers '' in some countries , their purpose is usually to produce hot water , not steam , and so they run at low pressure and try to avoid boiling nuclear fission is also used as a heat source for generating steam , either directly ( bwr ) or , in most cases , in specialised heat exchangers called '' steam generators '' ( pwr ) heat recovery steam generators ( hrsgs ) use the heat rejected from other processes such as gas turbine the furnace can be situated at one end of a fire-tube which lengthens the path of the hot gases , thus augmenting the heating surface which can be further increased by making the gases reverse direction through a second parallel tube or a bundle of multiple tubes ( two-pass or return flue boiler ) ; alternatively the gases may be taken along the sides and then beneath the boiler through flues ( 3-pass boiler ) in case of a locomotive-type boiler , a boiler barrel extends from the firebox and the hot gases pass through a bundle of fire tubes inside the barrel which greatly increases the heating surface compared to a single tube and further improves heat transfer rightwater-tube boiler : in this type , tubes filled with water are arranged inside a furnace in a number of possible configurations often the water tubes connect large drums , the lower ones containing water and the upper ones steam and water ; in other cases , such as a mono-tube boiler , water is circulated by a pump through a succession of coils water tube boilers can be designed to exploit any heat source and are generally preferred in high-pressure applications since the high-pressure water/steam is contained within small diameter pipes which can withstand the pressure with a thinner wall because of this , steam is an efficient method of moving energy and heat around a site from a central boiler house to where it is needed , but without the right boiler feedwater treatment , a steam-raising plant will suffer from scale formation and corrosion if feed water is then sent into the empty boiler , the small cascade of incoming water instantly boils on contact with the superheated metal shell and leads to a violent explosion that can not be controlled even by safety steam valves draining of the boiler can also happen if a leak occurs in the steam supply lines that is larger than the make-up water supply could replace the water entrained in the steam may damage turbine blades or in the case of a steam engine , may cause serious mechanical damage due to hydrostatic lock also , higher steam pressure will be possible than with saturated steam , enabling the steam to carry more energy although superheating adds more energy to the steam in the form of heat there is no effect on pressure , which is determined by the rate at which steam is drawn from the boiler and the pressure settings of the safety valves through either method , the extreme heat in the flue gas path will also heat the superheater steam piping and the steam within the pump used to charge the boiler must be able to overcome the boiler 's operating pressure , else water will not flow as a superheated boiler is usually operated at high pressure , the corresponding feedwater pressure must be even higher , demanding a more robust pump design right supercritical steam generators are frequently used for the production of electric power there is no generation of steam bubbles within the water , because the pressure is above the critical pressure point at which steam bubbles can form boilers generally have 2 or 3 pressuretrols : a manual-reset pressuretrol , which functions as a safety by setting the upper limit of steam pressure , the operating pressuretrol , which controls when the boiler fires to maintain pressure , and for boilers equipped with a modulating burner , a modulating pressuretrol which controls the amount of fire as the name implies , this valve is usually located directly on the bottom of the boiler , and is occasionally opened to use the pressure in the boiler to push these particulates out trycock : a type of valve that is often use to manually check a liquid level in a tank automatic blowdown/continuous heat recovery system : this system allows the boiler to blowdown only when makeup water is flowing to the boiler , thereby transferring the maximum amount of heat possible from the blowdown to the makeup water low-water cutoff : it is a mechanical means ( usually a float switch ) or an electrode with a safety switch that is used to turn off the burner or shut off fuel to the boiler to prevent it from running once the water goes below a certain point desuperheater tubes or bundles : a series of tubes or bundles of tubes in the water drum or the steam drum designed to cool superheated steam , in order to supply auxiliary equipment that does not need , or may be damaged by , dry steam early boilers provided this stream of air , or draught , through the natural action of convection in a chimney connected to the exhaust of the combustion chamber types of draught can also be divided into induced draught , where exhaust gases are pulled out of the boiler ; forced draught , where fresh air is pushed into the boiler ; and balanced draught , where both effects are employed mechanical forced draught is provided by means of a fan forcing air into the combustion chamber
