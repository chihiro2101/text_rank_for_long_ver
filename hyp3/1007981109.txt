the leaves are scale-like 1–10 & nbsp ; mm long , except young seedlings in their first year , which have needle-like leaves the female cones start out similarly inconspicuous , but grow to about 1–2 & nbsp ; cm long at maturity when 6–8 months old ; they have 6-12 overlapping , thin , leathery scales , each scale bearing 1–2 small seeds with a pair of narrow lateral wings the five species in the genus thuja are small to large evergreen trees with flattened branchlets seed cones ellipsoid , typically 9-14mm long , they mature and open the first year another very distinct and only distantly related species , formerly treated as thuja orientalis , is now treated in a genus of its own , as platycladus the closest relatives of thuja are thujopsis , distinct in its thicker foliage and stouter cones , and tetraclinis articulata ( ancient greek or , formerly classed in the genus and after which thuja is named ) , distinct in its quadrangular foliage ( not flattened ) and cones with four thick , woody scales the genus thuja , like many other forms of conifers , is represented by ancestral forms in cretaceous rocks of northern europe , and with the advance of time is found to migrate from northerly to more southerly regions , until during pliocene time it disappeared from europe pruning on 'emerald green ’ thuja arborvitae ‘ emerald green ’ arborvitae faqs is rarely needed due to their growth rate and shape the five extant species are : species formerly placed in thuja include : austrocedrus chilensis ( d.don ) pic.serm ) and many more the extant species thuja sutchuenensis was believed to be extinct until 1999 , when a small population was discovered in southeast china the foliage is also readily eaten by deer , and where deer population density is high , can adversely affect the growth of young trees and the establishment of seedlings the genus thuja has current populations in both north america and east asia within the genus the taxonomy is in flux , but most recent research based on molecular analysis of plastomes in the genus thuja showed evidence for a new grouping , with two sister clades : t thuja plicata is an important tree to the first nations people of the pacific northwest and is sometimes called '' canoe tree '' because of its use as a material for native american canoes cedarwood oil and cedar leaf oil , which are derived from thuja occidentalis , have different properties and uses the natives of canada used the scaled leaves of thuja occidentalis ( eastern white cedar ) to make a tea that has been shown to contain 50 & nbsp ; mg of vitamin c per 100 & nbsp ; grams ; this helped prevent and treat scurvy
