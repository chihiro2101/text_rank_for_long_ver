psycholinguists study how people acquire and use language , according to the following main areas : language acquisition : how do children acquire language ? language comprehension : how do people comprehend language ? language production : how do people produce language ? second language acquisition : how do people who already know one language acquire another one ? a researcher interested in language comprehension may study word recognition during reading , to examine the processes involved in the extraction of orthography , morphological , phonological , and semantic information from patterns in printed text a researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level ( this concerns connotation , and possibly can be examined through the conceptual framework concerned with the semantic differential ) psycholinguistics further divide their studies according to the different components that make up human language after the diminished popularity of the behaviorism model , ethology reemerged as a leading train of thought within psychology , allowing the subject of language , an innate behavior , to be examined once more within the scope of psychology pronko 's desire was to unify myriad related theoretical approaches under a single name though there is still much debate , there are two primary theories on childhood language acquisition : the behaviorism perspective , whereby all language must be learned by the child ; and the innatist perspective , which believes that the abstract system of language can not be learned , but that humans possess an innate language faculty or an access to what has been called '' universal grammar '' when chomsky asserted that children acquiring a language have a vast search space to explore among all possible human grammars , there was no evidence that children received poverty of the stimulus all the rules of their language according to the '' innateness hypothesis '' , such a language faculty is what defines human language and makes that faculty different from even the most sophisticated forms of animal communication the view in favor of chomsky still holds that the human ability to use language ( specifically the ability to use recursion ) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability these models provide evidence that there may be sufficient information contained in the input to learn language , even syntax if this is true , then an innate mechanism is no longer necessary to explain language acquisition some see this system as '' structured cooperation between language-users '' who use conceptual and semantic deference in order to exchange meaning and knowledge , as well as give meaning to language , thereby examining and describing '' semantic processes bound by a 'stopping ' constraint which are not cases of ordinary deferring these theories are typically concerned with the types of information , contained in the sentence , that the reader can use to build meaning , and at what point in reading does that information becomes available to the reader for example , one influential theory of sentence processing , the '' garden-path theory '' , states that syntactic analysis takes place first in contrast to the modular view , an interactive theory of sentence processing , such as a constraint-based lexical approach assumes that all available information contained within a sentence can be processed at any time one of the most effective ways to explain the way people represent meanings using rule-governed languages is by observing and analyzing instances of speech errors , which include speech disfluencies like false starts , repetition , reformulation and constant pauses in between words or sentences , as well as slips of the tongue , like-blendings , substitutions , exchanges ( e.g these speech errors have significant implications for understanding how language is produced , in that they reflect that : speech is planned in advance : speech errors such as substitution and exchanges show that one does not plan their entire sentence before they speak morphologically complex words are assembled : errors involving blending within a word reflect that there seems to be a rule governing the construction of words in production ( and also likely in mental lexicon ) it is useful to differentiate between three separate phases of language production : conceptualization : '' determining what to say '' ; formulation : '' translating the intention to say something into linguistic form '' ; execution : '' the detailed articulatory planning and articulation itself '' such experiments often take advantage of priming effects , whereby a '' priming '' word or phrase appearing in the experiment can speed up the lexical decision for a related '' target '' word later ( 1995 ) used a visual-world paradigm to study the cognitive processes related to spoken language assuming that eye movements are closely linked to the current focus of attention , language processing can be studied by monitoring eye movements while a subject is listening to spoken language the analysis of systematic speech error , as well as the writing and typing of language , can provide evidence of the process that has generated it another unanswered question in psycholinguistics is whether the human ability to use syntax originates from innate mental structures or social interaction , and whether or not some animals can be taught the syntax of human language thus , critical period may exist during which language can be learned readily
