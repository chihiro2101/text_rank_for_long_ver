archaeological findings show people settled in the middle alpine region , later to be called tyrol , when the glaciers retreated and flora and fauna revived , after the last ice age ended around 12,000 bc the northern part of tyrol came under the influence of the bavarii , while the west probably was part of alamannia thus , tyrol was divided among three spheres of influence that met in the approximate area of today 's bolzano since the bishops were nominated directly by the emperor and their office was not hereditary , putting the area under their control was intended to secure it to the emperors later counts would hold much of their territory directly from the holy roman emperor at the end of count meinhard ii 's rule ( 1259–1295 ) the '' county and reign of tyrol '' had established itself firmly in the '' land on the adige and inn '' , as the region was then called the acquisition of tyrol was strategically important to the habsburg dynasty , since it allowed it to connect their austrian territories with their territorial possessions in the area of today 's switzerland from that time , tyrol was ruled by various lines of the habsburg family , who bore the title count tyrol repeatedly became involved in the political and military conflicts of the habsburgs with milan , venice , switzerland and the county of görz , as well as bavaria and swabia the battle of sempach in 1386 , in which duke leopold iii of austria was defeated by the old swiss confederacy had important repercussions on tyrol , and was the first of a series of military conflicts between the county and its neighbours the 1405-1408 war against the swiss appenzeller , 1413 the conflict with venice and 1410 the invasion of the lower inn valley by the bavarians in 1423 , during the rule of frederick iv '' empty pockets '' , the first meeting that could be called a tyrolean parliament met ( innsbruck : alpina printers and publishers ) p.2 during frederick iv 's tenure internal conflicts between the powerful local aristocracy and the duke arose , which eventually led to the decline of the nobles and of their traditional system of values , and strengthened the duke 's rule over the country this enabled sigismund '' rich in coin '' to continue his father 's rule to the end of the 15th century and lead the county into the modern era when in 1808 a new constitution for the kingdom of bavaria was introduced , tyrol was integrated into south bavaria , and divided into three districts , losing its special status in the kingdom this , together with the economic decline under bavarian rule , and the kingdom 's religious reforms which were opposed by the catholic population , led to a growing conflict between the tyrolean population and the bavarian authorities one day later a military unit of 8000 men consisting of bavarian and french troops approached innsbruck from the brenner pass , but was convinced to surrender by captain teimer , who dressed up as a major of the regular austrian army and made the bavarian officers believe that the austrian army was approaching innsbruck , when in fact it was still about 40 miles away point iv of the agreement stated that austria was to withdraw its troops from the territories of vorarlberg and tyrol , returning them to bavarian rule tyrol remained divided under bavarian and italian authority for another four years , before its reunification and return to austria following the decisions at the congress of vienna in 1814 integrated into the austrian empire , from 1867 onwards , it was a kronland ( crown land ) of cisleithania , the western half of austria-hungary thumb on the eve of world war i , the southern part of the austrian crown land of tyrol was populated mainly by italian speakers ( the so-called welschtirol , or trentino ) the existence of areas largely populated by italian-speaking populations under the rule of the austrian empire was a constant cause of friction between austria and italy , a national state set on the unification of all italians italy 's fear that it would not get what it wanted in the event of a victorious triple alliance caused it to remain neutral during the first year of the war , and the preoccupation that it would n't get what it wanted from a victorious entente either if it remained neutral led it to join the war on the side of the latter italy conducted intense negotiations with austria , which was prepared to part with trentino in exchange of italy 's neutrality , but italy wanted ( among other things ) to reach the alpine water divide , which it claimed as its 'natural border ' , a demand which austria refused , since it would have meant giving up a territory regarded as personal fief by the habsburg emperors on 26 april 1915 , italy signed the treaty of london , agreeing to declare war against the central powers in exchange for the unredeemed territories of trentino , gorizia , trieste and dalmatia , as well as the part of german tyrol south of the main alpine divide war against the austro-hungarian empire was declared may 24 , 1915 the ensuing front became known as the '' war in ice and snow '' , as troops occupied the highest mountains and glaciers all year long on may 15 , 1916 , the austrian army battle of asiago , unaided by the german army , whose command had advised against such a move this inconclusive attack weakened the eastern front , which enabled the russian army to overrun austrian positions in galicia and threaten the heart of the habsburg empire rothenberg 1977 , p on 30 october 1918 , the
