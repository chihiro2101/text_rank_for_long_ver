the first standard public telephone kiosk introduced by the united kingdom post office was produced in concrete in 1921 and was designated k1 ( kiosk no.1 ) as of 2020 , there are seven k1 boxes in existence , all of which have been listed at grade ii by historic england , with two still located on british streets the red telephone box was the result of a competition in 1924 to design a kiosk that would be acceptable to the london metropolitan boroughs which had hitherto resisted the post office 's effort to erect k1 kiosks on their streets the original wooden prototypes of the entries were later put into public service at under-cover sites around london that of scott 's design is the only one known to survive and is still where it was originally placed , in the left entrance arch to the royal academy the post office chose to make scott 's winning design in cast iron ( scott had suggested mild steel ) and to paint it red ( scott had suggested silver , with a '' greeny-blue '' interior ) and , with other minor changes of detail , it was brought into service as the kiosk no.2 or k2 k3 , introduced in 1929 , again by giles gilbert scott , was similar to k2 but was constructed from concrete and intended for nationwide use the k6 was the first red telephone kiosk to be extensively used outside london , and many thousands were deployed in virtually every town and city , replacing most of the existing kiosks and establishing thousands of new sites this slightly brighter red was introduced with the k8 model in 1968 , but went on to be used across the estate on previous models too the k1 and the later k3 concrete kiosks were produced at various ( and largely unrecorded ) locations , around the country although many kiosks have been fitted with replacement backs over recent years , unmodified examples generally have the identity of their manufacturer marked on a plate on the outside at the bottom of their back panel a supplementary way of identifying the manufacturer is by means of casting marks on the various component parts – i.e up to around 1949 , the year of manufacture is also included the more recently erected non-bt k6 kiosks ( generally painted black ) are for the most part new castings , sourced from new manufacturers the design was initially the '' tudor crown '' , then in widespread use in government service however , in scotland , following pillar box war , the post office ( like other government agencies there ) began to use , from 1955 , a representation of the actual crown of scotland it was used primarily for new sites ; around 11000 were installed , replacing earlier models only when they needed relocating or had been damaged beyond repair the k8 featured a single large glass panel on two sides and the door with regards to create a new box with easier access , lower maintenance and brighter lighting , the post office introduced a prototype run of '' croydon '' telephone boxes from 1972 , named as such because they were erected in croydon in either the late 1970s or late 1980s , a new , smaller hooded booth was introduced known as booth 7a shortly afterwards , bt announced that only 90 of the 77,000 remaining traditional boxes had been painted different colours '' as an experiment '' and that no final decision had been reached many local authorities used legislation designed to protect buildings of architectural or historic importance to keep old telephone boxes in prominent locations and around 2,000 of them were given listed status in kingston upon thames a number of old k6 boxes have been used to form a work of art resembling a row of fallen dominoes as of january 2020 , it was estimated that 8,000 traditional red telephone boxes remain in public service little-used red telephone boxes can be adopted by parish councils in england for other uses during 2009 a k6 in the village of westbury-sub-mendip in somerset was converted into a library or book exchange replacing the services of the mobile library which no longer visits the village following a competition by a girl guide unit in 2011 to find a use for their local disused telephone box in glendaruel , argyll , it has been fitted with a defibrillator from october 2014 , several of london 's disused k6 telephone boxes have been painted green and converted to free mobile phone chargers named solarboxes image : jazzclub.jpg thumb upright imitation british-style box used as the entrance to a jazz club in havana , cuba several of these distinctive telephone boxes have been installed on the norman , oklahoma , campus of the university of oklahoma , where they continue to serve their originally intended function in addition , there is a red telephone box outside the town building ( town hall/police station/post office ) in the tiny mountain town of rowe , massachusetts , which is an original installation dating back to when the town of rowe first got telephone service an original k6 can also be found outside of the allied building in treasure island , florida australia and new zealand each had their own design of red telephone box , and some examples have been preserved in sensitive or historic sites red phone boxes can be seen in portugal – for example , they are a common sight in the city of porto there were several such municipal services in the uk , but whereas most had been brought under the post office monopoly by 1913 , hull 's , being very efficient , was allowed to remain under the control of hull corporation ( the city council ) as a result , although the corporation used k6 kiosks , they were painted cream and had the crown omitted from the design after public complaints at the loss of heritage it was agreed that approximately 125 of the boxes would be retained and they remain in use kc also allocated limited numbers ( approximately 1,000 ) for sale to the public and many were sold off even before they had been removed from service hull also continues to use k8 and kx 100 plus kiosks and in the past has used other non-gpo/bt designs a green telephone box exists in cregneash , as was the practice in many rural areas of britain it takes the form of a row of twelve k6 telephone boxes , the first one upright , the others gradually falling over like dominoes it was originally intended that the last upright box was to contain a working telephone the band continued the theme on the cover of their live dvd/cd live in london under the bridge by featuring a row of white telephone boxes modelled on the cream telephone boxes in kingston upon hull where two of the band are from jpg british red phone box alongside standard bell canada boxes at former kingston and pembroke railway station file : red telephone box.jpg red telephone box at bünde railway station , germany more k6 facts red telephone kiosks in oxford , england existing red phone boxes around the city of liverpool where i live : are there any k8 's out there ?
