it is therefore believed that the local letter sampi was used to denote some kind of intermediate sound during the phonetic change from the earlier plosive clusters towards the later sound , possibly an affricate , forming a triplet with the greek letters for and for this purpose , the 24 letters of the standard classical greek alphabet were used with the addition of three archaic or local letters : digamma/wau ( ϝ , /tsade ( ϻ , denoting an sound ) , was not used in this way from this , it has been concluded that the system must have been invented at a time and place when digamma and koppa were still either in use or at least still remembered as parts of the alphabetic sequence , whereas san had either already been forgotten , or at least was no longer remembered with its original alphabetic position in the latter case , according to a much debated view , sampi itself may in fact have been regarded as being san , but with a new position in the alphabet an early , though isolated , instance of apparent use of alphabetic milesian numerals in athens occurs on a stone inscribed with several columns of two-digit numerals , of unknown meaning , dated from the middle of the 5th century bc while the emergence of the system as a whole has thus been given a much earlier dating than was often assumed earlier , actual occurrences of the letter sampi in this context have as yet not been found in any early examples earlier than the attestations in the full function as a numeral are a few instances where sampi was used in athens as a mark to enumerate sequences of things in a set , along with the 24 other letters of the alphabet , without implying a specific decimal numeral value for instance , there is a set of 25 metal tokens , each stamped with one of the letters from alpha to sampi , which are dated to the 4th century bc and were probably used as identification marks for judges in the courts of the athenian democracy at an early stage in the papyri , the numeral sampi was used not only for 900 , but , somewhat confusingly , also as a multiplicator for 1000 , since a way of marking thousands and their multiples was not yet otherwise provided by the alphabetic system in early stone inscriptions , the shape of sampi , both alphabetic and numeric , is , galen says that one of them '' looks like the way some people write the sign for 900 '' , and describes this as '' the shape of the letter π with a vertical line in the middle '' ( '' '' ) throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , many authors have assumed that sampi was essentially a historical continuation of the archaic letter san , the m-shaped alternative of sigma ( σ ) that formed part of the greek alphabet when it was originally adopted from phoenician the second reason for the assumption is the systematicity in the development of the letter inventory : there were three archaic letters that dropped out of use in alphabetic writing ( digamma , koppa , and san ) , and three extra-alphabetic letters were adopted for the milesian numeral system , two of them obviously identical with the archaic digamma and koppa ; hence , it is easy to assume that the third in the set had the same history objections to this account have been related to the fact that sampi did not assume the same position san had had , and to the lack of any obvious relation between the shapes of the two letters and the lack of any intermediate forms linking the two uses scaliger 's discussion also contains the first known attestation of the name '' san pi '' ( sampi ) in the western literature , and the first attempt at explaining it
