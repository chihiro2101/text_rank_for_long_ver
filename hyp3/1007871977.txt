upon montcalm 's arrival in montreal , he was immediately apprised of the situation along the border with british north america montcalm 's assemblage of troops at fort carillon distracted the attention of the british , and upon receiving positive reports from scouts , vaudreuil and montcalm decided to make an approach and try to take the fort montcalm 's first victory in north america came relatively quickly and easily , and signified to the british that the french now had a capable general heading their army under the terms of the surrender , the garrison was to be escorted back to fort edward , where they would be barred from serving against the french for 18 months , and all british prisoners were to be returned to the french , who also kept all the stores and ammunition montcalm decided not to advance on to fort edward despite the demoralization of the british forces and the proximity of the fort , claiming the road was too bad for his heavy guns and that the garrison would be reinforced before they arrived on july 5 , the british began to set upon the fort , but the killing of the british second-in-command held them up long enough for canadian reinforcements to arrive and bring montcalm 's total force to over 3600 despite the relative insecurity of this particular fort and the overwhelming number of enemy troops , the french were able to hold the garrison due a series of costly errors by the british general abercrombie the battle was a major success for the french and a major setback for the british , and greatly added to the reputation of montcalm , who boasted of his victory and often exaggerated his claims in writings back to france while disparaging the efforts of the canadian and native fighters in the second half of 1758 , the british began to take the upper hand in north america , due on one part to the massive resources they organized against the french and on the other part to the lack of reinforcements and supplies from france to support its colony , which was already on the brink of starvation following a catastrophic harvest this news , along with the threat of impending attack by the british , crushed montcalm 's spirit , who had lost all hope of holding the city in case of a siege before montcalm could react , wolfe 's forces had already reached the plains outside the city , and were ready for battle in a decision largely considered to be montcalm 's greatest mistake , the general decided to attack the british with what forces he had rather than wait for the forces garrisoned along the shore to come and bolster his numbers in a letter addressed to general wolfe , who unbeknownst to him had also fallen in battle , montcalm attempted to surrender the city , despite the fact he did not hold the authority to do so the culture of the french metropolitan officer led montcalm and others like him to see the seven years ' war in terms of a defence of their own and their kingdom 's honour , regardless of what it meant for new france conversely , the culture of the canadian colonial officer led vaudreuil and others like him to interpret the war in terms of a defence of the territorial integrity of new france and thus its very existence ' '' montcalm quoted in waging the war that way would ensure the preservation and extension of french military honour , which was of particular importance to the king and his government after the loss of fort beaus√©jour at the outset of the war
