'' moss 2004:33 the terms birding and birdwatching are today used by some interchangeably , although some participants prefer birding , partly because it includes the auditory aspects of enjoying birds whereas these dedicated birders may often travel specifically in search of birds , birdwatchers have been described by some enthusiasts as having a more limited scope , perhaps not venturing far from their own yards or local parks to view birds indeed , in 1969 a birding glossary appeared in birding magazine which gave the following definitions : twitching is a british term used to mean '' the pursuit of a previously located rare bird '' in north america it is more often called chasing a rare bird that stays long enough for people to see it is twitchable or chaseable many birders maintain a life list , that is , a list of all of the species they have seen in their life , usually with details about the sighting such as date and location moss 2004:10 the study of birds and natural history in general became increasingly prevalent in britain during the victorian era , often associated with collection , eggs and later skins being the artifacts of interest it was only in the late 19th century that the call for bird protection began leading to the rising popularity of observations on living birds moss 2004:88 in north america , the identification of birds , once thought possible only by shooting was made possible by the emergence of optics and field identification guides the rising popularity of the car increased the mobility of birdwatchers and this made new locations accessible to those interested in birds the bto saw the potential to produce scientific results through the networks , unlike the royal society for the protection of birds ( rspb ) which like the audubon society originated from the bird protection movement moss 2004:234–235 travelling far away also led to problems in name usage , british birds like '' wheatear '' , '' heron '' and '' swallow '' needed adjectives to differentiate them in places where there were several related species moss 2004:250 the falling cost of air-travel made flying to remote birding destinations a possibility for a large number of people towards the 1980s the need for global guides to birds became more relevant and one of the biggest projects that began was the handbook of the birds of the world which started in the 1990s with josep del hoyo , a country doctor in catalonia , jordi sargatal , and ornithologist andy elliott binoculars , an essential piece of birding equipment , became more easily available after world war ii , making the hobby of birding more widely accessible the practice of travelling long distances to see rare bird species was aided by the rising popularity of cars moss 2004:265 about 4 % of north americans were interested in birding in the 1970s and in the mid-1980s at least 11 % were found to watch birds at least 20 days of the year fish and wildlife service study , birders contributed 36 billion to the us economy in 2006 , and one fifth ( 20 % ) of all americans are identified as birdwatchers guided bird tours have become a major business with at least 127 companies offering tours worldwide many birders occupy themselves with observing local species ( birding in their '' local patch '' ) , but may also make specific trips to observe birds in other locales the most active times of the year for birding in temperate zones are during the spring or fall migrations when the greatest variety of birds may be seen early mornings are typically better as the birds are more active and vocal making them easier to spot certain locations such as the local patch of forest , wetland and coast may be favoured according to the location and season these birdwatchers may also count all birds in a given area , as in the christmas bird count or follow carefully designed study protocols the cornell lab of ornithology hosts many citizen-science projects to track the number and distribution of bird species across north america the birding competitions encourage individuals or teams to accumulate large numbers of species within a specified time or area with special rules such events have been criticised , especially those claimed to aid conservation when they may actually mask serious environmental issues , or where competitive birding involves large amounts of driving competitive birdwatching events include : big day : teams have 24 hours to identify as many species as possible hides ( known as blinds in north america ) or observation towers are often used to conceal the observers from birds , and/or to improve viewing conditions in the early 1950s the only way of communicating new bird sightings was through the postal system and it was generally too late for the recipients to act on the information american birding association aba ethics the lack of definite evidence , except arguably in the form of photographs , makes birding records difficult to prove but birdwatchers strive to build trust in their identification there have been suggestions that identification of birds may be a form of gaining status which has been compared with kula ring noted in papua new guinean cultures a study of the motivations for birdwatching in new york concluded that initial motivations were largely similar in males and females , but males who participate actively in birding are more motivated by '' sharing knowledge '' with others , and active female birders are more motivated by their '' intellectual '' interest in studying birds , and by the '' challenge '' of identifying new and rare birds and improving their skills while the representation of women has always been low , moss 2004:316–330 it has been pointed out that nearly 90 % of all birdwatchers in the united states are white with only a few african americans many birdwatchers have spent their entire lives trying to see all the bird species of the world moss 2004:261 some birders have been known to go to great lengths and many have lost their lives in the process the 2011 film the big year depicted three birders competing in an american birding association area big year , and the 2019 film birders is a short documentary
