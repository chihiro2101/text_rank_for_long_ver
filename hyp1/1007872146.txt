the first sea-based missile deterrent forces were a small number of conventionally powered cruise missile submarines ( ssg ) and surface ships fielded by the united states and the soviet union in the 1950s , deploying the regulus missile and the soviet p-5 pyatyorka ( ss-n-3 shaddock ) , both land attack cruise missiles that could be submarine-launched cruise missile although these forces served until 1964 and ( on the soviet side ) were augmented by the nuclear-powered echo-class submarine ssgns , they were rapidly eclipsed by slbms carried by nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines ( ssbns ) beginning in 1960 imperial japanese navy s are considered the strategic predecessors to today ’ s ballistic submarines , especially to the regulus missile program begun about a decade after world war ii the first nation to field ballistic missile submarines ( ssb ) was the soviet union , whose first experimental ssb was a converted project 611 ( zulu iv class ) diesel-powered submarine equipped with a single ballistic missile launch tube in its sail five additional project v611 and av611 ( zulu v class ) submarines became the world 's first operational ssbs with two r-11fm missiles each , entering service in 1956–57 the initial r-13 ( ss-n-4 ) ballistic missiles could only be launched with the submarine on the surface and the missile raised to the top of the launch tube , but were followed by r-21 ( ss-n-5 ) missiles beginning in 1963 , which were launched with the submarine submerged the world 's first operational nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine ( ssbn ) was with 16 polaris a-1 missiles , which entered service in december 1959 and conducted the first ssbn deterrent patrol november 1960 – january 1961 with more missiles on one us ssbn than on five golf-class boats , the soviets rapidly fell behind in sea-based deterrent capability the first soviet ssbn with 16 missiles was the yankee-class submarine , the first of which entered service in 1967 , by which time the us had commissioned 41 ssbns , nicknamed the '' 41 for freedom '' thirty-one of the 41 original us ssbns were built with larger diameter launch tubes with future missiles in mind both the united states and the soviet union commissioned larger ssbns designed for new missiles in 1981 the american large ssbn was the , also called the '' trident submarine '' , with the largest ssbn armament ever of 24 missiles , initially trident i but built with much larger tubes for the ugm-133 trident ii , which entered service in 1990 when the commenced sea trials in 1980 , two us ssbns had their missiles removed to comply with salt treaty requirements ; the remaining eight were converted to attack submarines ( ssn ) by the end of 1982 these were all in the pacific , and the guam ssbn base was disestablished ; the first several ohio-class boats used new trident facilities at naval submarine base bangor , washington the russian ssbn force then stood at six delta ivs , three delta iiis , and a lone typhoon used as a testbed for new missiles ( the r-39s unique to the typhoons were reportedly scrapped in 2012 ) they serve as the third leg of the nuclear triad in countries that also operate nuclear-armed land based missiles and aircraft ballistic missile submarines are designed for stealth to avoid detection at all costs , and that makes nuclear power , allowing almost the entire patrol to be conducted submerged , very important in both cases , ssbn submarines operate on a two-crew concept , with two complete crews – including two captains – called gold and blue in the united states , starboard and port in the united kingdom people 's republic of china type 092 submarine – 1 in service type 094 submarine – 5 in service out of 8 planned royal navy – 4 in service united states – 14 in service ( 4 have been converted into cruise missile submarines )
