meanwhile , roark and cameron create inspired work , but struggle financially roark works briefly at another firm , then opens his own office but has trouble finding clients and closes it down rand 's stated goal in writing fiction was to portray her vision of an ideal man in the character of roark was at least partly inspired by american architect frank lloyd wright rand described the inspiration as limited to specific ideas he had about architecture and '' the pattern of his career '' she denied that wright had anything to do with the philosophy expressed by roark or the events of the plot in her inspiration for the character came from a neighbor she knew while working in hollywood in the early 1930s rand asked this young woman to explain her goals in life rand created keating as an archetype of this motivation , which she saw as the opposite of self-interest for most of the novel , the character operates from what rand viewed as wrong ideas in including hearst 's yellow journalism and mixed success in attempts to gain political influence rand used her memory of the british democratic socialist harold laski to help her imagine what toohey would do in a given situation she attended a new york lecture by laski as part of gathering material for the novel , following which she changed the physical appearance of the character to be similar to that of laski new york intellectuals lewis mumford and clifton fadiman also helped inspire the character when rand first arrived in new york as an immigrant from the soviet union in 1926 , she was greatly impressed by the manhattan skyline 's towering skyscrapers , which she saw as symbols of freedom , and resolved that she would write about them the original story by dudley murphy was about two construction workers working on a skyscraper who are rivals for a woman 's love demille rejected rand 's script , and the completed film followed murphy 's original idea in 1928 , rand made notes for a proposed , but never written , novel titled the little street rand began the fountainhead ( originally titled second-hand lives ) following the completion of her first novel , we the living , in 1934 that earlier novel was based in part on people and events familiar to rand ; the new novel , on the other hand , focused on the less-familiar world of architecture rand wanted to write a novel that was less overtly political than we the living , to avoid being viewed as '' a 'one-theme ' author '' as she developed the story , she began to see more political meaning in the novel 's ideas about individualism rand also planned to introduce the novel 's four sections with quotes from friedrich nietzsche , whose ideas had influenced her own intellectual development , but she eventually decided that nietzsche 's ideas were too different from hers she also completed a stage adaptation of we the living that ran briefly in 1940 when rand finally found a publisher , the novel was only one-third complete although she was a previously published novelist and had a night of january 16th , rand had difficulty finding a publisher for the fountainhead macmillan publishing , which had published we the living , rejected the book after rand insisted they provide more publicity for her new novel than they had done for the first one while rand was working as a script reader for paramount pictures , her boss put her in touch with the bobbs-merrill company a recently hired editor , archibald ogden , liked the book , but two internal reviewers gave conflicting opinions one said it was a great book that would never sell ; the other said it was trash but would sell well she also got a 1,000 advance so she could work full-time to complete the novel by january 1 , 1943 rand 's working title for the book was second-hand lives , but ogden pointed out that this emphasized the story 's villains rand offered the mainspring as an alternative , but this title had been recently used for another book helen shaw 's review for the village voice said the adaptation was unwatchable because it portrayed rand 's characters and views seriously without undercutting them the reviewer for the financial times said the play was too long and that hove had approached rand 's '' noxious '' book with too much reverence in a mixed review for the new york times , critic ben brantley complimented hove for capturing rand 's '' sheer pulp appeal '' , but described the material as '' hokum with a whole lot of ponderous speeches '' a review for the huffington post complimented van hove 's ability to portray rand 's message , but said the play was an hour too long
