'' selden said '' that no charter can make a gentleman , which is cited as out of the mouth of some great princes who have said it , '' because '' they , without question , understood gentleman for generosus in the antient sense , or as if it came from genii/geni in that sense '' in contemporary usage , the word gentleman is ambiguously defined , because '' to behave like a gentleman '' communicates as little praise or as much criticism as the speaker means to imply ; thus , '' to spend money like a gentleman '' is criticism , but '' to conduct a business like a gentleman '' is praise in the 16th century , the clergyman william harrison said that '' gentlemen be those whom their race and blood , or at the least their virtues , do make noble and known '' in that time , a gentleman usually was expected to have a coat of arms , it being accepted that only a gentleman could have a coat of arms , as indicated in an account of how gentlemen were made in the day of william shakespeare : gentlemen whose ancestors are not known to come in with william i of england ( for of the saxon races yet remaining we now make none accompt , much less of the british issue ) do take their beginning in england after this manner in our times who soever studieth the laws of the realm , who so abideth in the university , giving his mind to his book , or professeth physic and the liberal arts , or beside his service in the room of a captain in the wars , or good counsel given at home , whereby his commonwealth is benefited , can live without manual labour , and thereto is able and will bear the port , charge and countenance of a gentleman , he shall for money have a coat and arms bestowed upon him by heralds ( who in the charter of the same do of custom pretend antiquity and service ) and thereunto being made so good cheap be called master , which is the title that men give to esquires and gentlemen , and reputed for a gentleman ever after being called also to the wars ( for with the government of the commonwealth he medleth little ) what soever it cost him , he will both array and arm himself accordingly , and show the more manly courage , and all the tokens of the person which he representeth and gentlemen in england now abed shall think themselves accurs 'd they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap whilst any speaks that fought with us upon st the fundamental idea of '' gentry '' , symbolised in this grant of coat-armour , had come to be that of the essential superiority of the fighting man , and , as selden points out ( page 707 ) , the fiction was usually maintained in the granting of arms '' to an ennobled person though of the long robe wherein he hath little use of them as they mean a shield in east asia , the characteristics of a gentleman are based upon the principles of confucianism , wherein the term jūnzǐ ( 君子 ) denotes and identifies the '' son of a ruler '' , a '' prince '' , a '' noble man '' ; and the ideals that conceptually define '' gentleman '' , '' proper man '' , and a '' perfect man '' that a distinct order of landed gentry existed in england very early has , indeed , been often assumed and is supported by weighty authorities page 540 b , 9th edition ) said : '' early in the 11th century the order of 'gentlemen ' as a separate class seems to be forming as something new even as late as 1400 , the word gentleman still only had the descriptive sense of generosus and could not be used as denoting the title of a class these men , under the old system , had no definite status ; but they were generosi , men of birth , and , being now forced to describe themselves , they disdained to be classed with franklins ( now sinking in the social scale ) , still more with yeomen or husbandmen ; they chose , therefore , to be described as '' gentlemen '' as to the connection of gentilesse with the official grant or recognition of coat-armour , that is a profitable fiction invented and upheld by the heralds ; for coat-armour was the badge assumed by gentlemen to distinguish them in battle , and many gentlemen of long descent never had occasion to assume it and never did this fiction , however , had its effect , and by the 16th century , as has been already pointed out , the official view had become clearly established that gentlemen constituted a distinct social order and that the badge of this distinction was the heralds ' recognition of the right to bear arms however , some undoubtedly '' gentle '' families of long descent never obtained official rights to bear a coat of arms , the family of strickland being an example , which caused some consternation when lord strickland applied to join the order of malta in 1926 and could prove no right to a coat of arms , although his direct male ancestor had carried the english royal banner of st merchants are still '' citizens '' to william harrison ; but he adds '' they often change estate with gentlemen , as gentlemen do with them , by a mutual conversion of the one into the other a frontier line between classes so indefinite could not be maintained in some societies such as england , where there was never a '' nobiliary prefix '' to stamp a person as a gentleman , as opposed to france or germany the word gentleman as an index of rank had already become of doubtful value before the great political and social changes of the 19th century gave to it a wider and essentially higher significance '' in the 8th edition ( 1856 ) , this is still its '' most extended sense '' ; '' in a more limited sense '' it is defined in the same words as those quoted above from the 5th edition ; but the writer adds , '' by courtesy this title is generally accorded to all persons above the rank of common tradesmen when their manners are indicative of a certain amount of refinement and intelligence '' the reform act 1832 did its work ; the middle classes came into their own , and the word gentleman came in common use to signify not a distinction of blood , but a distinction of position , education and manners by this usage , the test is no longer good birth or the right to bear arms , but the capacity to mingle on equal terms in good society '' the word gentle , originally implying a certain social status , had very early come to be associated with the standard of manners expected from that status another relatively recent usage of gentleman is as a prefix to another term to imply that a man has sufficient wealth and free time to pursue an area of interest without depending on it for his livelihood
