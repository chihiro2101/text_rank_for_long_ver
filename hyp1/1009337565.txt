the idea that regulation of interstate commerce may to some extent be an exclusive federal power was discussed even before adoption of the constitution on september 15 , 1787 , the framers of the constitution debated in philadelphia whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of tonnage without congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of harbors and the building of lighthouses james madison believed that the mere existence of the commerce clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage : '' madison was more and more convinced that the regulation of commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority '' sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power , the latter being one of the concurrent powers shared by the federal and state governments , marshall wrote : '' we do not think that the state act empowering the black bird creek marsh company to place a dam across the creek , can , under all the circumstances of the case , be considered as repugnant to the power to regulate commerce in its dormant state , or as being in conflict with any law passed on the subject if marshall was suggesting that the power over interstate commerce is an exclusive federal power , the dormant commerce clause doctrine eventually developed very differently : it treats regulation that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce as a concurrent power , rather than an exclusive federal power , and it treats regulation that does so as an exclusive federal power thus , the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but '' not absolutely exclusive '' curtis wrote for the court : '' either absolutely to affirm , or deny that the nature of this commerce power requires exclusive legislation by congress , is to lose sight of the nature of the subjects of this power , and to assert concerning all of them , what is really applicable but to a part justice anthony kennedy has written that : '' the central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism , laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the constitution was designed to prevent on the other hand , when a law is '' directed to legitimate local concerns , with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental '' , that is , where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade , the court has adopted a much more flexible approach , the general contours of which were outlined in pike v in pike , the court explained that a state regulation having only '' incidental '' effects on interstate commerce '' will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits '' whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities '' thus regulation designed to implement public health and safety , or serve other legitimate state interests , but impact interstate commerce as an incident to that purpose , are subject to a test akin to the rational basis test , a minimum level of scrutiny over the years , the supreme court has consistently held that the language of the commerce clause contains a further , negative command prohibiting certain state taxation even when congress has failed to legislate on the subject application of the dormant commerce clause to state taxation is another manifestation of the court 's holdings that the commerce clause prevents a state from retreating into economic isolation or jeopardizing the welfare of the nation as a whole , as it would do if it were free to place burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear in its early stages , the court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly immune from state taxation '' in any form '' , '' even though the same amount of tax should be laid on ( intrastate ) commerce '' this position gave way in time to a less uncompromising but formal approach , according to which , for example , the court would invalidate a state tax levied on gross receipts from interstate commerce , or upon the '' freight carried '' in interstate commerce , but would allow a tax merely measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce as long as the tax was formally imposed upon franchises , or '' 'in lieu of all taxes upon ( the taxpayer 's ) property , ' '' dissenting from this formal approach in 1927 , justice stone remarked that it was '' too mechanical , too uncertain in its application , and too remote from actualities , to be of value accompanying the revolution in approach in the court 's congressional powers jurisprudence , the new deal court began to change its approach to state taxation as well the court explained that '' it was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business in the first , a tax imposed by the state of virginia on american business concerns operating within the state was struck down because it was a business privilege tax imposed on the privilege of doing business in interstate commerce the court long since had recognized that interstate commerce may be made to pay its way the court there explained : appellant 's attack is based solely on decisions of this court holding that a tax on the '' privilege '' of engaging in an activity in the state may not be applied to an activity that is part of interstate commerce complete auto transit is the last in a line of cases that gradually rejected a per se approach to state taxation challenges under the commerce clause in overruling prior decisions which struck down privilege taxes per se , the court noted the following , in what has become a central component of commerce clause state taxation jurisprudence : we note again that no claim is made that the activity is not sufficiently connected to the state to justify a tax , or that the tax is not fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer , or that the tax discriminates against interstate commerce , or that the tax is not fairly apportioned in addition to satisfying the four-prong test in complete auto transit , the supreme court has held state taxes which burden international commerce can not create a substantial risk of multiple taxations and must not prevent the federal government from '' speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments '' the iowa supreme court rejected a commerce clause claim because kraft failed to show '' that iowa businesses receive a commercial advantage over foreign commerce due to iowa 's taxing scheme '' considering an equal protection clause challenge , the iowa supreme court held that the use of the federal government 's definitions of income were convenient for the state and was '' rationally related to the goal of administrative efficiency '' the supreme court rejected the notion that administrative convenience was a sufficient defense for subjecting foreign commerce to a higher tax burden than interstate commerce the supreme court held that '' a state 's preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the commerce clause even if the state 's own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination 313 , ( 1890 ) ( striking down a minnesota statute that required any meat sold within the state , whether originating within or without the state , to be examined by an inspector within the state ) ; foster-fountain packing co for about a decade , the use of regulation to channel private commerce to designated private disposal sites was greatly restricted as the result of the carbone decision discussed below in some locales , choice of the flow control device was driven by state bonding laws , or municipal finance concerns if a county or other municipality issued general obligation bonds for construction of a costly incinerator , for example , state laws might require a special approval process ironically , these public-private efforts often took the form of local processing requirements which ultimately ran afoul of the commerce clause the town of clarkstown 's ordinance was designed and written right in the teeth of the long line of supreme court cases which had historically struck down local processing requirements a long line of supreme court case law had struck down local processing requirements when applied to goods or services in interstate commerce because it attains this goal by depriving competitors , including out-of-state firms , of access to a local market , we hold that the flow control ordinance violates the commerce clause as the court wrote : '' the case decided today , while perhaps a small new chapter in that course of decisions , rests nevertheless upon well-settled principles of our commerce clause jurisprudence '' and , the court made it plain , that the problem with clarkstown 's ordinance was that it created a local processing requirement protective of a local private processing company : in this light , the flow control ordinance is just one more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid '' the court decided that the balancing test should apply , because the regulatory scheme favored the government owned facility , but treated all private facilities equally these important responsibilities set state and local government apart from a typical private business dramatic price hikes were not uncommon : in 1986 , for example , a county contractor doubled its waste disposal rate on six weeks ' notice the court would not interfere with local government 's efforts to solve an important public and safety problem the contrary approach of treating public and private entities the same under the dormant commerce clause would lead to unprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts with state and local government the dormant commerce clause is not a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake , and what activities must be the province of private market competition the citizens could have left the entire matter for the private sector , in which case any regulation they undertook could not discriminate against interstate commerce it is not the office of the commerce clause to control the decision of the voters on whether government or the private sector should provide waste management services the history of commerce clause jurisprudence evidences a distinct difference in approach where the state is seeking to exercise its public health and safety powers , on the one hand , as opposed to attempting to regulate the flow of commerce the exact dividing line between the two interests , the right of states to exercise regulatory control over their public health and safety , and the interest of the national government in unfettered interstate commerce is not always easy to discern one court has written as follows : not surprisingly , the court 's effort to preserve a national market has , on numerous occasions , come into conflict with the states ' traditional power to '' legislate on all subjects relating to the health , life , and safety of their citizens on these occasions , the supreme court has '' struggled ( to put it nicely ) to develop a set of rules by which we may preserve a national market without needlessly intruding upon the states ' police powers , each exercise of which no doubt has some effect on the commerce of the nation a frequently cited example of the deference afforded to the powers of state and local government may be found in exxon corp '' the fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not , by itself establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce , '' the court wrote the court found that the existence of a burden on out-of-state plastic industry was not 'clearly excessive ' in comparison to the state 's interest in promoting conservation when a state statute regarding safety matters applies equally to interstate and intrastate commerce , the courts are generally reluctant to invalidate it even if it may have some impact on interstate commerce for example , when a state is contracting for the construction of a building or selling maps to state parks , rather than passing laws governing construction or dictating the price of state park maps , it is acting '' in the market '' the court held that because the state was merely attaching conditions to its expenditure of state funds , the maryland program affected the market no differently than if maryland were a private company bidding up the price of auto hulks '' nothing in the purposes animating the commerce clause prohibits a state , in the absence of congressional action , from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others the supreme court stated , '' when a state or local government enters the market as a participant it is not subject to the restraints of the commerce clause nothing in the constitution precludes a local government from hiring a local company precisely because it is local south-central timber holds that the market-participant doctrine is limited in allowing a state to impose burdens on commerce within the market in which it is a participant , but allows it to go no further the state may not impose conditions that have a substantial regulatory effect outside of that particular market the '' market participation exception '' to the dormant commerce clause does not give states unlimited authority to favor local interests , because limits from other laws and constitutional limits still apply similarly , congress has the power itself under the commerce clause to regulate and sanction states acting as '' market participants '' , but it lacks power to legislate in ways that violate article iv 432 , 493 ( 1941 ) ( arguing that historical evidence '' supports the view that , as to the restricted field which was deemed at the time to constitute regulation of commerce , the grant of power to the federal government presupposed the withdrawal of authority pari passu from the states
