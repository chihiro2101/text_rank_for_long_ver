in asimov 's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule , there is at least one carbon atom such that , while two of the carbon 's four chemical bonds lie in normal spacetime , one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past some months later asimov was alarmed to see the piece appear in the march 1948 issue of astounding under his own name , and copies of the issue circulated at the columbia chemistry department the article made asimov famous for the first time outside science fiction , as chemists shared copies of the article it also claims that one effect is that when people with multiple personalities add the water , some parts of the thiotimoline dissolve before others , due to some of the individual 's personalities being more determined than others instead of a fake scientific paper , this third article took the form of an address by asimov to the 12th annual meeting of the american chronochemical society , a nonexistent scientific society in his address , asimov '' describes '' his first experiments with thiotimoline in july 1947 , and timing the compound 's dissolution with the original endochronometer , '' the same instrument now at the smithsonian '' according to asimov , two scottish researchers have developed a '' telechronic battery '' , which uses a series of 77,000 interconnected endochronometers to allow a final sample of thiotimoline to dissolve up to a day before water is added to an initial sample asimov says there is '' strong , if indirect , evidence that the soviet union possesses even more sophisticated devices and is turning them out in commercial quantities '' finally , asimov describes attempts to create a '' heisenberg failure '' , to get a sample of thiotimoline to dissolve without later adding water to it several attempts to create a heisenberg failure in the mid-1950s coincided with a series of hurricanes striking new england in such a manner as to suggest that nature would find a way to add water whatever man decided , if man were to be resolute in not adding water '' thiotimoline and the space age '' appeared in the october 1960 issue of astounding , which was then in the final stages of changing its name to analog the story appeared in the november 1971 issue of analog science fiction/science fact barr 's story '' antithiotimoline '' deals with a chemist who accidentally creates a thiotimoline-like compound which extrudes only into the past , enabling the scientist to create images of past events spider robinson 's story '' mirror mirror , off the wall '' , published in time travelers strictly cash in 1981 , also references thiotimoline a research note can be found in one location which makes reference to '' thiomotilene crystals '' and their '' endochronic properties '' , which in turn strongly suggests motilene 's name be derived from thiotimoline
