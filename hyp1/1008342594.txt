a higher temperature of recorded at signy research station on 30 january 1982 was the record for the antarctic region encompassing all land and ice south of 60° s satellite measurements have identified even lower ground temperatures , with having been observed at the cloud-free antarctic plateau on 10 august 2010 along the antarctic peninsula , temperatures as high as have been recorded , though the summer temperature is below most of the time if all the land-ice covering antarctica were to melt — around of ice — the seas would rise by over the antarctic is so cold that even with increases of a few degrees , temperatures would generally remain below the melting point of ice this would increase the amount of ice in antarctica , offsetting approximately one third of the expected sea level rise from thermal expansion of the oceans for the contribution of antarctica to present and future sea level change , see sea level rise the majority of ice shelf consists of floating ice , and a lesser amount consists of glaciers that move slowly from the land mass into the sea if ice shelves break up , the ice flow behind them may accelerate , resulting in increasing melt of the antarctic ice sheet and an increasing contribution to sea level known changes in coastline ice around the antarctic peninsula : 1936–1989 : wordie ice shelf significantly reduced in size 2015 : a study concluded that the remaining larsen b ice-shelf will disintegrate by the end of the decade , based on observations of faster flow and rapid thinning of glaciers in the area the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of antarctica is positive – that is , the temperature is increasing – and significant at more than per decade since 1957 although this is partly offset by fall cooling in east antarctica , this effect is restricted to the 1980s and 1990s the british antarctic survey , which has undertaken the majority of britain 's scientific research in the area , stated in 2009 : west antarctic ice loss could contribute to sea level rise antarctica predicted to warm by around over this century 10 % increase in sea ice around the antarctic rapid ice loss in parts of the antarctic warming of the southern ocean will cause changes in antarctic ecosystem hole in ozone layer , which has delayed the impact of greenhouse gas increases on antarctica 's climate the area of strongest cooling appears at the south pole , and the region of strongest warming lies along the antarctic peninsula in their latest study ( 20 september 2007 ) nasa researchers have confirmed that antarctic snow is melting farther inland from the coast over time , melting at higher altitudes than ever and increasingly melting on antarctica 's largest ice shelf
