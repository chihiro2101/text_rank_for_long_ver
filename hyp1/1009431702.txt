, a welsh cloth worker , and baptised at the church of st bartholomew-the-less , little is known about jones 's early years he did not approach the architectural profession in the traditional way , namely either by rising up from a craft or through early exposure to the office of works , although there is evidence that christopher wren obtained information that recorded jones as an apprentice joiner in st paul 's cathedral colvin , howard , a biographical dictionary of british architects : 1600 to 1840 ( 1954 ) at some point before 1603 a rich patron ( possibly the earl of pembroke or the earl of rutland ) sent him to italy to study drawing after being impressed by the quality of his sketches jones 's first recorded architectural design is for a monument to frances , lady cotton , commissioned by rowland cotton , circa 1608–1611 , giles worsley , inigo jones and the european classical tradition ( yale , 2007 ) , pp in the following years , jones made drawings for the earl of salisbury 's new exchange in the strand , where work commenced in june 1608 , giles worsley , inigo jones and the european classical tradition ( yale , 2007 ) , p in 1609 , having perhaps accompanied salisbury 's son and heir , viscount cranborne , around france , he appears as an architectural consultant at hatfield house , making small modifications to the design as the project progressed , and in 1610 , jones was appointed surveyor to prince henry on 27 april 1613 , jones was appointed the position of surveyor of the king 's works and shortly after , embarked on a tour of italy with the earl of arundel , destined to become one of the most important patrons in the history of english art he was probably the first englishman to study these roman remains first hand and this was key to the new architecture jones introduced in england in september 1615 , jones was appointed surveyor-general of the king 's works , marking the beginning of jones 's career in earnest as the king 's surveyor , jones built some of his key buildings in london the whitehall palace was one of several projects where jones worked with his personal assistant and nephew by marriage john webb in the design of st paul 's , jones faithfully adhered to vitruvius 's design for a tuscan temple and it was the first wholly and authentically classical church built in england jones also designed the square of lincoln 's inn fields , and a house in the square , the lindsey house built in 1640 , is often attributed to jones also around this time , circa 1638 , jones devised drawings completely redesigning the palace of whitehall , but the execution of these designs was frustrated by charles i 's financial and political difficulties according to architecture historian john summerson , the modern concept of an architect 's artistic responsibility for a building did not exist at that time , and jones 's role in many instances may be that of a civil servant in getting things done rather than as an architect in the 1630s , jones was in high demand and , as surveyor to the king , his services were only available to a very limited circle of people , so often projects were commissioned to other members of the works jones is also thought to have been involved in another country house , this time in wiltshire wilton house was renovated from about 1630 onwards , at times worked on by jones , then passed on to isaac de caus when jones was too busy with royal clients one of jones 's design work was '' double cube '' room , and it was also the foundation stone of his status as the father of british architecture he was , however , closely involved in the design of coleshill house , in berkshire , for the pratt family , which he visited with the young apprentice architect roger pratt , to fix a new site for the proposed mansion there is an inigo jones road in charlton , south east london ( se7 ) , near charlton house , some of whose features were allegedly designed by him
