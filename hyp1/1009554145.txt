the original complaint did n't mentioned any specific statutes , but the case later dealt with three laws for public schools in alabama : the first law ( 1978 ) created a minute of silence for meditation , the second law ( 1981 ) added the option of voluntary prayer , and the third law ( 1982 ) authorized teachers to recite a prayer with “ willing students the court first noted that '' the proposition that the several states have no greater power to restrain the individual freedoms protected by the first amendment than does the united states congress '' is '' firmly embedded in our constitutional jurisprudence '' and that '' the first amendment was adopted to curtail the power of congress to interfere with the individual 's freedom to believe , to worship , and to express himself in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience '' the '' lemon test , '' previously created by the court to help determine whether legislation violates the establishment clause , included as a factor that '' the statute must have a secular legislative purpose , '' and the court further held in jaffree that '' the first amendment requires that a statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion '' the record in the case showed not only that the alabama law '' was not motivated by any clearly secular purpose '' but that '' indeed , the statute had no secular purpose '' with no secular purpose behind the law , and because it expanded a previous law that already allowed for meditation so that it now explicitly included '' voluntary prayer '' as well , the only possible conclusion was that the new law was passed '' for the sole purpose of expressing the state 's endorsement of prayer activities for one minute at the beginning of each schoolday '' since '' such an endorsement is not consistent with the established principle that the government must pursue a course of complete neutrality toward religion , '' the court ruled in favor of jaffree and upheld the eleventh circuit 's decision also in his first point , he contests the decision with the point that a school is constitutionally on the same level of government as state and federal legislatures and even the supreme court upon the subject of the statute 's sponsor 's comments , he raises many points that work to invalidate the use of the statements as evidence for the original intent of the legislature at the time of the statute 's enactment he suggests that the use of the test ignores the court 's duty to examine the statute against the ideas of the establishment clause and that the decision of the case clearly shows this shortcoming in his conclusion , justice burger reiterates the fact that the statute was not an unconstitutional endorsement and promotion of religion that sought to establish a state church , but an entirely constitutional measure designed to prevent truly unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of students to pray individually as they please justice rehnquist suggests , instead , that one turn to the actions of the congress and james madison 's significant role in it for insight into the original intent of the establishment clause after some time of debate and revision , a version what is now the first amendment was created : “ no religion shall be established by law , nor shall the equal rights of conscience be infringed thus , says rehnquist , one can see indisputably that the spirit in which the congress approved the establishment clause was one of open-minded toleration , not one of hostility towards religion
