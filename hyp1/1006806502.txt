subsequently , he was transferred , perhaps through cromwell 's influence , to the service of the king , and in january 1532 he was sent to rome as the king 's agent when the question of the king 's divorce was raised in october 1533 he was entrusted with the task of suggesting to clement vii ( while he was the guest of francis i at marseille ) henry 's appeal from the pope to a general council ; but there seems to be no good authority for gilbert burnet 's story that clement threatened to have him burnt alive during the following years he was much employed on important embassies in the king 's interests , first to the pope to appeal against the excommunication pronounced in july 1533 , afterwards to the emperor to dissuade him from attending the general council which the pope wished to summon at vicenza he seems , however , to have pleased his patron , cromwell , and perhaps henry , by his energy in seeing the king 's '' great '' bible in english through the press in paris he was already king 's chaplain ; his appointment at paris had been accompanied by promotion to the see of hereford ( 27 november 1538 ) but owing to his absence he could neither be consecrated nor take possession of his see , and he was still abroad when he was translated to the bishopric of london ( october 1539 ) there was nothing in the reformation to appeal to him , except the repudiation of papal control ; and he was one of those numerous englishmen whose views were faithfully reflected in henry 's act of the six articles indeed , almost his first duty as bishop of london was to try heretics under these articles ; accusations of excessive cruelty and bias against the accused were spread broadcast by his enemies , and from the first he seems to have been unpopular in london the death of the king on 28 january 1547 , proved the turning point in bonner 's career therefore , from the first he put himself in opposition to the religious changes introduced by protector somerset and thomas cranmer bonner began to doubt that supremacy when he saw to what uses it could be put by a protestant council , and either he or gardiner evolved the theory that the royal supremacy was in abeyance during a royal minority it was on this question that he came into conflict with edward 's government when these became law , he neglected to enforce them , and on 1 september 1549 he was required by the council to maintain at st paul 's cross that the royal authority was as great as if the king were forty years of age after a struggle the protestant faction gained the upper hand , and on 7 february 1550 bonner 's deprivation was confirmed by the council sitting in the star chamber , and he was further condemned to perpetual imprisonment , where he remained until the accession of mary in 1553 mary 's administration thought that religious dissidents would best be dealt with by ecclesiastical tribunals rather than by the civil power '' his apologists , including defenders of catholicism in england , claim his actions were merely '' official '' , and that '' he had no control '' over the fate of the accused '' once they were declared to be irreclaimable heretics and handed over to the secular power ; but he always strove by gentle suasion first to reconcile them to the church '' ; the catholic encyclopedia estimates the number of persons executed as heretics in his jurisdiction as about 120 , rather than 300 many of his victims were forced upon him by the king and queen in council , which at one point addressed a letter to bonner on the express ground that he was not proceeding with sufficient severity when the parliament of 1563 met , a new act was passed by which the first refusal of the oath of royal supremacy was praemunire , the second , high treason the bishops had refused the oath once , so that by this act , which became law on 10 april 1563 , their next refusal of the oath might be followed by their death lord acton in the cambridge modern history ( 1904 ) argued : '' the number of those put to death in his diocese of london was undoubtedly disproportionately large , but this would seem to have been more the result of the strength of the reforming element in the capital and in essex than of the employment of exceptional rigour ; while the evidence also shows that he himself patiently dealt with many of the protestants , and did his best to induce them to renounce what he conscientiously believed to be their errors
