bee flies of the family bombyliidae often mimic hymenoptera and hover around flowers , as well , rendering some bombyliid species hard to tell apart from syrphidae at first glance unlike adults , the maggots of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods ; some are saprotrophs , eating decaying plant or animal matter , while others are insectivores , eating aphids , thrips , and other plant-sucking insects predatory species are beneficial to farmers and gardeners , as aphids destroy crops , and hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control this includes one of the most common widespread hoverfly species , syritta pipiens , whose larvae feed on aphids certain species are more common in certain areas than others ; for example , the american hoverfly , eupeodes americanus , is common in the nearctic realm , and the common hoverfly , melangyna viridiceps , is common in the australasian realm while some hoverfly larvae are aquatic and are often found in stagnant water , those of species that prey upon aphids and other plant parasites are usually terrestrial , residing on leaves hoverflies are important pollinators of flowering plants in many ecosystems worldwide like many pollinator groups , syrphid flies range from species that take a generalist approach to foraging by visiting a wide range of plant species through those that specialize in a narrow range of plants although hoverflies are often considered mainly nonselective pollinators , some hoverflies species are highly selective and carry pollen from one plant species specific flower preferences differ among species , but syrphid fly species have repeatedly been shown to prefer white- and yellow-coloured flowers also , a number of fascinating interactions occur between orchids and hoverflies another plant , the slipper orchid in southwest china , also achieves pollination by deceit by exploiting the innate yellow color preference of syrphids coriander and tansy leaf are particularly attractive to many species of adults , which feed on their pollen native flies ( allograpta and platycheirus ) in alpine zones show preferences for flower species based on their colour in alpine zones ; syrphid flies consistently choose yellow flowers over white regardless of species larvae of many hoverfly species prey upon pest insects , including aphids and leafhoppers , which spread some diseases such as curly top , so they are seen in biocontrol as a natural means of reducing the levels of pests the island is a hotspot for hoverflies and other insects ; sj√∂berg has collected 58 species of butterflies there , and ( in seven years of hunting ) 202 species of hoverflies , including 180 in his garden
