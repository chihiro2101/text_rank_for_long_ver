there is specialized equipment used by team ropers : rope - made of synthetic fibers , used to rope the steer , there are two kinds of ropes , one for the header ( the person who ropes the head ) and one for the heeler ( the person who ropes the legs ) then , one at a time , a steer is moved into a chute with spring-loaded doors in front and a solid gate behind , so that only one animal is released at a time the header is on one side ( usually the left , for a right-handed header ) whose job is to rope the steer around the horns , then turn the steer so its hind legs can be roped by the '' heeler '' , who starts from the box on the other side of the chute a taut rope , called the barrier , runs in front of the header 's box and is fastened to an easily released rope on the neck of the steer of a designated length , used to ensure that the steer gets a head start the header must rope the steer with one of three legal catches : a clean horn catch around both horns , a neck catch around the neck or a half-head catch around the neck and one horn once the header has made the dally , the rider turns the horse , usually to the left , and the steer will follow , still running some of the rules common to most groups include : both riders must start from inside the box if the barrier is broken there is a 10-second or 5-second penalty depending on organization if the heeler catches only one leg there is a 5-second penalty the heeler can not throw unless the head of the steer is turned the header has three possible legal catches : both horns one horn and the nose ( half-head ) the neck any other head catch is considered illegal heelers use a different technique , a right-handed heeler will twirl the loop on the left side of the rider 's body , always keeping the tip of the loop on the left side so that when the loop is thrown , it will go under the steer the lay of the loop is also very important ; it should stand up against the steer 's legs with the bottom loop on the ground so the steer will jump right into it
