intravenous ( iv ) access is used to administer medications and fluid replacement which must be distributed throughout the body , especially when rapid distribution is desired another use of iv administration is the avoidance of first-pass metabolism in the liver fluids may be administered as part of '' volume expansion '' , or fluid replacement , through the intravenous route compared with other route of administration , such as oral medications , the iv route is the fastest way to deliver fluids and medications throughout the body in extremely high blood pressure ( termed a hypertensive emergency ) , iv antihypertensives may be given to quickly decrease the blood pressure in a controlled manner to prevent organ damage for this reason certain types of medications can only be given intravenously , as there is insufficient uptake by other routes of administration whether a medication can be potentially switched to an oral form is sometimes considered when choosing appropriate antibiotic therapy for use in a hospital setting , as a person is unlikely to be discharged if they are still requiring iv therapy blood transfusions can be used in massive blood loss due to trauma , or can be used to replace blood lost during surgery early blood transfusions consisted of whole blood , but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood , such as packed red blood cells , fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate certain medications , such as potassium , are not able to be administered by iv push due to the extremely rapid onset of action and high level of effects an infusion of medication may be used when it is desirable to have a constant blood concentration of a medication over time , such as with some antibiotics including beta-lactams continuous infusions , where the next infusion is begun immediately following the completion of the prior , may also be used to limit variation in drug concentration in the blood ( i.e they may also be used instead of intermittent bolus injections for the same reason , such as with furosemide intermittent infusion may be used when there are concerns about the stability of medicine in solution for long periods of time ( as is common with continuous infusions ) , or to enable the administration of medicines which would be incompatible if administered at the same time in the same iv line , for example vancomycin any additional medication to be administered intravenously at the same time as an infusion may be connected to the primary tubing ; this is termed a secondary iv , or iv piggyback when administering a secondary iv medication , the primary bag is held lower than the secondary bag so that the secondary medication can flow into the primary tubing , rather than fluid from the primary bag flowing into the secondary tubing the fluid from the primary bag is needed to help flush any remaining medication from the secondary iv from the tubing the part of the catheter that remains outside the skin is called the connecting hub ; it can be connected to a syringe or an intravenous infusion line , or capped with a or saline lock , a needleless connection filled with a small amount of heparin or saline solution to prevent clotting , between uses of the catheter medication administered in this way travels through the veins to the heart , from where it is distributed to the rest of the body through the circulatory system the size of the peripheral vein limits the amount and rate of medication which can be administered safely blood samples may also be drawn from the line directly after the initial iv cannula insertion these lines are usually placed in peripheral veins in the arm , and may be placed using the seldinger technique under ultrasound guidance using a tunneled line reduces the risk of infection as compared to other forms of access , as bacteria from the skin surface are not able to travel directly into the vein a tunnelled line is an option for long term venous access necessary for hemodialysis in people with poor kidney function alternatively , an infusion pump may be used to allow precise control over the flow rate and total amount delivered a pump is programmed based on the number and size of infusions being administered to ensure all medicine is fully administered without allowing the access line to run dry to reduce pain associated with the procedure , medical staff may apply a topical local anaesthetic ( such as emla or ametop ) to the skin of the chosen venipuncture area about 45 minutes beforehand for this reason , when other forms of administration may suffice , intravenous therapy is usually not preferred the incidence of side effects specific to a medication can be affected by the type of access ( peripheral versus central ) , the rate of administration , or the quantity of drug administered when medications are administered too rapidly through an iv line , a set of vague symptoms such as redness or rash , fever , and others may occur - this is termed an '' infusion reaction '' and is prevented by decreasing the rate of administration of the medication as placement of an intravenous line requires breaking the skin , there is a risk of infection this may be caused by infection , the catheter itself , or the specific fluids or medication being given if placed with proper aseptic technique , it is not recommended to change a peripheral iv line more frequently than every 72–96 hours phlebitis is particularly common in intravenous drug users , and those undergoing chemotherapy , whose veins can become sclerotic and difficult to access over time , sometimes forming a hard , painful “ venous cord ” the presence of a cord is a cause of discomfort and pain associated with iv therapy , and makes it more difficult for an iv line to be placed as a line can not be placed in an area with a cord infiltration is one of the most common adverse effects of iv therapy and is usually not serious unless the infiltrated fluid is a medication damaging to the surrounding tissue , most commonly a vesicant or chemotherapeutic agent in hospitals , regular blood tests may be used to proactively monitor electrolyte levels
