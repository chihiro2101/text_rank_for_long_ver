the rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective this early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing 's small rear tyre the 1870s and 1880s saw the development of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today , with two wheels of equal size , initially with solid rubber tyres these were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism , but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears , allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals the relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of rim brakes the coaster brake was contained in the rear wheel hub , and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling , thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear in the united states , the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout the first half of the 20th century , often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle perhaps more so than any other form of bicycle brake , the spoon brake is sensitive to road conditions and increases tyre wear dramatically though made obsolete by the introduction of the duck brake , coaster brake , and rod brake , spoon brakes continued to be used in the west supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s , and on children 's bicycles until the 1950s braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar , which provided additional leverage when braking ( two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary ) used in combination with a rear coaster brake , a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake 198-233 : the spoon brake was fairly ineffective , while the coaster brake did not operate on the front tyre , the most effective position on a two-wheel vehicle during a hard stop rim brakes are so called because braking force is applied by friction pads to the rim of the rotating wheel , thus slowing it and the bicycle the light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting , or brake shoe , with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs ; brake pads of the cartridge type are held in place by a metal split pin or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment to the rim in general , a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads , as long as the mounting is compatible to minimise excessive rim wear , a brake pad should be hard enough that it does not embed road grit or chips of rim metal in the face of the pad , since these act as grinding/gouging agents and markedly reduce rim life rear brakes mounted behind the seat-tube supports experience precisely the opposite effect thus the front brake is typically more effective than the rear when the brakes are so mounted the '' rod-actuated brake '' , or simply '' rod brake '' , ( roller lever brake in raleigh terminology ) uses a series of rods and pivots , rather than bowden cables , to transmit force applied to a hand lever to pull friction pads upwards against the inner surface , which faces the hub , of the wheel rim caliper brakes tend to become less effective as tyres get wider , and so deeper , reducing the brakes ' mechanical advantage these brakes are simple and effective for relatively narrow tyres but have significant flex and resulting poor performance if the arms are made long enough to fit wide tyres dual-pivot brakes are slightly heavier than conventional side-pull calipers and can not accurately track an out-of-true rim , or a wheel that flexes from side to side in the frame during hard climbing they are more effective than side-pull brakes in long reach applications as the distance between the pivot and brake pad or cable attachment is much shorter , reducing flex thus u-brakes are often interchangeable with , and have the same maintenance issues as , roller cam brakes the u-brake 's main advantage over cantilever and linear-pull brakes in this application is that sideways protrusion of the brake and cable system is minimal , and the exposed parts are smooth the cantilever brake is a class of brake in which each arm is attached to a separate pivot point on one side of the seat stay or fork due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads , cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres , such as on mountain bikes because the arms move only in their designed arcs , the brake shoe must be adjustable in several planes when the mountain bike became popular , cantilever brakes were adopted for these too but the smaller mtb frames meant that riders often fouled the rear brake arms with their heels low profile brakes require more careful attention to cable geometry than traditional cantilevers but are now the most common type because the housing enters from vertically above one arm yet force must be transmitted laterally between arms , the flexible housing is extended by a rigid tube with a 90° bend known as the '' noodle '' ( a noodle with a 135° bend is used where the front brake is operated by the right hand , as this gives a smoother curve in the cable housing ) some high-end v-brakes use a four-pivot parallel motion so the brake pads contact at virtually the same position on the wheel rim regardless of wear v-brakes function well with the suspension systems found on many mountain bikes because they do not require a separate cable stop on the frame or fork because of the higher mechanical advantage of v-brakes , they require brake levers with longer cable travel than levers intended for older types of brakes cable-actuated ) disc brakes use the same amount of cable travel as v-brakes , except for those that are described as being '' road '' specific on the downside , their shorter arms provide very small tyre and wheel clearance and generally make for a less forgiving setup : they can only accommodate smaller tyre sizes compared to cantilever brakes , may pose problems for mounting fenders , can be clogged more easily by mud , and they can make it harder to change wheels v-brakes always use thin and relatively long brake pads private communication by jeff archer of the museum of mountain bike art & technology roller cam brakes were used on early mountain bikes in the 1980s and into the 1990s , mounted to the fork blades and seat stays in the standard locations , as well as below the chain stays for improved stiffness as they do not protrude to interfere with the crank many consider the brake attractive , and it has a lower wind profile than some other common brakes however , with high leverage , the stroke of the lever is not enough to fully apply the brake , so the rider can have brakes that feel normal in light braking but which can not be applied harder for hard braking this is one of the least common types of brakes they are mounted either on the same pivot points used for cantilever and linear-pull brakes or they can be mounted on four-bolt brake mounts found on many trials frames towards the end of the 2010s , disc brakes have become increasingly common also on racing bicycles many hydraulic disc brakes have a self-adjusting mechanism so as the brake pad wears , the pistons keep the distance from the pad to the disc consistent to maintain the same brake lever throw some hydraulic brakes , especially older ones , and most mechanical discs have manual controls to adjust the pad-to-rotor gap a mountain bicycle with disc brakes is less susceptible to mud buildup provided the rear frame and front fork yoke have sufficient clearance from the wheels disc brakes may be made of materials that dissipate heat better than the wheel rim , but undersized sport sized discs will be too small to take advantage of the fact there are holes in the rotor , providing a path for water and debris to get out from under the pads other reasons include : while all types of brakes will eventually wear out the braking surface , a brake disc is easier and cheaper to replace than a wheel rim or drum the use of very wide tyres favors disc brakes , as rim brakes require ever-longer arms to clear the wider tyre the same frame built for 29 '' tires can often also fit 27.5+ ( 650+ ) tires , despite the two wheel sizes having different rim diameters this is possible with disc brakes , so long as the rotor sizes are consistent and the frame has enough clearance ; with rim brakes , this would be impossible , as the different rim sizes would not allow the same rim brakes to work with a different sized wheel wheel size optionality with disc brakes allows the rider more options , including using a smaller diameter rim-sized wheel ( such as 27.5+ ) with a higher volume wider tire with the same outer diameter size as a larger rim-sized wheel ( such as 29 '' ) -- the outer diameter consistency is important as it preserves the geometry of the frame between the two different wheel sizes front hubs designed for discs often move the left hub 's flange inward to make room for the disc , which causes the wheel to be dished a rim brake works directly on the rim and the attached tyre ; a disc brake applies a potentially large torque moment at the hub an engineered disc brake would reduce weight by not having most of the metal rim components a front disc brake places a bending moment on the fork between the caliper anchor points and the tip of the dropout there have been some problems using disc brakes with certain frame designs as advantages of cable-actuated disc brakes are argued lower cost , lower maintenance , and lighter system weight , hydraulic disc brakes are said to offer more braking power and better control cable-actuated disc brakes were traditionally the only type of disc brake that could be used with the brake levers found on drop handlebars , sheldon brown , quoted at but this is no longer the case bending the rotor is theoretically inferior , but in practice gives good service , even under high-force braking with a hot disc , and may yield more progressiveness for disc brakes with a hydraulic system , high-performance calipers usually use two or three pistons per side ; lower-cost and lower-performance calipers often have only one per side it is also common to use a larger diameter rotor on the front wheel and a smaller rotor on the rear wheel since the front wheel does the most braking ( up to 90 % of the total )
