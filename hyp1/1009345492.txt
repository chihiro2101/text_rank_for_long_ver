'' a weak response was offered by the french , who put forward an environmental theory of human psychology anguilli called attention to the importance of the influence of the social environment upon crime professor alexandre lacassagne thought that the atavistic and degenerative theories as held by the italian school were exaggerations and false interpretations of the facts , and that the important factor was the social environment the anomalies observed by lombroso were met with in honest men as well as criminals , manouvrier claimed , and there is no physical difference between them in particular taine 's work helped to change the opinions of his contemporaries on the actions taken by the crowds during the 1789 revolution while it is difficult to directly link his works to crowd behavior , it may be said that his thoughts stimulated further study of crowd behavior two recent scholars , momboisse ( 1967 ) and berlonghi ( 1995 ) focused upon purpose of existence to differentiate among crowds suggestion refers to the period in which the ideas and emotions of the crowd are primarily drawn from a shared unconscious ideology additionally , le bon and others have indicated that crowd members feel a lessened sense of legal culpability , due to the difficulty in prosecuting individual members of a mob in short , the individual submerged in the crowd loses self control as the '' collective mind '' takes over and makes the crowd member capable of violating personal or social norms sigmund freud 's crowd behavior theory primarily consists of the idea that becoming a member of a crowd serves to unlock the unconscious mind furthermore , adorno stated the bond linking the masses to the leader through the spectacle is feigned : '' when the leaders become conscious of mass psychology and take it into their own hands , it ceases to exist in a certain sense they do not really identify themselves with him but act this identification , perform their own enthusiasm , and thus participate in their leader 's performance deindividuation theory is largely based on the ideas of gustave le bon and argues that in typical crowd situations , factors such as anonymity , group unity , and arousal can weaken personal controls ( e.g more recent theories have stated that deindividuation hinges upon a person being unable , due to situation , to have strong awareness of their self as an object of attention when private aspects of self are weakened , one becomes more subject to crowd impulses , but not necessarily in a negative way convergence theory holds that crowd behavior is not a product of the crowd , but rather the crowd is a product of the coming together of like-minded individuals '' convergence theory holds that crowds form from people of similar dispositions , whose actions are then reinforced and intensified by the crowd convergence theory claims that crowd behavior is not irrational ; rather , people in crowds express existing beliefs and values so that the mob reaction is the rational product of widespread popular feeling however , this theory is questioned by certain research which found that people involved in the 1970s riots were less likely than nonparticipant peers to have previous convictions critics of this theory report that it still excludes the social determination of self and action , in that it argues that all actions of the crowd are born from the individuals ' intents emergent norm theory states that crowds have little unity at their outset , but during a period of milling about , key members suggest appropriate actions , and following members fall in line , forming the basis for the crowd 's norms when a crowd described as above targets an individual , anti-social behaviors may emerge within its members a major criticism of this theory is that the formation and following of new norms indicates a level of self-awareness that is often missing in the individuals in crowds ( as evidenced by the study of deindividuation ) additionally , the theory fails to explain why certain suggestions or individuals rise to normative status while others do not the social identity theory posits that the self is a complex system made up primarily of the concept of membership or non-membership in various social groups these groups have various moral and behavioral values and norms , and the individual 's actions depend on which group membership ( or non-membership ) is most personally salient at the time of action this influence is evidenced by findings that when the stated purpose and values of a group changes , the values and motives of its members also change in crowds which are more ambiguous , individuals will assume a new social identity as a member of the crowd the group identity serves to create a set of standards for behavior ; for certain groups violence is legitimate , for others it is unacceptable this standard is formed from stated values , but also from the actions of others in the crowd , and sometimes from a few in leadership-type positions
