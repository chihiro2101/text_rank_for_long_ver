in biblical hebrew , the idea of repentance is represented by two verbs : שוב shuv ( to return ) and נחם nacham ( to feel sorrow ) the doctrine of repentance as taught in the bible is a call to persons to make a radical turn from one way of life to another many rabbinic sources state that repentance is of paramount importance to the existence of this world , so that it was one of the seven provisions which god made before the creation talmud bavli , tractates pesahim 54a ; nedarim 39b ; midrash genesis rabbah 1 '' the holy one , blessed be his name , said to elijah , 'behold , the precious gift which i have bestowed on my world : though a man sins again and again , but returns in penitence , i will receive him though man ought to be penitent every day , mishna avoth chap 2 , 10 ; talmud shabbath 153a the first ten days of every year are the acceptable time announced by the prophet isaiah : '' seek the lord while he may be found , call upon him while he is near '' jewish doctrine holds that it is never too late , even on the day of death , to return to god with sincere repentance for '' as the sea is always open for every one who wishes to cleanse himself , so are the gates of repentance always open to the sinner '' ) jewish doctrine states that the hand of god is continually stretched out to receive a sinner '' return '' ) is used to refer to '' repentance '' the bible states that god 's loving-kindness is extended to the returning sinner in the first case , the manifestation of repentance consists in : ( 1 ) confession of one 's sin before god , the essential part being a solemn promise and firm resolve not to commit the same sin again however , the prophets disparaged all such outer manifestations of repentance , insisting rather on a complete change of the sinner 's mental and spiritual attitude in the new testament , one of many examples of repentance in the new testament can be found in the parable of the prodigal son found in in his pentecost sermon , peter the apostle called on people to repent , an appeal he repeated in his sermon at the beautiful gate of the temple : '' repent therefore , and return again to god , that your sins may be blotted out '' paul the apostle likewise testified '' both to jews and to greeks of repentance toward god '' and said that '' the times of ignorance god overlooked , but now he commands all people everywhere to repent '' the greek word used for repentance in the new testament is μετάνοια ( metanoia ) , and the greek verb for '' to repent '' is μετανοῶ , contracted from μετανο-έω ( metano-eo ) , as in mark 's account of the initial preaching of jesus : '' the time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of god has come near ; repent , and trust in the good news the protestant reformer john calvin wrote that repentance '' may be justly defined to be a true conversion of our life to god , proceeding from a serious fear of god , and consisting in the mortification of the flesh and of the old man , and in the vivification of the spirit in the first place , when we call repentance ' a conversion of the life to god ' , we require a transformation , not only in the external actions , but in the soul itself ; which , after having put off the old nature , should produce the fruits of actions corresponding to its renovation in the second place , we represented repentance as proceeding from a serious fear of god the word tawbah ( repentance ) in arabic literally means 'to return ' , and is mentioned in the quran '' at-tahriim 66:8 although repentance is considered as one act that can be used for cleansing the sins , the quran notes that all of the sins are forgiven with or without repentance except the state of shirk , i.e an-nisaa 4:48 islam does not accept the concept of original sin ; instead , it teaches that a person is born in a state of innocence and pure belief in mahayana buddhism , one of the most common repentance verses used for reflection is samantabhadra 's repentance verse taken from chapter 40 of the flower adornment sutra : for all the evil deeds i have done in the past created by my body , mouth , and mind , from beginningless greed , anger , and delusion , i now know shame and repent of them all
