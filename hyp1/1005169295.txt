leaving leipzig altogether , pufendorf relocated to university of jena , where he formed an intimate friendship with erhard weigel , the mathematician , whose influence helped to develop his remarkable independence of character he occupied himself in meditating upon what he had read in the works of hugo grotius and thomas hobbes , and mentally constructed a system of universal law the work was dedicated to charles louis , elector palatine , who created for pufendorf a new chair at the university of heidelberg , that of the law of nature and nations published under the cover of a pseudonym at geneva in 1667 , it was supposed to be addressed by a gentleman of verona , severinus de monzambano , to his brother laelius its author directly challenged the organization of the holy roman empire , denounced in the strongest terms the faults of the house of austria , and attacked with vigour the politics of the ecclesiastical princes he disputed hobbes 's conception of the state of nature and concluded that the state of nature is not one of war but of peace in his historical works , pufendorf wrote in a very dry style , but he professed a great respect for truth and generally drew from archival sources this work propounded for the first time the so-called '' collegial '' theory of church government ( kollegialsystem ) , which , developed later by the learned lutheran theologian , formed the basis of the relations of church and state in germany and more especially in prussia the theory was of importance because , by distinguishing church from state while preserving the essential supremacy of the latter , it prepared the way for the principle of toleration it was put into practice to a certain extent in prussia in the 18th century ; but it was not till the political changes of the 19th century led to a great mixture of confessions under the various state governments that it found universal acceptance in germany the theory , of course , has found no acceptance in the roman catholic church , but it nonetheless made it possible for the protestant governments to make a working compromise with rome in respect of the roman catholic church established in their states this work took largely the theories of grotius and many ideas from hobbes , adding to them pufendorf 's own ideas to develop the law of nations in terms of public law , which recognizes the state ( civitas ) as a moral person ( persona moralis ) , pufendorf argues that the will of the state is nevertheless nothing more than the sum of the individual wills that are associated within it ; hence the state needs to submit to a discipline essential for human safety
