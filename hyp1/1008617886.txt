researchers trace the origins of the blade back to the domestic sickle and the prehistoric bent stick used for hunting and later in hand-to-hand combat to reduce weight while keeping strength , the blade might be hollow forged , or a fuller is created various reasons are given for this , both practical and ceremonial : that it makes blood and sap drop off the blade rather than running onto the handle and thereby prevent the handle from becoming slippery ; that it delineates the end of the blade whilst sharpening ; that it is a symbol representing a cows ' foot , or shiva ; that it can catch another blade or kukri in combat the notch may also be used as a catch , to hold tight against a belt , or to bite onto twine to be suspended the handles are most often made of hardwood or water buffalo horn , but ivory , bone , and metal handles have also been produced traditionally , the scabbard also holds two smaller blades : an unsharpened checkmark to burnish the blade , and another accessory blade called a karda modern kukri blades are often forged from spring steel , sometimes collected from recycled suspension ( vehicle ) the tang of the blade usually extends all the way through to the end of the handle ; the small portion of the tang that projects through the end of the handle are hammered flat to secure the blade kukri handles , usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn , are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called laha ( also known as '' himalayan epoxy '' ) with a wood or horn handle , the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit , since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away some kukri ( such as the ones made by contractors for the modern indian army ) , have a very wide tang with handle slabs fastened on by two or more rivets , commonly called a full tang ( panawal ) configuration traditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team ; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade the wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by laha , the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a chakmak over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to steel their knives it can function as a smaller knife by using the narrower part of the blade , closest to the handle the heavier and wider end of the blade , towards the tip , functions as an axe or a small shovel butt cap ( chapri ) : thick metal/brass plate used to secure the handle to the tang bolster ( kanjo ) : thick metal/brass round shaped plate between blade and handle made to support and reinforce the fixture main body ( ang ) : main surface or panel of the blade especially used in army types strap/ridge ( bhunti ) : thick raw leather encircling the scabbard made to create a hump to secure the frog from moving or wobbling ( not available in this pic ) occasionally the western style is called budhuna , ( referring to a fish with a large head ) , or baspate ( bamboo leaf ) which refers to blades just outside the proportions of the normal sirupate blade
