'' at the age of 10 , soon after entering the gymnasium , he encountered a copy of conrad gessner 's historiae animalium , the work that first sparked his interest in natural history in his second paper in 1796 , he described and analyzed a large skeleton found in paraguay , which he would name megatherium together , these two 1796 papers were a seminal or landmark event , becoming a turning point in the history of paleontology , and in the development of comparative anatomy , as well he repeatedly emphasized that his extensive experience with fossil material indicated one fossil form does not , as a rule , gradually change into a succeeding , distinct fossil form according to the university of california museum of paleontology , '' cuvier did not believe in organic evolution , for any change in an organism 's anatomy would have rendered it unable to survive he studied the mummified cats and ibises that geoffroy had brought back from napoleon 's invasion of egypt , and showed they were no different from their living counterparts ; cuvier used this to support his claim that life forms did not evolve over time '' he also observed that napoleon 's expedition to egypt had retrieved animals mummified thousands of years previously that seemed no different from their modern counterparts de lamarck ) , cuvier wrote that lamarck 's theory of evolution instead , he said , the typical form makes an abrupt appearance in the fossil record , and persists unchanged to the time of its extinction cuvier 's claim that new fossil forms appear abruptly in the geological record and then continue without alteration in overlying strata was used by later critics of evolution to support creationism , to whom the abruptness seemed consistent with special divine creation ( although cuvier 's finding that different types made their paleontological debuts in different geological strata clearly did not ) in his essay on the theory of the earth , he did say , '' no human bones have yet been found among fossil remains '' , but he made it clear exactly what he meant : '' when i assert that human bones have not been hitherto found among extraneous fossils , i must be understood to speak of fossils , or petrifactions , properly so called '' ; english translation quoted from he was not dogmatic in this claim , however ; when new evidence came to light , he included in a later edition an appendix describing a skeleton that he freely admitted was an '' instance of a fossil human petrifaction '' the harshness of his criticism and the strength of his reputation , however , continued to discourage naturalists from speculating about the gradual transmutation of species , until charles darwin published on the origin of species more than two decades after cuvier 's death early in his tenure at the national museum in paris , cuvier published studies of fossil bones in which he argued that they belonged to large , extinct quadrupeds '' however , cuvier 's actual method was heavily dependent on the comparison of fossil specimens with the anatomy of extant species in the necessary context of his vast knowledge of animal anatomy and access to unparallelled natural history collections in paris this reality , however , did not prevent the rise of a popular legend that cuvier could reconstruct the entire bodily structures of extinct animals given only a few fragments of bone at the time cuvier presented his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants , it was still widely believed that no species of animal had ever become extinct this discovery led cuvier to denounce the idea that fossils came from those that are currently living ultimately , his repeated identification of fossils as belonging to species unknown to man , combined with mineralogical evidence from his stratigraphical studies in paris , drove cuvier to the proposition that the abrupt changes the earth underwent over a long period of time caused some species to go extinct cuvier 's thinking on extinctions was influenced by his extensive readings in greek and latin literature ; he gathered every ancient report known in his day relating to discoveries of petrified bones of remarkable size in the mediterranean region influence on cuvier 's theory of extinction was his collection of specimens from the new world , many of them obtained from native americans he also maintained an archive of native american observations , legends , and interpretations of immense fossilized skeletal remains , sent to him by informants and friends in the americas near the end of his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants , he said : : all of these facts , consistent among themselves , and not opposed by any report , seem to me to prove the existence of a world previous to ours , destroyed by some kind of catastrophe instead , he proposed that humans were around long enough to indirectly maintain the fossilized records of ancient earth though he found many accounts of the water catastrophe unclear , he did believe that such an event occurred at the brink of human history nonetheless this led cuvier to become an active proponent of the geological school of thought called catastrophism , which maintained that many of the geological features of the earth and the history of life could be explained by catastrophic events that had caused the extinction of many species of animals over the course of his career , cuvier came to believe there had not been a single catastrophe , but several , resulting in a succession of different faunas he wrote about these ideas many times , in particular he discussed them in great detail in the preliminary discourse ( an introduction ) to a collection of his papers , recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupèdes ( researches on quadruped fossil bones ) , on quadruped fossils published in 1812 cuvier 's own explanation for such a catastrophic event is derived from two different sources , including those from jean-andré deluc and déodat de dolomieu in fact , he believed that earth 's existence was limited and not as extended as many natural scientists , like lamarck , believed it to be much of the evidence he used to support his catastrophist theories have been taken from his fossil records cuvier did n't wish to delve much into the causation of all the extinction and introduction of new animal species but rather focused on the sequential aspects of animal history on earth the 'preliminary discourse ' became very well known and , unauthorized translations were made into english , german , and italian ( and in the case of those in english , not entirely accurately ) after cuvier 's death , the catastrophic school of geological thought lost ground to uniformitarianism , as championed by charles lyell and others , which claimed that the geological features of the earth were best explained by currently observable forces , such as erosion and volcanism , acting gradually over an extended period of time the increasing interest in the topic of mass extinction starting in the late twentieth century , however , has led to a resurgence of interest among historians of science and other scholars in this aspect of cuvier 's work along with william smith 's work during the same period on a geological map of england , which also used characteristic fossils and the principle of faunal succession to correlate layers of sedimentary rock , the monograph helped establish the scientific discipline of stratigraphy in 1800 and working only from a drawing , cuvier was the first to correctly identify in print , a fossil found in bavaria as a small flying reptile , which he named the ptero-dactyle in 1809 , ( later latinized as pterodactylus antiquus ) —the first known member of the diverse order of pterosaurs in a 1798 paper on the fossil remains of an animal found in some plaster quarries near paris , cuvier states what is known as the principle of the correlation of parts the strongest evidence cuvier could provide in favor of extinction would be to prove that the fossilized remains of an animal belonged to a species that no longer existed in addition to helping anatomists reconstruct fossilized remains , cuvier believed that his principle held enormous predictive power as well cuvier hoped that his principles of anatomy would provide the law-based framework that would elevate natural history to the truly scientific level occupied by physics and chemistry thanks to the laws established by isaac newton ( 1643 - 1727 ) and antoine lavoisier ( 1743 - 1794 ) , respectively see discussion in in the same 1798 paper on the fossil remains of an animal found in plaster quarries near paris , cuvier emphasizes the predictive power of his principle , writing , today comparative anatomy has reached such a point of perfection that , after inspecting a single bone , one can often determine the class , and sometimes even the genus of the animal to which it belonged , above all if that bone belonged to the head or the limbs this is because the number , direction , and shape of the bones that compose each part of an animal 's body are always in a necessary relation to all the other parts , in such a way that—up to a point—one can infer the whole from any one of them and vice versa though cuvier believed that his principle 's major contribution was that it was a rational , mathematical way to reconstruct fossils and make predictions , in reality it was difficult for cuvier to use his principle the functional significance of many body parts were still unknown at the time , and so relating those body parts to other body parts using cuvier 's principle was impossible in his anatomical studies , cuvier believed function played a bigger role than form in the field of taxonomy he also articulated that species can not move across these categories , a theory called transmutation cuvier began his intensive studies of mollusks during his time in normandy—the first time he had ever seen the sea—and his papers on the so-called mollusca began appearing as early as 1792 in palaeontology , cuvier published a long list of memoirs , partly relating to the bones of extinct animals , and partly detailing the results of observations on the skeletons of living animals , specially examined with a view toward throwing light upon the structure and affinities of the fossil forms in this classic work , cuvier presented the results of his life 's research into the structure of living and fossil animals with the exception of the section on insects , in which he was assisted by his friend latreille , the whole of the work was his own apart from his own original investigations in zoology and paleontology cuvier carried out a vast amount of work as perpetual secretary of the national institute , and as an official connected with public education generally ; and much of this work appeared ultimately in a published form
