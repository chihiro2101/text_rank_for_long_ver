carter 's and secretary of state cyrus vance 's exploratory meetings gave a basic plan for reinvigorating the peace process based on a geneva peace conference and had presented three main objectives for arab–israeli peace : arab recognition of israel 's right to exist in peace , israel 's withdrawal from occupied territories gained in the six-day war through negotiating efforts with neighboring arab nations to ensure that israel 's security would not be threatened and securing an undivided jerusalem the camp david accords were the result of 14 months of diplomatic efforts by egypt , israel , and the united states that began after jimmy carter became president 229–228 '' upon assuming office on 20 january 1977 , president carter moved to rejuvenate the middle east peace process that had stalled throughout the 1976 presidential campaign in the united states while begin , who took office in may 1977 , officially favored the reconvening of the conference , perhaps even more vocally than rabin , and even accepted the palestinian presence , in actuality the israelis and the egyptians were secretly formulating a framework for bilateral talks even earlier , begin had not been opposed to returning the sinai , but a major future obstacle was his firm refusal to consider relinquishing control over the west bank carter outlined to begin his program , which consisted of five points : ( 1 ) achieve a comprehensive peace affecting all of israel 's neighbors : ( 2 ) peace to be based on un resolution 242 : ( 3 ) peace would involve open borders and free trade ; ( 4 ) peace would call for israeli withdrawal from occupied territories to secure borders ; ( 5 ) a palestinian entity ( but not an independent nation ) should be created despite the fact that he supported sadat 's peace initiative , king hussein refused to take part in the peace talks ; begin offered jordan little to gain and hussein also feared he would isolate jordan from the arab world and provoke syria and the plo if he engaged in the peace talks as well hafez al-assad , who had no interest in negotiating peace with israel , the middle east : ten years after camp david , william b sadat first spoke about the possibility of peace with israel in february 1971 and egypt was the initiator of many moves in the 1970s ten days after his speech , sadat arrived for the groundbreaking three-day visit , which launched the first peace process between israel and an arab state as would be the case with later israeli–arab peace initiatives , washington was taken by surprise ; the white house and state department were particularly concerned that sadat was merely reaching out to reacquire sinai as quickly as possible , putting aside the palestinian problem the sadat visit came about after he delivered a speech in egypt stating that he would travel anywhere , '' even jerusalem , '' to discuss peace like sadat , begin also saw many reasons why bilateral talks would be in his country 's best interests in addition , the commencement of direct negotiations between leaders & nbsp ; – summit diplomacy & nbsp ; – would distinguish egypt from her arab neighbors a mechanism had yet to be created for israel and egypt to pursue the talks begun by sadat and begin in jerusalem the egyptian president suggested to begin that israel place a secret representative in the american embassy in cairo with american '' cover , '' the true identity of the israeli , who would liaise between the egyptian and israeli leaders , would be known only to the american ambassador in cairo within days israeli journalists were allowed into cairo , breaking a symbolic barrier , and from there the peace process quickly gained momentum carter 's advisers insisted on the establishment of an egyptian-israeli agreement which would lead to an eventual solution to the palestine issue however , carter felt they were not '' aiming high enough '' and was interested in the establishment of a written '' land for peace '' agreement with israel returning the sinai peninsula and west bank numerous times both the egyptian and israeli leaders wanted to scrap negotiations , only to be lured back into the process by personal appeals from carter in response , carter had the choice of trying to salvage the agreement by conceding the issue of the west bank to begin , while advocating sadat 's less controversial position on the removal of all settlements from the sinai peninsula the camp david accords comprise two separate agreements : '' a framework for peace in the middle east '' and '' a framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between egypt and israel '' , the second leading towards the egypt–israel peace treaty signed in march 1979 it was less clear than the agreements concerning the sinai , and was later interpreted differently by israel , egypt , and the united states the third part , '' associated principles , '' declared principles that should apply to relations between israel and all of its arab neighbors egypt , israel , jordan and the representatives of the palestinian people should participate in negotiations on the resolution of the palestinian problem in all its aspects ) egypt and israel agree that , in order to ensure a peaceful and orderly transfer of authority , and taking into account the security concerns of all the parties , there should be transitional arrangements for the west bank and gaza for a period not exceeding five years as soon as possible , but not later than the third year after the beginning of the transitional period , negotiations will take place to determine the final status of the west bank and gaza and its relationship with its neighbors and to conclude a peace treaty between israel and jordan by the end of the transitional period these negotiations will be conducted among egypt , israel , jordan and the elected representatives of the inhabitants of the west bank and gaza the un general assembly rejected the framework for peace in the middle east , because the agreement was concluded without participation of un and plo and did not comply with the palestinian right of return , of self-determination and to national independence and sovereignty the part of the camp david accords regarding the palestinian future and all similar ones were declared invalid the second framework jimmy carter library , framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between egypt and israel outlined a basis for the peace treaty six months later , in particular deciding the future of the sinai peninsula jordan 's king hussein saw it as a slap to the face when sadat volunteered jordan 's participation in deciding how functional autonomy for the palestinians would work specifically , sadat effectively said that jordan would have a role in how the west bank would be administered like the rabat summit resolution , the camp david accords circumscribed jordan 's objective to reassert its control over the west bank the camp david accords also prompted the disintegration of a united arab front in opposition to israel syria also informed egypt that it would not reconcile with the nation unless it abandoned the peace agreement with israel according to the continuum political encyclopedia of the middle east : the normalization of relations between israel and egypt went into effect in january 1980 sela , '' arab–israel conflict '' , 100 according to kenneth stein in heroic diplomacy : sadat , kissinger , carter , begin , and the quest for arab–israeli peace : the accords were another interim agreement or step , but negotiations that flowed from the accords slowed for several reasons these included an inability to bring the jordanians into the discussions ; the controversy over settlements ; the inconclusive nature of the subsequent autonomy talks ; domestic opposition sustained by both begin and sadat and , in sadat 's case , ostracism and anger from the arab world ; the emergence of a what became a cold peace between egypt and israel ; and changes in foreign policy priorities including discontinuity in personnel committed to sustaining the negotiating process armstrong , 414 in israel , there is lasting support of the camp david peace accords , which have become a national consensus , supported by 85 % of israelis according to a 2001 poll taken by the jaffee center for strategic studies ( israel-based ) ;
