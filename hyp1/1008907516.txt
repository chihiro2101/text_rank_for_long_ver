at that time , a system could store digitized speech on disk , play the appropriate spoken message , and process the human 's dtmf response ivr became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions with improvements in technology , systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use dtmf signaling other technologies include using text-to-speech ( tts ) to speak complex and dynamic information , such as e-mails , news reports or weather information an ivr can be deployed in several ways : equipment installed on the customer premises equipment installed in the pstn ( public switched telephone network ) application service provider ( asp ) / hosted ivr an automatic call distributor ( acd ) is often the first point of contact when calling many larger businesses an acd uses digital storage devices to play greetings or announcements , but typically routes a caller without prompting for input the ability to use xml-driven applications allows a web server to act as the application server , freeing the ivr developer to focus on the call flow mixed dialog prompts must also be able to recognize responses that are not relevant to the immediate prompt , for instance in the case of a user deciding to shift to a function different from the current one in telecommunications , an audio response unit ( aru ) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to dtmf keypresses by processing calls based on ( a ) the call-originator input , ( b ) information received from a database , and ( c ) information in the incoming call , such as the time of day when an ivr system answers multiple phone numbers , the use of dnis ensures that the correct application and language is executed a single large ivr system can handle calls for thousands of applications , each with its own phone numbers and script in a system wherein individual customers may have a different status , the service will automatically prioritize the individual 's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue ivrs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing , performance report , and future ivr system enhancements cti can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the ivr dialog from the ivr to the agent desktop using a screen pop , making for a more effective and efficient service although television and radio have made it easy to spread information in remote areas , farmers need community support to transform these messages into actionable advice in avaaj otalo , farmers could receive information by dialing a phone number and navigating through simple audio prompts due to the introduction of instant messaging ( im ) in contact centers , agents can handle up to 6 different im conversations at the same time , which increases agent productivity this has meant hosted ivr applications using speech are now available to smaller contact centers across the globe and has led to an expansion of asp ( application service providers ) it is also possible to deploy two-prong ivr services where the initial ivr application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center this can be used to balance loading across multiple contact centers or provide business continuity in the event of a system outage ivr has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller 's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system however , modern ivr systems are able to include caller context and provide personalized options companies have also been criticized for using ivr to reduce operational costs as the solution replaces the need for human agents to address voice inquiries additionally , as basic information is now available online , the calls coming into a call center are more likely to be complex problems and not ones that can be resolved in an automated fashion , thus requiring the attention of a live agent .
