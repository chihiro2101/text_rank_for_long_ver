the assembly process is driven by interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( also called the hydrophobic effect ) an increase in interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( causing clustering of hydrophobic regions ) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other , increasing the entropy of the system one common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane , which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration in some cases , this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation lipid asymmetry arises , at least in part , from the fact that most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer : those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases , which transfer lipids in the opposite direction , and scramblases , which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers ( as in apoptotic cells ) in any case , once lipid asymmetry is established , it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric , although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated is very different from that in cells at a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or a gel ( solid ) phase in both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer , but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second thus , at a given temperature , a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid if some of the components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase , the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions , rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean this phase separation plays a critical role in biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated one particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol , which modulates bilayer permeability , mechanical strength , and biochemical interactions unlike pc , some of the other headgroups carry a net charge , which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer it has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthesis capability being the production of more phospholipids lipid bilayers are also involved in signal transduction through their role as the home of integral membrane proteins in addition to protein- and solution-mediated processes , it is also possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling electrical measurements are a straightforward way to characterize an important function of a bilayer : its ability to segregate and prevent the flow of ions in solution by applying a voltage across the bilayer and measuring the resulting current , the resistance of the bilayer is determined resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers , much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer in conjunction with rapid freezing techniques , electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport , for instance in demonstrating that exocytosis vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses the analysis of 31 p-nmr spectra of lipids could provide a wide range of information about lipid bilayer packing , phase transitions ( gel phase , physiological liquid crystal phase , ripple phases , non bilayer phases ) , lipid head group orientation/dynamics , and elastic properties of pure lipid bilayer and as a result of binding of proteins and other biomolecules afm is a promising technique because it has the potential to image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer , conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior utilizing this capability , afm has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores ( holes ) and phase transitions in supported bilayers another advantage is that afm does not require fluorescent or isotope labeling of the lipids , since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface because of this , the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins , sometimes even with single-molecule resolution small uncharged apolar molecules diffuse through lipid bilayers many orders of magnitude faster than ions or water two special classes of protein deal with the ionic gradients found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer , but their roles are quite different in the previous example it was electrical bias , but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein in the reverse process , a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off , enclosing a portion of the extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function , but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other the primary mechanism of this interdependence is the large amount of lipid material involved if these two processes were not balancing each other , the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a short time electroporation is the rapid increase in bilayer permeability induced by the application of a large artificial electric field across the membrane it is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as dna , which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core this increase in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species , indicating that the mechanism is the creation of nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane in contrast , during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position , opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water k a and k b affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer , and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels bilayer mechanical properties also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing thus , the elastic modulus of the bilayer is primarily determined by how much extra area is exposed to water when the lipid molecules are stretched apart the origin of this energy is the fact that creating such an interface exposes some of the lipid tails to water , but the exact orientation of these border lipids is unknown fusion is the process by which two lipid bilayers merge , resulting in one connected structure one of the critical roles of calcium in the body is regulating membrane fusion the situation is further complicated when considering fusion in vivo since biological fusion is almost always regulated by the action of membrane protein it is believed that this phenomenon results from the lipid bilayer mechanics formed during electroporation , which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers in theory , liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug , can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity , surface charge density , and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system the most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol ( peg ) onto the liposome surface to produce “ stealth ” vesicles , which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing more recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type although the results of this experiment were accurate , fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer ” this was the first time the bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as organelle membranes around the same time , the development of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins by “ painting ” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture , mueller and rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity , high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture , all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane
