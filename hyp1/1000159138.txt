the expected payoff for both scenarios is 50 , meaning that an individual who was insensitive to risk would not care whether they took the guaranteed payment or the gamble a person is said to be : risk averse ( or risk avoiding ) - if they would accept a certain payment ( certainty equivalent ) of less than 50 ( for example , 40 ) , rather than taking the gamble and possibly receiving nothing risk loving ( or risk seeking ) – if they would accept the bet even when the guaranteed payment is more than 50 ( for example , 60 ) the smallest dollar amount that an individual would be indifferent to spending on a gamble or guarantee is called the certainty equivalent , which is also used as a measure of risk aversion using expected utility theory 's approach to risk aversion to analyze small stakes decisions has come under criticism rabin criticizes this implication of expected utility theory on grounds of implausibility—individuals who are risk averse for small gambles due to diminishing marginal utility would exhibit extreme forms of risk aversion in risky decisions under larger stakes one solution to the problem observed by rabin is that proposed by prospect theory and cumulative prospect theory , where outcomes are considered relative to a reference point ( usually the status quo ) , rather than considering only the final wealth the reflection effect is an identified pattern of opposite preferences between negative as opposed to positive prospects : people tend to avoid risk when the gamble is between gains , and to seek risks when the gamble is between losses this result coincides with other studies , that show that neuromodulation of the same area results in participants making more or less risk averse choices , depending on whether the modulation increases or decreases the activity of the target area this often means that they demand ( with the power of legal enforcement ) that risks be minimized , even at the cost of losing the utility of the risky activity it is important to consider the opportunity cost when mitigating a risk ; the cost of not taking the risky action they are expensive , meaning that less resources are available to benefit users in other ways ( such as building a playground closer to the child 's home , reducing the risk of a road traffic accident on the way to it ) , and—some argue—children may attempt more dangerous acts , with confidence in the artificial surface children need to have a certain amount of risk taking
