laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and university , industry , government , or military facilities , and even aboard ships and spacecraft despite the underlying notion of the lab as a confined space for experts , the term '' laboratory '' is also increasingly applied to workshop spaces such as living lab , fab lab , or hackerspaces , in which people meet to work on societal problems or make prototypes , working collaboratively or sharing resources one distinctive feature of work in open labs is phenomena of translation , driven by the different backgrounds and levels of expertise of the people involved for the purposes of research , teaching , or analysis ; ( also ) one in which chemicals or drugs are manufactured laboratory techniques are the set of procedures used on natural sciences such as chemistry , biology , physics to conduct an experiment , all of them follow the scientific method ; while some of them involve the use of complex laboratory equipment from laboratory glassware to electrical devices , and others require more specific or expensive supplies the title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories under this standard , a laboratory is required to produce a chemical hygiene plan ( chp ) which addresses the specific hazards found in its location , and its approach to them an important element of such audits is the review of regulatory compliance and the training of individuals who have access to or work in the laboratory scientists consider how their work should be organized , which could be based on themes , teams , projects or fields of expertise work is divided , not only between different jobs of the laboratory such as the researchers , engineers and technicians , but also in terms of autonomy ( should the work be individual or in groups ) it came about due to the observation that the quality of work of researchers who collaborate is overall greater than a researcher working in isolation from the 1950s , the laboratory has evolved from being an educational tool used by teachers to attract the top students into research , into an organizational model allowing a high level of scientific productivity there are three main factors that contribute to the organizational form of a laboratory : the educational background of the researchers and their socialization process the intellectual process involved in their work , including the type of investigation and equipment they use through ethnography studies , one finding is that , among the personnel , each class ( researchers , administrators as an example , administrators , in one lab of the study , do not have the right to ask the locator where the researchers currently are , as they are not entitled to such information on the other hand , researchers do have access to this type of information this was inferred based on the attitude of various jobs towards their lab badge
