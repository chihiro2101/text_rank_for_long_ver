radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard , generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation a number of manufacturers and retailers sell radio clocks that receive coded time signals from a radio station , which , in turn , derives the time from a true atomic clock these use signals transmitted by the appropriate transmitter for the country in which they are to be used digital television systems can equal gps stratum 2 accuracy ( with short term clock discipline ) and stratum 1 ( with long term clock discipline ) provided the transmitter site ( or network ) supports that level of functionality analog radio clock in 201704.jpg a low frequency ( lf ) radio clock low cost dcf77 receiver.jpg lf time signal receiver junghans mega.jpg world 's first radio clock wrist watch , junghans mega ( analog model ) citizen attesa eco-drive atv53-3023 01.jpg citizen attesa eco-drive atv53-3023 analog-digital chronograph with 4 area radio controlled reception ( north america , europe , china , japan ) file : funkuhr.jpg radio controlled analog wall clock file : dcf77 controlled alarmclock.jpg radio controlled alarm clock file : bahnsteiguhr.jpg the dcf77 time signal is used by organizations like the deutsche bahn railway company to synchronize their station clocks a radio clock receiver may combine multiple time sources to improve its accuracy the recent revival and enhancement of loran , a land-based radio navigation system , will provide another multiple source time distribution system many modern radio clocks use the global positioning system to provide more accurate time than can be obtained from terrestrial radio stations these gps clocks combine time estimates from multiple satellite atomic clocks with error estimates maintained by a network of ground stations gps units intended primarily for time measurement as opposed to navigation can be set to assume the antenna position is fixed gps clocks provide the precise time needed for synchrophasor measurement of voltage and current on the commercial power grid to determine the health of the system although any satellite navigation receiver that is performing its primary navigational function must have an internal time reference accurate to a small fraction of a second , the displayed time is often not as precise as the internal clock various of the formats above include a flag indicating the status of daylight saving time ( dst ) in the home country of the transmitter casio wave ceptor clock network speaking clock time from npl time transfer time synchronization in north america
