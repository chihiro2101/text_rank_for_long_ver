monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis , triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells , pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site this role is important in chronic inflammation , as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils , which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age ( see cd31 for a description of this process ) when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils the removal of dying cells is , to a greater extent , handled by fixed macrophages , which will stay at strategic locations such as the lungs , liver , neural tissue , bone , spleen and connective tissue , ingesting foreign materials such as pathogens and recruiting additional macrophages if needed along with dendritic cells , they are foremost among the cells that present antigens , a crucial role in initiating an immune response as secretory cells , monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation ; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ( monokines ) including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin-1 the presentation is done by integrating it into the cell membrane and displaying it attached to an mhc class ii molecule ( mhcii ) , indicating to other white blood cells that the macrophage is not a pathogen , despite having antigens on its surface t cells that express the t cell receptor which recognizes the antigen-mhcii complex ( with co-stimulatory factors- cd40 and cd40l ) cause the b-cell to produce antibodies that help opsonisation of the antigen so that the bacteria can be better cleared by phagocytes macrophages provide yet another line of defense against tumor cells and somatic cells infected with fungus or parasites once a t cell has recognized its particular antigen on the surface of an aberrant cell , the t cell becomes an activated effector cell , producing chemical mediators known as lymphokines that stimulate macrophages into a more aggressive form in contrast , the m2 '' repair '' designation ( also referred to as alternatively activated macrophages ) broadly refers to macrophages that function in constructive processes like wound healing and tissue repair , and those that turn off damaging immune system activation by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines like il-10 m1 macrophages are the dominating phenotype observed in the early stages of inflammation and are activated by four key mediators : interferon-γ ( ifn-γ ) , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) , and damage associated molecular patterns ( damps ) the first step to understanding the importance of macrophages in muscle repair , growth , and regeneration is that there are two '' waves '' of macrophages with the onset of damageable muscle use & nbsp ; – subpopulations that do and do not directly have an influence on repairing muscle the initial wave is a phagocytic population that comes along during periods of increased muscle use that are sufficient to cause muscle membrane lysis and membrane inflammation , which can enter and degrade the contents of injured muscle fibers it is thought that macrophages release soluble substances that influence the proliferation , differentiation , growth , repair , and regeneration of muscle , but at this time the factor that is produced to mediate these effects is unknown it is known that macrophages ' involvement in promoting tissue repair is not muscle specific ; they accumulate in numerous tissues during the healing process phase following injury the macrophage 's main role is to phagocytize bacteria and damaged tissue , and they also debride damaged tissue by releasing proteases macrophages are stimulated by the low oxygen content of their surroundings to produce factors that induce and speed angiogenesis and they also stimulate cells that re-epithelialize the wound , create granulation tissue , and lay down a new extracellular matrix these resident macrophages are sessile ( non-migratory ) , provide essential growth factors to support the physiological function of the tissue ( e.g due to their role in phagocytosis , macrophages are involved in many diseases of the immune system for example , they participate in the formation of granulomas , inflammatory lesions that may be caused by a large number of diseases some disorders , mostly rare , of ineffective phagocytosis and macrophage function have been described , for example adenovirus ( most common cause of pink eye ) can remain latent in a host macrophage , with continued viral shedding 6–18 months after initial infection like t cells , macrophages can be infected with hiv , and even become a reservoir of ongoing virus replication throughout the body macrophages are better able to resist infection by hiv-1 than cd4+ t cells , although susceptibility to hiv infection differs among macrophage subtypes nf-κb then enters the nucleus of a tumor cell and turns on production of proteins that stop apoptosis and promote cell proliferation and inflammation some tumors can also produce factors , including m-csf/csf1 , ccl2 and angiotensin ii , that trigger the amplification and mobilization of macrophages in tumors for example , macrophages may have cytotoxic activity to kill tumor cells directly ; also the co-operation of t-cells and macrophages is important to suppress tumors recent study findings suggest that by forcing ifn-α expression in tumor-infiltrating macrophages , it is possible to blunt their innate protumoral activity and reprogram the tumor microenvironment toward more effective dendritic cell activation and immune effector cell cytotoxicity additionally , subcapsular sinus macrophages in tumor-draining lymph nodes can suppress cancer progression by containing the spread of tumor-derived materials macrophages can be protective in different ways : they can remove dead tumor cells ( in a process called phagocytosis ) following treatments that kill these cells ; they can serve as drug depots for some anticancer drugs ; they can also be activated by some therapies to promote antitumor immunity because macrophages can regulate tumor progression , therapeutic strategies to reduce the number of these cells , or to manipulate their phenotypes , are currently being tested in cancer patients it has been observed that increased number of pro-inflammatory macrophages within obese adipose tissue contributes to obesity complications including insulin resistance and diabetes type 2 within the fat ( adipose ) tissue of ccr2 deficient mice , there is an increased number of eosinophils , greater alternative macrophage activation , and a propensity towards type 2 cytokine expression in an obese individual some adipocytes burst and undergo necrotic death , which causes the residential m2 macrophages to switch to m1 phenotype though very similar in structure to tissue macrophages , intestinal macrophages have evolved specific characteristics and functions given their natural environment , which is in the digestive tract to prevent the destruction of the gut bacteria , intestinal macrophages have developed key differences compared to other macrophages this change is directly caused by the intestinal macrophages environment there has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages
