alternatively , turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage another way is to cover the ground with sand , or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material , to a depth of a few inches fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire flying embers are still a threat , and the fire ring may become hot enough to ignite material in contact with it , or the heat the water to a vapor thereby cracking the rocks as such , it is important for the fire builder to take multiple safety precautions , including : avoiding building campfires under hanging branches or over steep slopes , and clear a ten-foot diameter circle around the fire of all flammable debris a faggot is a related term indicating a bundle of small branches used to feed a small fire or continue developing a bigger fire out of a small one in heavily used campsites , fuel wood can be hard to find , so it may have to purchased at a nearby store or be brought from home with the proliferation of packaged food , it is quite likely that plastics will be incinerated as well , a practice that not only produces toxic smoke but will also leave polluted ashes behind because of incomplete combustion at too-low open fire temperatures however , these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware a hybrid fire combines the elements of both the tipi and the log cabin creating an easily lit yet stable fire structure this fire structure combines benefits of both fire types : the tipi allows the fire to ignite easily and the log cabin sustains the fire for a long time once the fire is burning well , additional pieces of wood are placed on top in layers that alternate directions the traditional finland rakovalkea , or nying in scandinavian languages , also called by english terms long log fire or gap fire , is constructed by placing one long and thick piece of fuelwood ( log ) atop another , parallel , and bolstering them in place with four sturdy posts driven into the ground a well constructed rakovalkea of two thick logs of two meters in length can warm two lean-to shelters for a whole sleeping shift this fire is unique because it uses only one piece of fair-sized wood as its fuel the large round area is used to build a fire to create coals first , the layers of fuelwood take in the heat from the initial tinder/kindling , therefore , it is not lost to the surrounding ground and secondly , this fire type requires minimal labor , thereby making it ideal as a fire of choice before bedding down for the evening without having to get up periodically to add fuelwood and/or stoke the fire to keep it going once enough wood is piled , there should be a decent '' platform '' to make the tipi tinder/kindling to initiate the fire dakota smokeless pit fire is a tactical fire used by the united states military as the flame produces a low light signature , reduced smoke , and is easier to ignite under strong wind conditions two small holes are dug in the ground : one vertical for the firewood and the other slanted to the bottom of the first hole to provide a draft of air for nearly complete combustion optional are flat stones to partially cover the first hole and provide support for cookery , and a tree over the pits to disperse the smoke once the fire is built , the tinder is lighted , using one of several methods smoking black powder produced by friction between a stick , or bow drill , or pump drill and a hole or crack on dry wood , a magnifying glass focusing sunlight , smoking material produced by a fire piston , smoking black powder produced by a bamboo fire saw smoking material produced by a fire roll ( small amount of cotton mixed with ash or iron rust , rolled vigorously between two flat stones or planks , until it starts smoking ) , smoking material produced by a piece of flint or ferro-rod struck against steel over amadou or other initial tinder , or an combustion , such as a match or a lighter one of five problems can prevent a fire from lighting properly : wet wood , wet weather , too little tinder , too much wind , or a lack of oxygen metal fire rings generally do a good job of keeping out wind , but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire to make matters worse , these tall fire rings also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly a small , enclosed fire that has slowed down may require vigorous blowing to get it going again , but excess blowing can extinguish a fire once large kindling is burning , all kindling is placed in the fire , then the fuel wood is placed on top of it ( unless , as in the rakovalkea fire-build , it is already there ) possibly the simplest method of cooking over a campfire and one of the most common is to roast food on long skewers that can be held above red glowing embers , or on the side near the flames ( not over flames in order to avoid sot and burnt food ) a campfire may burn out of control in two basic ways : on the ground or in the trees if a root , particularly a dead one , is exposed to fire , it may smoulder underground and ignite the parent tree long after the original fire is doused and the campers have left the area this latter threat is less likely , but a fire in a branch is extremely difficult to put out without firefighting equipment , and may spread more quickly than a ground fire public areas with large tracts of woodland usually have signs that indicate the fire danger level , which usually depends on recent rain and the amount of deadfall or dry debris it is often possible to restart the new day 's fire using the embers water is continuously poured until the hissing stops , then the ashes are stirred to ensure that water reaches the entire fire , and more water is added if necessary in lightly used wilderness areas , the area around the campfire is cleaned up to make it look untouched after the fire is extinguished wood and cardboard are used as tinder file : scoutcampfire.jpg a campfire that seems to produce sparks , due to a long exposure when
