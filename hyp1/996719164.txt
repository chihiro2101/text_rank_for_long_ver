amstrad 's founder alan sugar realised that most computers in the united kingdom were used for word processing at home , and allegedly sketched an outline design for a low cost replacement for typewriters during a flight to the far east '' at its united kingdom launch in september 1985 , the basic pcw model was priced at £399 plus value added tax , which included a printer , word processor program , the cp/m operating system and associated utilities , and a basic interpreter software vendors quickly made a wide range of additional applications available , including accounting , spreadsheet and database programs , so that the system was able to support most of the requirements of a home or small business shortly afterwards the tandy 1000 was introduced in the uk with the ms-dos operating system and a similar suite of business applications and became the only other ibm-compatible personal computer system available for less than £1,000 in britain although competitors ' systems generally had more sophisticated features , including colour monitors , whitehead thought the amstrad pcw offered the best value for money in the us the pcw was launched at a price of 799 , and its competitors were initially the magnavox videowriter and smith corona pwp , two word-processing systems whose prices also included a screen , keyboard and printer the magazine popular science thought that the pcw could not compete as a general-purpose computer , because its use of non-standard 3-inch floppy disk drives and the rather old cp/m operating system would restrict the range of software available from expanding beyond the spreadsheet , typing tutor and cheque book balancing programs already on sale however , the magazine predicted that the pcw 's large screen and easy-to-use word processing software would make it a formidable competitor for dedicated word processors in the home and business markets the daily telegraph estimated in 2000 that 100,000 were still in use in the uk , and said that the reliability of the pcw 's hardware and software and the range of independently produced add-on software for its word processing program were factors in its continued popularity however , after adjustment for inflation the retail price of a multimedia ibm-compatible pc in 1997 was about 11 % more than that of a pcw 8256 in 1985 , and many home pcs were cast-offs , sometimes costing as little as £50 , from large organisations that had upgraded their systems the monitor could also display graphics well enough for the bundled graphics program and for some games there are several techniques for transferring data from a pcw to an ibm-compatible pc , some of which also can transfer in the opposite direction , and service companies that will do the job for a fee users of single-sided drives had to flip the disks over to use the full capacity this unit could print 90 & nbsp ; characters per second at draft quality and 20 & nbsp ; characters per second at higher quality , and could also produce graphics users who needed to support higher print volumes or to produce graphics could buy a daisy wheel printer or plotter from amstrad the keyboard had 82 keys , some of which were designed for word processing , especially with the bundled locoscript software – for example to cut , copy , and paste the 9512 was also supplied with version 2 of the locoscript word processor program which included spellchecker and mail merge facilities by this time other systems offered much better print quality , and the pcw was a poor choice as a general-purpose computer , because of its slow cpu and incompatibility with ms-dos systems the bundled word processor was produced by creative technology , and could read locoscript files but saved them in its own format amstrad never provided other applications , and very little third-party software was written for the machine in the magazine pcw plus dave langford expressed a series of concerns about the pcw16 : the operating system could not run the many cp/m programs available for previous pcw models ; the flash ram was too small for a large collection of programs , but programs could not be run from the floppy disk , which was designed for backing up files ; and a second-hand ibm pc with locoscript pro looked like a more sensible upgrade path for users of earlier pcws version 2 , which was bundled with the pcw 9512 , included a spellchecker and could provide mail merge by interfacing to other products from locomotive software , such as locomail and locofile the rest of the ram was used as a ram disk ( exposed under the drive letter '' m : '' for '' memory '' ) , which was much faster than a floppy disk but lost all its data when the machine was powered off this version of basic lacked built-in graphics facilities , but included jetsam , an implementation of isam that supported multiple indexes per file , so that programs could access records directly by specifying values of key fields many software vendors supplied versions of their products to run with cp/m plus , making a wide range of software available for the pcw , often very cheaply : alternative word processors included superwriter and wordstar programs that were already configured for the pcw covered a broad range of requirements including word processors , databases , graphics , personal accounts , programming languages , games , utilities and a full-featured bulletin board system software could work round this by bank switching , accessing different banks of memory at different times but this made programming more complex and slowed the system down instead , at startup , the asic ( customised circuit ) at the heart of the pcw provided access to part of the 1k rom within the intel mcs-48 used to drive the printer to make the printer cheap enough to be included with every pcw , amstrad placed the majority of its drive electronics inside the pcw cabinet some of the later models included a built-in parallel port ; these could be bundled with either the dedicated amstrad printer or a canon bubblejet model the machines were built around the 8-bit zilog z80 processor , running at 4 & nbsp ; mhz , and managed the relatively large amount of ram main memory using a technique known as bank switching ( allowing access to more than the z80 's normal 16-bit address bus reach of 64 & nbsp ; kb ) in cp/m , the memory used for the display was switched out while programs were running , giving more than 60 & nbsp ; kb of usable ram the video system also fetched data in a special order designed so that plotting a character eight scan lines high would touch eight contiguous addresses
