soyuz : the greatest spacecraft ever the best ride in the galaxy â€“ coming back to earth in a soyuz soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from salyut and later mir soviet space stations , and are now used for transport to and from the international space station ( iss ) at least one soyuz spacecraft is docked to iss at all times for use as an escape craft in the event of an emergency a soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts ( from front to back ) : a spheroid orbital module , which provides accommodation for the crew during their mission ; a small aerodynamic reentry module , which returns the crew to earth ; a cylindrical service module with solar panels attached , which contains the instruments and engines this allows smaller rockets to launch the spacecraft or can be used to increase the habitable space available to the crew in apollo cm vs in soyuz ) in the mass budget a new soyuz spacecraft must be made for every mission the spacecraft abort system ( sas ; could also be manually activated from the ground , but unlike american spacecraft , there was no way for the cosmonauts to trigger it themselves since it turned out to be almost impossible to separate the entire payload shroud from the soyuz service module cleanly , the decision was made to have the shroud split between the service module and descent module during an abort on the latest soyuz versions ( since soyuz tm ) , a small window was introduced , providing the crew with a forward view also the rescue of the crew whilst on the launch pad or with the sas system is complicated because of the orbital module separation of the orbital module is critical for a safe landing ; without separation of the orbital module , it is not possible for the crew to survive landing in the descent module however , after the problematic landing of soyuz tm-5 in september 1988 this procedure was changed and the orbital module is now separated after the return maneuver this change was made as the tm-5 crew could not deorbit for 24 hours after they jettisoned their orbital module , which contained their sanitation facilities and the docking collar needed to attach to mir the descent module , also known as a reentry capsule , is used for launch and the journey back to earth the small dimensions of the descent module led to it having only two-man crews after the death of the soyuz 11 crew a non-pressurized part of the service module ( propulsion compartment , contains the main engine and a liquid-fuelled propulsion system for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to earth the soyuz uses a method similar to the united states apollo command and service module to deorbit itself early soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously from the descent module soyuz 1 through soyuz 11 ( 1967 & ndash ; 1971 ) were first-generation vehicles , carrying a crew of up to three without spacesuits and distinguished from those following by their bent solar panels and their use of the igla automatic docking navigation system , which required special radar antennas the soyuz 7k-l1 was designed to launch a crew from the earth to circle the moon , and was the primary hope for a soviet circumlunar flight thumb the third generation soyuz-t ( t : spacecraft ( 1976 & ndash ; 1986 ) featured solar panels allowing longer missions , a revised igla rendezvous system and new translation/attitude thruster system on the service module thumb the soyuz-tm crew transports ( m : were fourth generation soyuz spacecraft , and were used from 1986 to 2003 for ferry flights to mir and the international space station ( iss ) image : soyuz tma-6 spacecraft.jpg thumb 290px the soyuz tma-6 soyuz tma ( a : features several changes to accommodate requirements requested by nasa in order to service the international space station ( iss ) , including more latitude in the height and weight of the crew and improved parachute systems the soyuz tma-08m mission set a new record for the fastest crewed docking with a space station the mission used a new six-hour rendezvous , faster than the previous soyuz launches , which had , since 1986 , taken two days name '' soyuzms2017 '' > major changes include : more efficient solar panels modified docking and attitude control engine positions for redundancy during docking and de-orbit burns new kurs na approach and docking system which weighs half as much and consumes a third of the power of previous system new tsvm-101 computer , about one eighth the weight ( 8.3 kg versus 70 kg ) and much smaller than the previous argon-16 computer unified digital command/telemetry system ( mbits ) to relay telemetry via satellite , and control spacecraft when out of sight of ground stations ; also provides the crew with position data when out of ground tracking range glonass/gps and cospas-sarsat satellite systems for more accurate location during search/rescue operations after landing the uncrewed progress spacecraft are derived from soyuz and are used for servicing space stations
