similarly , functionalists argue , mental states can be explained without considering the states of the underlying physical medium ( such as the brain ) that realizes them ; one need only consider higher-level functions a silicon-based machine could have the same sort of mental life that a human being has , provided that its structure realized the proper functional roles thus , unlike standard versions of functionalism ( often called functional state identity theories ) , fsts do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states , because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential what often drives this view is the belief that if we were to encounter an alien race with a cognitive system composed of significantly different material from humans ' ( e.g , silicon-based ) but performed the same functions as human mental states ( for example , they tend to yell '' ouch ! '' when poked with sharp objects ) , we would say that their type of mental state might be similar to ours but it is the same arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do , and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind the essential point to consider here is the nature of the states of the turing machine according to machine-state functionalism , the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the turing machine states described above therefore , it is not a particular physical-chemical composition responsible for the particular machine or mental state , it is the programming rules which produce the effects that are responsible to put it another way , any rational preference is due to the rules being followed , not to the specific material composition of the agent in an analogous manner , the role of mental states , such as belief and desire , is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best scientific psychological theory hysteria ) is determined not to have any fundamental role in cognitive psychological explanation , then that particular state may be considered not to exist on the other hand , if it turns out that there are states which theoretical cognitive psychology posits as necessary for explanation of human behavior but which are not foreseen by ordinary folk psychological language , then these entities or states exist such terms are subject to conceptual analyses which take something like the following form : : mental state m is the state that is preconceived by p and causes q in attempting to overcome the conceptual difficulties that arose from the idea of a nation full of chinese people wired together , each person working as a single neuron to produce in the wired-together whole the functional mental states of an individual mind , many functionalists simply bit the bullet , so to speak , and argued that such a chinese nation would indeed possess all of the qualitative and intentional properties of a mind ; i.e whatever the worth of this latter hypothesis , it was immediately objected that it entailed an unacceptable sort of mind-mind supervenience : the systemic mind which somehow emerged at the higher-level must necessarily supervene on the individual minds of each individual member of the chinese nation , to stick to block 's formulation but this would seem to put into serious doubt , if not directly contradict , the fundamental idea of the supervenience thesis : there can be no change in the mental realm without some change in the underlying physical substratum given the transitivity of supervenience , if m1 supervenes on m2 , and m2 supervenes on p ( physical base ) , then m1 and m2 both supervene on p , even though they are ( allegedly ) totally different sets of mental facts since mind-mind supervenience seemed to have become acceptable in functionalist circles , it seemed to some that the only way to resolve the puzzle was to postulate the existence of an entire hierarchical series of mind levels ( analogous to homunculi ) which became less and less sophisticated in terms of functional organization and physical composition all the way down to the level of the physico-mechanical neuron or group of neurons the homunculi at each level , on this view , have authentic mental properties but become simpler and less intelligent as one works one 's way down the hierarchy that is , instead of mental states receiving a purely functional explanation in terms of their relations to other mental states , like those listed above , functions are seen as playing only a part—the other part being played by structures— of the explanation of a given mental state on this account the mind remains a functional system , but one that is understood in mechanistic terms functions are individuated and explained either in terms of the contributions they make to the given system or in teleological terms this is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states ( mental states ) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms that is , functionalism is not so much concerned with what there is than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state , e.g previous attempts to answer the mind-body problem have all tried to resolve it by answering both questions : dualism says there are two substances and that mental states are characterized by their immateriality ; behaviorism claimed that there was one substance and that mental states were behavioral disposition ; physicalism asserted the existence of just one substance and characterized the mental states as physical states ( as in '' pain c-fiber firings '' ) hence , they are physicalists , even though the general thesis of functionalism itself does not commit them to being so pain , for lewis , stands for something like the definite description '' the state with the causal role x '' according to functionalism , so long as the people are performing the proper functional roles , with the proper causal relations between inputs and outputs , the system will be a real mind , with mental states , consciousness , and so on indeed , it may be the case that we are constrained by our theory of mind pdf the thought experiment asserts that it is possible to mimic intelligent action without any interpretation or understanding through the use of a purely functional system according to searle , it would be absurd to claim that the english speaker inside knows chinese simply based on these syntactic processes thus , searle attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules ; that is , functionalism is an insufficient theory of the mind in connection with block 's chinese nation , many functionalists responded to searle 's thought experiment by suggesting that there was a form of mental activity going on at a higher level than the man in the chinese room could comprehend ( the so-called '' system reply '' ) ; that is , the system does know chinese furthermore , searle suggests the man in the room could simply memorize the rules and symbol relations again , though he would convincingly mimic communication , he would be aware only of the symbols and rules , not of the meaning behind them this thought experiment involves supposing that there is a person , call her jane , that is born with a condition which makes her see the opposite spectrum of light that is normally perceived in fact , one can see that all of your behavioral as well as functional relations to colors will be the same jane will , for example , properly obey traffic signs just as any other person would , even though this involves the color perception therefore , the argument goes , since there can be two people who are functionally identical , yet have different mental states ( differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects ) , functionalism is not robust enough to explain individual differences in qualia that even though mental content can not be fully accounted for in functional terms , there is nevertheless a nomological correlation between mental states and functional states in this world the general idea is that since it would be very unlikely for a conscious human being to experience a change in its qualia which it utterly fails to notice , mental content and functional profile appear to be inextricably bound together , at least in the human case this , coupled with the independent assertion that a conscious being 's functional profile just could be maintained , irrespective of its experiential state , leads to the conclusion that the subject of these experiments would remain fully conscious ( pdf online is responsible for one of the main arguments used against functionalism , although it was originally intended as an argument against semantic internalism therefore , so the argument goes , since two people can be functionally identical , yet have different mental states , functionalism can not sufficiently account for all mental states the internal contents of propositional attitudes , for example , would consist exclusively in those aspects of them which have no relation with the external world and which bear the necessary functional/causal properties that allow for relations with other internal mental states since no one has yet been able to formulate a clear basis or justification for the existence of such a distinction in mental contents , however , this idea has generally been abandoned in favor of externalist causal theories of mental contents ( also known as informational semantics ) further , this basic assumption is directly antithetical to functionalism ; and , thereby , the twin earth argument does not constitute a genuine argument : as this assumption entails a flat denial of functionalism itself ( which would say that the two waters would not produce different mental states , because the functional relationships would remain unchanged ) but since these outputs are , according to functionalism , related to many ( if not all ) internal mental states , two people who experience the same pain and react with different outputs must share little ( perhaps nothing ) in common in any of their mental states these arguments typically use the assumption that physics leads to a progression of unique states , and that functionalist realization is present whenever there is a mapping from the proposed set of mental states to physical states of the system given that the states of a physical system are always at least slightly unique , such a mapping will always exist , so any system is a mind however , since the system will be in unique states at each moment and at each possible input , such a mapping will always exist so there will be a transducer layer which will produce whatever physical behavior is desired godfrey-smith believes that these problems can be addressed using causality , but that it may be necessary to posit a continuum between objects being minds and not being minds rather than an absolute distinction
