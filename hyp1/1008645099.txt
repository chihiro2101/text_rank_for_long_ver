in 1408 english forces under the command of the future henry v placed harlech and its commander , edmund mortimer , under siege , conducting a bombardment with cannon , probably destroying the south and east parts of the outer walls thanks to its natural defences and the supply route by sea , harlech held out and as other fortresses fell , eventually became the last major stronghold still under lancastrian control the castle was the last mainland royal fortress to surrender in the war , and the date marked the end of the first phase of the war harlech was declared part of the castles and town walls of king edward in gwynedd world heritage site in 1986 , unesco considering harlech one of '' the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in europe '' harlech castle rests upon part of the rhinogydd , a spur of rock almost high ; the land falls away sharply on the north and west , and a ditch cut into the rock protects the remaining approaches to the castle the main entrance to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse ; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge the gatehouse follows the design , sometimes termed the tonbridge-style , that became popular during the 13th century , with two massive '' d-shaped '' defensive towers flanking the entrance ; the passage into the castle was guarded by three portcullises and at least two heavy doors the battlements may originally have been built with triple finials in a similar fashion to conwy , although little remains of these in the modern era the links between the harlech and savoy are not straightforward , however , as in some cases the relevant savoy structures were built after james had left the region
