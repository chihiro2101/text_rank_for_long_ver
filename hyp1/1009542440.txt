it is one of the largest wetlands along the gulf coast of north america the industrial canal connects the mississippi river with the lake at new orleans the lake was created 2,600 to 4,000 years ago as the evolving mississippi river delta formed its southern and eastern shorelines with alluvial deposits one recorded indigenous name for the lake is ( 'wide water ' ) in 1852 a railroad was constructed to link new orleans to the north water , earth , fire : louisiana ’ s natural heritage the future of the lake depends , in part , on restoring annual spring floods to the wetlands of the lake basin , and controlling urban sprawl on the north shore the lake could change considerably without such conservation planning 21 hence , the ecosystems of the lake now , and in the future , depend very much upon some basic decisions about human activities in the vicinity of the lake , and , even more so , human activity upstream along the mississippi river lake pontchartrain 's south shore areas ( dominated by new orleans ) , instead of being designated by that name , are more likely to be referred to as either '' east bank '' or '' west bank , '' depending upon their position with respect to the general north–south course of the mississippi river the lake provides numerous recreational activities for people in new orleans and is also home to the southern yacht club in the 1920s , the industrial canal in the eastern part of the city opened , providing a direct navigable water connection , with locks , between the mississippi river and the lake in the same decade , a project dredging new land from the lake shore behind a new concrete floodwall began ; this would result in an expansion of the city into the former swamp between metairie/gentilly ridges and the lakefront image : lake pontchartrain georges.jpg thumb upright 1.25 lake pontchartrain at new orleans during hurricane georges in 1998 ; lakefront fishing camps outside of the protection levee suffered severe damage wind pushes water into the lake from the gulf of mexico as a hurricane approaches from the south , and from there it can spill into new orleans a hurricane in 1947 flooded much of metairie , much of which is slightly below sea level due to land subsidence after marshland was drained after the storm , hurricane-protection levees were built along lake pontchartrain 's south shore to protect new orleans and nearby communities experts using computer modeling at louisiana state university after hurricane katrina have concluded that the levees were never topped but rather faulty design , inadequate construction , or some combination of the two were responsible for the flooding of most of new orleans although katrina weakened to a category 3 before making landfall on august 29 ( with only category 1-2 strength winds in new orleans on the weaker side of the eye of the hurricane ) , the outlying new orleans east area along south lake pontchartrain was in the eyewall with winds , preceding the eye , nearly as strong as those experienced in bay st canals near chalmette began leaking at 8 am , and some levees/canals , designed to withstand category 3 storms , suffered multiple breaks the following day ( see effects of hurricane katrina in new orleans ) , flooding 80 % of the city the walls of the industrial canal were breached by storm surge via the mississippi river gulf outlet , while the 17th street canal and london avenue canal experienced catastrophic breaches , even though water levels never topped their flood walls in this area , flooding was not the result of levee overtopping , but was due to a decision by the governmental administration of jefferson parish to abandon the levee-aligned drainage pumping stations on september 6 , the corps began pumping flood water back into the lake after seven days in the streets of new orleans aerial photography suggests that of water covered new orleans as of september 2 , which equals about 2 % of lake pontchartrain 's volume due to a lack of electric power , the city was unable to treat the water before pumping it into the lake on september 24 , 2005 , hurricane rita did not breach the temporary repairs in the main part of the city , but the repair on the industrial canal wall in the lower 9th ward was breached , allowing about of water back into that neighborhood
