although beta blockers were once contraindicated in congestive heart failure , as they have the potential to worsen the condition due to their effect of decreasing cardiac contractility , studies in the late 1990s showed their efficacy at reducing morbidity and mortality bisoprolol , carvedilol , and sustained-release metoprolol are specifically indicated as adjuncts to standard ace inhibitor and diuretic therapy in congestive heart failure , although at doses typically much lower than those indicated for other conditions beta-blockers , in addition to their sympatholytic β1 activity in the heart , influence the renin–angiotensin system at the kidneys heart failure characteristically involves increased catecholamine activity on the heart , which is responsible for several deleterious effects , including increased oxygen demand , propagation of inflammatory mediators , and abnormal cardiac tissue remodeling , all of which decrease the efficiency of cardiac contraction and contribute to the low ejection fraction the heart of the patient must adjust to decreasing stimulation by catecholamines and find a new equilibrium at a lower adrenergic drive the use of beta blockers around the time of cardiac surgery decreases the risk of heart dysrhythmias due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier , lipophilic beta blockers , such as propranolol and metoprolol , are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances , such as insomnia , vivid dreams and nightmares adverse effects associated with β 2 -adrenergic receptor antagonist activity ( bronchospasm , peripheral vasoconstriction , alteration of glucose and lipid metabolism ) are less common with β 1 -selective ( often termed '' cardioselective '' ) agents , but receptor selectivity diminishes at higher doses beta blockers must not be used in the treatment of selective alpha-adrenergic agonist overdose the blockade of only beta receptors increases hypertension , reduces coronary blood flow , left ventricular function , and cardiac output and tissue perfusion by means of leaving the alpha-adrenergic system stimulation unopposed the mixed alpha- and beta blocker labetalol is especially useful for treatment of concomitant tachycardia and hypertension induced by methamphetamine the phenomenon of '' unopposed alpha stimulation '' has not been reported with the use of beta blockers for treatment of methamphetamine toxicity cardioselective beta-blocker ( β1 blockers ) , if really required , can be prescribed at the least possible dose to those with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms glucagon , used in the treatment of overdose , increases the strength of heart contractions , increases intracellular camp , and decreases renal vascular resistance people experiencing bronchospasm due to the β 2 receptor-blocking effects of nonselective beta blockers may be treated with anticholinergic drugs , such as ipratropium , which are safer than beta agonists in patients with cardiovascular disease beta blockers inhibit these normal epinephrine- and norepinephrine-mediated sympathetic actions , but have minimal effect on resting subjects since β 2 adrenergic receptors can cause vascular smooth muscle dilation , beta blockers may cause some vasoconstriction the primary antihypertensive mechanism of beta blockers is unclear , but may involve reduction in cardiac output ( due to negative chronotropic and inotropic effects ) it may also be due to reduction in renin release from the kidneys , and a central nervous system effect to reduce sympathetic activity ( for those beta blockers that do cross the blood–brain barrier , e.g blockade of the sympathetic nervous system on renin release leads to reduced aldosterone via the renin–angiotensin system , with a resultant decrease in blood pressure due to decreased sodium and water retention also referred to as intrinsic sympathomimetic effect , this term is used particularly with beta-blockers that can show both agonism and antagonism at a given beta receptor , depending on the concentration of the agent ( beta-blocker ) and the concentration of the antagonized agent ( usually an endogenous compound , such as norepinephrine ) these agents , therefore , may be useful in individuals exhibiting excessive bradycardia with sustained beta blocker
