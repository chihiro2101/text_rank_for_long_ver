as it is rarer than previously believed , its conservation status was reassessed from least concern to near threatened in the 2007 iucn red list while not much is known about the current population , a recent study found that white-backed vultures have a high survival rate this means that the deaths of adult vultures will lead to rapid population declines the loss of adults will cause less reproduction and with younger birds less likely to survive , the population will drop drastically vultures tend not to nest in areas with high elephant populations humans also have a large impact in kenya especially , humans are using a toxic pesticide called furadan , which has led to many vulture deaths this poisoning generally occurs outside of protected areas but is a leading factor in the population 's decline this chemical is one of the greatest contaminants for the general vulture population because of its presence in livestock : easy food for the vultures another reason for the decline in the number of white-backed vultures is the decrease in the number of their nesting sites , which they construct in trees in savannah areas and which are roughly 1 meter in diameter ) and the amount of vulture nesting activity in said area , so as the amount of human activity in africa expands , the number of nesting sites available decreases , putting the vultures at jeopardy white-backed vultures circle through the sky in search of freshly dead animals , often following other scavenger birds and mammalian carnivores to find it after feeding , white-backed vultures often rest with their wings spread and their backs facing the sun , as they have gorged themselves so much they can no longer fly white-backed vultures face threats from habitat degradation and poaching ; as such they have been shown to avoid anthropogenically-disturbed areas when selecting nest sites and protection status is also a strong determinant of site selection
