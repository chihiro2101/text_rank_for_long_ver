the purpose of the usage of incense stick incense , sticks are available distinct sizes and price range evidence suggests oils were used mainly for their aroma this was the first usage of subterranean plant parts in incense the earliest documented use of incense comes from the ancient chinese , who employed incense composed of herbs and plant products ( such as cassia , cinnamon , styrax , and sandalwood ) as a component of numerous formalized ceremonial rites a variety of materials have been used in making incense the combustible base of a direct burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a self-sustained ember , which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark time fragrant materials are added to the base prior to shaping , as in the case of powdered incense materials , or after , as in the case of essential oils mucilaginous material , which can be derived from many botanical sources , is mixed with fragrant materials and water incense is available in various forms and degrees of processing indirect-burning incense , also called '' non-combustible incense '' , is an aromatic material or combination of materials , such as resins , that does not contain combustible material and so requires a separate heat source in the west , the best known incense materials of this type are the resins frankincense and myrrh , likely due to their numerous mentions in the bible whole : the incense material is burned directly in raw form on top of coal embers powdered or granulated : incense broken into smaller pieces burns quickly and provides brief but intense odor much arabian incense , also called '' bukhoor '' or '' bakhoor '' , is of this type , and japan has a history of kneaded incense , called nerikō or awasekō , made using this method within the eastern orthodox christian tradition , raw frankincense is ground into a fine powder and then mixed with various sweet-smelling essential oils the following types are commonly encountered , though direct-burning incense can take nearly any form , whether for expedience or whimsy coil : extruded and shaped into a coil without a core , coil incense can burn for an extended period , from hours to days , and is commonly produced and used in chinese cultures cone : incense in this form burns relatively quickly this type of incense is commonly produced in india and china this is the most commonly produced form of incense in japan and tibet powder : the loose incense powder used for making indirect burning incense is sometimes burned without further processing this type of incense is easily transported and stays fresh for extremely long periods certain proportions are necessary for direct-burning incense : oil content : an excess of oils may prevent incense from smoldering effectively mixture density : incense mixtures made with natural binders must not be combined with too much water in mixing , or over-compressed while being formed , which would result in either uneven air distribution or undesirable density in the mixture , causing the incense to burn unevenly , too slowly , or too quickly this form of incense requires the least skill and equipment to manufacture , since the blanks are pre-formed in china or south east asia the incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense , or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense incense produced in this fashion has a tendency to warp or become misshapen when improperly dried , and as such must be placed in climate-controlled rooms and rotated several times through the drying process this process has been largely replaced by machines in modern incense production incense sticks produced in this fashion and burned in temples of chinese folk religion can have a thickness between 2 and 4 millimeters in most arab countries , incense is burned in the form of scented chips or blocks called bakhoor there are many different types of stick used for different purposes or on different festive days thumb chinese incense sticks for use in popular religion are generally odorless or only use the slightest trace of jasmine or rose , since it is the smoke , not the scent , which is important in conveying the prayers of the faithful to heaven though they contain no sandalwood , they often include the chinese character for sandalwood on the label , as a generic term for incense these are often quite expensive due to the use of large amounts of sandalwood , agarwood , or floral scents used the bamboo method originated in india and is distinct from the nepali/tibetan and japanese methods of stick making without bamboo cores stick machines are sometimes used , which coat the stick with paste and perfume , though the bulk of production is done by hand rolling at home incense burning may occasionally take place within the tea ceremony , just like calligraphy , ikebana , and scroll arrangement , the art of incense appreciation , is generally practiced as a separate art form from the tea ceremony , and usually within a tea room of traditional zen design and are the two most important ingredients in japanese incense the characters in agarwood mean '' incense that sinks in water '' due to the weight of the resin in the wood a similar utilitarian use of incense can be found in the post-reformation church of england although the ceremonial use of incense was abandoned until the oxford movement , it was common to have incense ( typically frankincense ) burned before grand occasions , when the church would be crowded these devices can range from a simple trail of incense material calibrated to burn in a specific time period , to elaborate and ornate instruments with bells or gongs , designed to involve multiple senses this use has been deployed in concert with religious uses by zen who claim that the incense that is part of their meditative practice is designed to keep bothersome insects from distracting the practitioner an example is the , where ( frequently costly ) raw incense materials such as agarwood are appreciated in a formal setting time-keeper incense clocks are used to time social , medical and religious practices in parts of eastern asia different types of incense burn at different rates ; therefore , different incense are used for different practices the technique used is called “ smoke cleansing ” and is done by holding a healing stone over the smoke of burning incense for 20 to 30 seconds those who used incense heavily also were 80 % more likely to develop squamous-cell carcinomas
