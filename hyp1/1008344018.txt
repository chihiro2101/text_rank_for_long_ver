political reaction resulting from the great irish famine was muted , because of the extremely limited electoral franchise that existed at the time the famine was not the only reason for the decline of the language ( the general exclusion of irish from public life and the influence of the english-speaking clergy and middle classes also played a part ) but it was a conspicuous element this led to the creation of an ireland which thought of itself as essentially english-speaking , though with a persistent and influential reaction in the form of organisations such as the gaelic league and the growth of a network of urban irish-speaking activists from the late nineteenth century on this was marked in part by the foundation of philo-celtic societies and the founding of the monthly journal an gaodhal in 1881 , the first such publication anywhere in which irish was extensively used the political liberties and freedom of opportunity they encountered in the states confirmed for them the potential of an independent ireland and often made them more passionate and optimistic than some of their brethren at home the famine and its causes became a major platform for emigrant anger , as it was the main cause for most of them being emigrants in the first place leaders such as john devoy in later decades came to play a major role in supporting irish independence it was no accident that the president of dáil éireann , éamon de valera in 1920 chose to travel to the united states , not elsewhere , in his efforts to get the irish republic recognised and accepted , or that when michael collins launched special bonds to fund the new republic , many were sold to irish americans all historians generally agree that british policies during the famine ( particularly those applied by the ministry of lord john russell ) were misguided , ill-informed , and counter-productive , and that had a similar crisis occurred in england instead of ireland then the government 's response would have been very different whether the british empire made a conscious decision to allow 1 million irish people to die , or whether the government was negligent , are issues in the debate over whether that episode of irish history was due primarily to famine or genocide desmond williams ( though not published until 1956 ) , and the important 'famine survey ' undertaken by the irish folklore commission in 1945 beyond these important cultural aspects , emigration was a continuing and embarrassing fact of irish political life in the 1940s , and there was no natural constituency for the famine victims , who had died or emigrated the 1990s marked a significant shift in attitudes towards commemorating the famine , as hundreds of events took place in ireland and throughout the irish diaspora , some of which received sponsorship from the national famine commemoration committee based in the department of the taoiseach , led by td avril doyle the guardian blair says sorry for britain 's 'failure ' in

music/song which would release from it the music frozen within '' you raise me up '' – it was in fact reading graham 's novel the whitest flower , that led norwegian composer , rolf løvland to contact graham with a melody brendan graham has also recently written a number of integrated song and narrative pieces including writing the famine in fiction and song , for the national famine commemoration
