as it was a safe seat for the unionist party ( who at the time ran in place of the conservatives ) , smith came second by some distance on both occasions smith made his maiden speech on 10 november 1970 , opposing the conservative government 's family income supplement in february 1974 smith declined harold wilson 's offer of the office of solicitor general for scotland , not wishing his political career to become sidelined as a law officer in this post , smith was the youngest member of the cabinet , and served there until the 1979 general election smith was named as parliamentarian of the year twice : first in november 1986 for his performances during the westland affair during which leon brittan resigned , and the second time in november 1989 for taking nigel lawson to task over the state of the economy and over his difficult relationship with sir alan walters , the prime minister 's economic adviser his weight dropped from at the time of the first heart attack , to when he returned to parliament on 23 january 1989 although labour had now been out of power for 13 years , their performance in the 1992 election had been much better than in the previous three the resignation of long-serving but increasingly unpopular conservative prime minister margaret thatcher , and the well-received election of john major as her successor , had seen the comfortable labour lead in the opinion polls wiped out and in the 17 months leading up to the election , its outcome had become much harder to predict in september 1992 , smith made his maiden speech as party leader , in which he attacked the government 's erm debacle eight days earlier – an event which was seen by many observers as playing a large part in determining the outcome of the next general election , long before it was even on the political horizon , as from that point onwards the labour party was ascendant in the opinion polls , winning several seats from the conservatives in by-elections ( eventually even attracting a conservative mp to defect to labour ) and trouncing them in local council elections in a june 1993 debate , smith again savaged the conservative government , saying that under john major 's premiership , '' the man with the non-midas touch is in charge during the same debate , smith commented on a recent government defeat in the newbury by-election to the liberal democrats , a poor showing in the local elections and a subsequent cabinet reshuffle by saying that '' if we were to offer that tale of events to the bbc light entertainment department as a script for a programme , i think that the producers of yes minister would have turned it down as hopelessly over the top in the same speech , smith also attacked the conservatives ' broken election promises ( in particular lamont 's recent budget decision to impose vat on domestic energy bills ) – claiming he possessed the last copy of a 1992 policy document '' to escape the central office shredder '' he also performed very well in the july 1993 motion of confidence debate on the conservative government despite his dispatch box successes ( smith was always more effective in the house of commons than on platforms or at prime minister 's questions , though he began to improve at the latter towards the end of his life ) , tony blair and gordon brown were , under smith 's leadership , restless and privately anxious that the party had adopted a '' one more heave '' approach and had become over-cautious in tackling the legacy of '' tax and spend '' despite this , during his time as leader of the labour party , smith abolished the trade union block vote at labour party conference and replaced it with '' one member , one vote '' at the 1993 party conference he also committed a future labour government to establishing a scottish parliament , an aim fulfilled by his successors after his death ( most notably his close friend donald dewar ) during smith 's tenure as leader the labour party gained a significant lead in the polls over the conservatives ; on 5 may 1994 , one week before smith 's death , the conservatives suffered a major defeat in the british council elections , their worst in over 30 years in response to his death , john major paid tribute in the house of commons to smith , culminating in the now well-known line that he and smith '' would share a drink : sometimes tea , sometimes not tea '' following smith 's death , the labour party renamed its a215 road headquarters john smith house in his memory smith 's biographer , mark stuart , claimed that smith could have won labour a victory on a scale similar to that achieved by blair because of the combination of the black wednesday debacle and internal conservative party divisions over europe since 1992 stuart argues that the lack of a '' blair effect '' would have meant that the conservative party would have held slightly over 200 seats ( rather than the 165 it actually won ) in the house of commons , leaving the conservatives in a position similar to that of labour after the 1983 general election
