clarke was worried that by walking out of depeche mode he would lose his record deal with mute records and wanted to show the label that he still had something to offer them , saying in a 2008 interview , '' when i left depeche i was n't sure i 'd still have a record deal and was keen to play the label something of my own , so i wrote the song 'only you ' but needed someone to demo it with '' mute asked the duo to record the song as a single and to make an album together by this point clarke had already written '' do n't go '' , but both he and moyet felt it was too good to be the b-side of '' only you '' , so they quickly wrote the song '' situation '' together for the single 's b-side in north america , '' situation '' had been a hit in the clubs in a version remixed by new york city-based dj françois kevorkian , and against the band 's wishes , it was released as yazoo 's debut single in the us and canada , where it reached number 73 on the billboard hot 100 the duo played 24 dates in support of the album across europe and north america clarke had always seen upstairs at eric 's as a one-off project and had to be persuaded to make another yazoo record by his publishers , who felt it would not go down well if he was seen to walk out of a second band within a year of the first unlike their first record , the second album was made over a longer period of four months and with clarke and moyet rarely in the studio together at the same time ; clarke would record instrumental tracks in the morning and moyet would come in during the evening and record her vocals a single , '' nobody 's diary '' , was released in may 1983 ahead of the album and reached number three in the uk charts , but within days of the single 's release , yazoo announced that they were splitting up however , with no further singles or live appearances to promote it , it did not sell as well as upstairs at eric 's , although it still achieved gold status in the uk for sales of 100,000 copies '' he put it down to the fact that because the duo became popular so rapidly , there had never been any time to build up a personal relationship between them : '' it all happened very fast and because we had n't been in a band for years , playing in clubs , it was very much just a working relationship—we never had the chance to bond intending to record a series of one-off singles featuring different vocalists , in the end the assembly produced just one single , '' never never '' with feargal sharkey , before also splitting up the band 's output was book-ended with yet another release of '' situation '' , accompanied by many remixes clarke was tapped to remix moyet 's 1994 single '' whispering your name '' and , with erasure , clarke and moyet tried to record her single '' this house '' as a duet , but the project was never realized because sony music entertainment would not permit it '' only you '' was used in the film napoleon dynamite , the bbc television series the office , the film ca n't hardly wait , the fringe episode '' transilience thought unifier model-11 '' , the americans episode '' dimebag '' and several episodes of '' once upon a time '' season 5 despite the long estrangement , moyet had always harboured plans to perform the songs from you and me both live on stage , something that had never occurred , as the duo had split before the album was released toward the end of 2007 , she had finished promoting her album the turn and had no immediate plans for more solo work , and aware that mute were planning to issue remastered versions of yazoo 's albums , she e-mailed clarke to see if he was interested in the idea of a reunion however , shortly afterwards bell told clarke that he wanted to take a break from erasure , causing clarke to reconsider moyet 's proposal , and with a message sent via mute label head daniel miller , he indicated that he was open to reuniting for live performances on 20 january 2008 , the new official yazoo website confirmed that clarke and moyet would be reuniting to play five concerts across the uk in june 2008 , preceded by a four-disc box set entitled in your room , which would feature remastered stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes of the albums upstairs at eric 's and you and me both , a disc of b-sides and remixes and a dvd including new interviews with clarke and moyet and the videos for their five uk and us singles , along with video footage of television performances from 1982 and 1983 in an interview in may 2008 with the online magazine side-line , clarke said that there were plans to record the two london shows on the tour for a possible live album in the future
