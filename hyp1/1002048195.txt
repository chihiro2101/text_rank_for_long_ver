quid pro quo would go on to be used , by english speakers in legal and diplomatic contexts , as an exchange of equally valued goods or services and continues to be today in common law , quid pro quo indicates that an item or a service has been traded in return for something of value , usually when the propriety or equity of the transaction is in question in the united kingdom , the one-sidedness of a contract is covered by the unfair contract terms act 1977 and various revisions and amendments to it ; a clause can be held void or the entire contract void if it is deemed unfair ( that is to say , one-sided and not a quid pro quo ) ; however this is a civil law and not a common law matter in the united states , if the exchange appears excessively one sided , courts in some jurisdictions may question whether a quid pro quo did actually exist and the contract may be held void in cases of '' quid pro quo '' business contracts , the term takes on a negative connotation because major corporations may cross ethical boundaries in order to enter into these very valuable , mutually beneficial , agreements with other major big businesses ” the power dynamic between a supervisor and subordinate/job candidate is such that a supervisor could use their position of authority to extract sexual relations based on the subordinate/job candidate 's need for employment ellerth , the court stated that tangible employment action amounted to “ a significant change in employment status , such as hiring , firing , failing to promote , reassignment with significantly different responsibilities , or a decision causing a significant change in benefits ” it is important to note that only supervisors can make tangible employment actions , since they have the company 's authority to do so the court also held that unfulfilled threats by a supervisor of an adverse employment decision are not sufficient to establish a '' quid pro quo , '' but were relevant for the purposes of a hostile work environment claim additionally , the supreme court has held that constructive dismissal can count as a tangible employment action ( thus allowing a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim ) if the actions taken by a supervisor created a situation where a '' reasonable person '' once the plaintiff has established these three factors , the employer can not assert an affirmative defense ( such as the employer had a sexual harassment policy in place to prevent and properly respond to issues of sexual harassment ) , but can only dispute whether the unwelcome conduct did not in fact take place , the employee was not a supervisor , and that there was no tangible employment action involved although these terms are popular among lawyers and scholars , neither '' hostile work environment '' nor '' quid pro quo '' are found in title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 , which prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race , sex , color , national origin , and religion therefore , it is important to remember that sexual harassment can take place by a supervisor , and an employer can be potentially liable , even if that supervisor 's behavior does not fall within the criteria of a '' quid pro quo '' harassment claim
