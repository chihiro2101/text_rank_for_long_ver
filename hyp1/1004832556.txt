the first of these appeared at the base of the traditional white papal headgear in the 9th century james-charles noonan , the church visible , bruno heim , heraldry in the catholic church , humanities : 1978 , , p.50 when the popes assumed temporal power in the papal states , the base crown became decorated with jewels to resemble the crowns of princes the addition of a third crown is attributed to pope benedict xi ( 1303–1304 ) or pope clement v ( 1305–1314 ) , and one such tiara was listed in an inventory of the papal treasury in 1316 ( see '' tiara of saint sylvester '' , below ) the third crown was added to the papal tiara during the avignon papacy ( 1309–1378 ) , giving rise to the form called the triregnum lord twining wrote of a tiara of pope boniface viii that became known as the tiara of saint sylvester : twining also notes the various allegorical meanings attributed to the three crowns of the papal tiara , but concludes that '' it seems more likely that the symbolism is suggested by the idea that took shape in the 13th and 14th centuries that the emperor was crowned with three crowns—the silver crown of germany at aix-la-chapelle , the iron crown of lombardy at milan or monza and the golden imperial crown at rome and therefore the pope , too , should wear three crowns these are usually attached at the rear of the tiara , again as on a bishop 's mitre , although the mosaic of pope clement viii wearing a triregnum shows them placed forward of the ears certain fringe voices went so far as to brand paul vi an antipope , arguing that no valid pope would surrender the papal tiara after john paul i 's sudden death , pope john paul ii told the congregation at his inauguration : '' this is not the time to return to a ceremony and an object considered , wrongly , to be a symbol of the temporal power of the popes though not currently worn as part of papal regalia , the papal tiara still appears on the coats of arms of the holy see and the flag of vatican city later in his reign john paul ii approved depictions of his arms without the tiara , as with the mosaic floor piece towards the entrance of st peter 's basilica , where an ordinary mitre takes the place of the tiara coat of arms of pope benedict xvi replaced the tiara with a mitre containing three levels reminiscent of the three tiers on the papal tiara over twenty silver tiaras exist , of which the earliest , the sole survivor of 1798 , was made for pope gregory xiii in the 16th century the tiara provided by the last was made from elements of former papal tiaras destroyed after the capture of rome , and was given to pius vii as a 'wedding gift ' to mark napoleon 's own marriage to empress josephine on the eve of his imperial coronation examples include tiaras given to popes john xxiii and paul vi , the former by john 's home region , the latter by paul 's previous archiepiscopal see of milan on their election to the papacy pope paul vi , whose bullet-shaped tiara is one of the most unusual in design , was the last pope to wear a papal tiara ( though any of his successors could , if they wished , revive the custom ) except for that of pope paul vi , all were heavily gemstone there are two rather unusual tiaras : the papier-mâché tiara made when pope pius vii was elected and crowned in exile , and the one made for pope paul vi in 1963 , which is somewhat bullet-shaped , contains few jewels and , instead of being adorned by three coronets , is marked with three parallel circles and has a double-tiered crown at its base the tiara given to pope pius ix in 1877 by the vatican 's palatine guard in honour of his jubilee ( see photograph below ) is strikingly similar in design to the earlier tiara of gregory xvi pope pius xi 's 1922 crown , in contrast was much less decorated and much more conical in shape however it was never worn , as its width was made , some suspected deliberately , too small for pope pius vii to wear rather than use the papier-mâché tiara , pope gregory xvi had a new lightweight tiara made in the 1840s in the 1870s , pope pius ix , then in his eighties , found the other tiaras too heavy to wear and that of his predecessor , pope gregory , too small , so he had a lightweight tiara made also lord twining suggested that just as the holy roman emperors were crowned three times as king of germany , king of italy and roman emperor , so the popes , to stress the equality of their spiritual authority to the temporal authority of the emperor , chose to be crowned with a tiara bearing three crowns the tiara was thus worn in formal ceremonial processions , and on other occasions when the pope was carried on the sedia gestatoria , a portable throne whose use was ended by pope john paul ii immediately after his election in october 1978 the most famous occasion when the triple tiara was used was the papal coronation , a six-hour ceremony , when the new pope was carried in state on the sedia gestatoria ( portable throne ) , with attendants fanning the pontiff with ostrich-feathered flabella to the location of the coronation at the moment of the coronation , the new pope was crowned with the words pope paul vi opted for a significantly shorter ceremony only one other catholic see uses the triple tiara in its coat of arms : the patriarchate of lisbon michael levey ; the world of ottoman art , p.65 , 1975 , thames & hudson , conversely , the papal coronation ceremony , in which the pope was fanned with flabella ( long fans of ostrich feathers ) and carried on the sedia gestatoria ( portable throne ) , was based on the byzantine imperial ceremonies witnessed in medieval constantinople
