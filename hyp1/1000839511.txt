wearing is known for her method of documentation of everyday life through photography and video , concerning individual identity within the private and the public spaces , where wearing blurs the line between reality and fiction her work in photography and video at first appear like most other journalistic methods of documentation seen in television and documentaries , but after further examination it becomes apparent that they do not conform to mass-media conventions there is a recurring pattern in her work where she plays and mocks the idea of the artist as anthropologist , but her anthropological activities do not focus on discovering a foreign culture but instead challenges what we thought we already knew in an interview with donna de salvo , wearing states : '' for me , one of the biggest problems with pure documentary photography is how the photographer , like the artist , engineers something to look like a certain kind of social statement—for instance , you can make someone look miserable , when this is just one side , a nuance of their personality i couldn ’ t bear the idea of taking photographs of people without knowing '' in her piece signs that say what you want them to say and not signs that say what someone else wants you to say ( 1992–1993 ) , wearing made a series of portraits where she approaches strangers that she encounters on the street and asks them to write what they are thinking about on a white sheet of paper wearing enjoyed this method of photographing because '' when they returned with something they had written , it challenged her own perception of them '' in russel ferguson 's “ show your emotions ” he draws wearing 's use of mask draws to an older tradition that runs back to at least as far as classical greek tragedy : '' one in which the mask functions not so much to substitute one identity for another as to obliterate the superficial aspects of physical appearance in order to reveal more fundamental truths '' intrigued ? call gillian ( 1994 ) is a 30-minute long video where wearing recruited strangers through posting an ad in time out magazine and provided a space where participants would confess their terrors and fantasies to the camera , their identity protected by costume masks wearing presents this fictitious nature of the work as a report what 's intriguing about this piece is that it seems like that it 's not the first time that the participants have told their story because of how well rehearsed it looks wearing initially wanted to ask for permission to film the woman , although she decided to cover her own face with bandages and reenact what she had seen instead in an article for the guardian she explains that the process takes four months per mask , and how at first '' some people tried to direct me to use prosthetics , but i was adamant it had to be a mask , something that transforms me entirely , something that was not grotesque but real , like a trompe l ’ oeil '' the works in album then do not necessarily put the family members as the main focus ; rather they capture wearing 's engagement with the family members at first the image appears like a backlit group portrait of british police officers but after further examination the slight movements that they make reveals that it is in fact a video in the early 1990s , wearing started putting together photography exhibitions that were based around the idea of photographing anonymous strangers in the street who she had asked to hold up a piece of paper with a message on it wearing described the piece as , '' things can not be finalized—- as far as emotions are concerned in the late 1990s , wearing made a three-channel video called drunk ( 1997-1999 ) , for which she filmed a group of street drinkers who she had got to know outside her studio against the backdrop of a white photographic backdrop wearing also released her first feature film in this year : self made
