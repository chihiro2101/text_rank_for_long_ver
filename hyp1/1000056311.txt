it is a medium to large sized tree , reaching heights of and exceptionally over in the southern appalachians where conditions favor its growth the leaves are usually long on a full-grown tree the trunk diameter often ranges from ; depending on the growing conditions , however , open grown trees can attain diameters of up to the trunk will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees , while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown the leaves can turn a characteristic brilliant red in autumn , but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals soil acidity can influence the color of the foliage and trees with female flowers are more likely to produce orange coloration while male trees produce red the buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint the red maple will begin blooming when it is about 8 years old , but it significantly varies between tree to tree : some trees may begin flowering when they are 4 years old red maple 's western range stops with the great plains where conditions become too dry for it in several other locations , the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats an example is the bluegrass region of kentucky , where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains , but is present along streams here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the grain belt , despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area in the northeastern us , red maple can be a climax forest species in certain locations , but will eventually give way to sugar maple acer rubrum does very well in a wide range of soil types , with varying textures , moisture , ph , and elevation , probably more so than any other forest tree in north america rubrum 's high ph tolerance means that it can grow in a variety of places , and it is widespread along the eastern united states while many types of tree prefer a south- or north-facing aspect , the red maple does not appear to have a preference red maple dominates such sites , but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species ' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce roots to suit its site from a young age in wet locations , red maple seedlings produce short taproots with long , well-developed lateral roots ; while on dry sites , they develop long taproots with significantly shorter laterals however , one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy red maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease , cutting , or fire red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation elk and white-tailed deer in particular use the current season 's growth of red maple as an important source of winter food generally speaking , individuals from the north flush the earliest , have the most reddish fall color , set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury the following cultivars are completely male and are highly allergenic , with an opals allergy scale rating of 8 or higher : 'autumn flame ' ( 'flame ' ) 'autumn spire' 'columnare ' ( 'pyramidale ' ) 'firedance ' ( 'landsburg ' ) 'karpick' 'northwood' 'october brilliance' 'sun valley' 'tiliford' the following cultivars have an opals allergy scale rating of 3 or lower ; they are completely female trees , and have low potential for causing allergies : 'autumn glory' 'bowhall' 'davey red' 'doric' 'embers' 'festival' 'october glory' 'red skin' 'red sunset ' ( 'franksred ' ) red maple 's rapid growth , ease of transplanting , attractive form , and value for wildlife ( in the eastern us ) has made it one of the most extensively planted trees red maple is a good choice of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system like several other maples , its low root system can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving 'autumn flame ' – a fast grower with exceptional bright red fall color developing early the leaves are also smaller than the species 'columnare ' – an old cultivar growing to with a narrow columnar to pyramidal form with dark green leaves turning orange and deep red in fall 'gerling ' – a compact , slow growing selection , this individual only reaches and has orange-red fall foliage though the foliage is deep green in summer , its orange-red fall color is not as impressive as other cultivars along with 'red sunset ' , it is the most popular selection due to the dependable fall color and vigorous growth 'schlesingeri ' – a tree with a broad crown and early , long lasting fall color that is a deep red to reddish purple 'shade king ' – this fast growing cultivar has an upright-oval form with deep green summer leaves that turn red to orange in fall drake ' – this selection is notable because the edges of the leaves first turn a deep red before the color progresses into the center thus , high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple , particularly when it comes to making stain/paint-grade furniture
