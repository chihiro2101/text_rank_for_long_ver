he attributed that to either the absorption of light within the galaxy or to modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to any form of missing matter in 1959 , louise volders used the same telescope to demonstrate that the spiral galaxy m33 also does not spin as expected according to keplerian dynamics ( 1940 ) , some problems concerning the structure and dynamics of the galactic system and the elliptical nebulae ngc 3115 and 4494 on page 302-303 of his journal article , he wrote that '' the strongly condensed luminous system appears imbedded in a large and more or less homogeneous mass of great density '' and although he went on to speculate that this mass may be either extremely faint dwarf stars or interstellar gas and dust , he had clearly detected the dark matter halo of this galaxy these results suggested that either gravity does not apply universally or that , conservatively , upwards of 50 % of the mass of galaxies was contained in the relatively dark galactic halo this implies that spiral galaxies contain large amounts of dark matter or , in alternative , the existence of exotic physics in action on galactic scales the measurement of the kinematics ( their positions , velocities and accelerations ) of the observable stars and gas has become a tool to investigate the nature of dark matter , as to its content and distribution relative to that of the various baryonic components of those galaxies so , while state-of-the-art cosmological and galaxy formation simulations of dark matter with normal baryonic matter included can be matched to galaxy observations , there is not yet any straightforward explanation as to why the observed scaling relationship exists very importantly , the analysis of the inner parts of low and high surface brightness galaxies showed that the shape of the rotation curves in the centre of dark-matter dominated systems indicates a profile different from the nfw spatial mass distribution profile simulations involving the feedback of stellar energy into the interstellar medium in order to alter the predicted dark matter distribution in the innermost regions of galaxies are frequently invoked in this context mond has had a considerable amount of success in predicting the rotation curves of low-surface-brightness galaxies , matching the baryonic tullyâ€“fisher relation , and the velocity dispersions of the small satellite galaxies of the local group using data from the spitzer photometry and accurate rotation curves ( sparc ) database , a group has found the radial acceleration traced by rotation curves could be predicted just from the observed baryon distribution ( that is , including stars and gas but not dark matter ) . a model of galaxy based on a general relativity metric was also proposed , showing that the rotation curves for the milky way , ngc 3031 , ngc 3198 and ngc 7331 are consistent with the mass density distributions of the visible matter , avoiding the need for a massive halo of exotic dark matter according to a 2020 analysis of the data produced by the gaia spacecraft , it would seem possible to explain at least the milky way 's rotation curve without requiring any dark matter if instead of a newtonian approximation the entire set of equations of general relativity is adopted
