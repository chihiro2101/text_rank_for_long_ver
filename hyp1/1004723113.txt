in classical physics , an effect can not occur before its cause which is why solutions such as the advanced time solutions of the liénard–wiechert potential are discarded as physically meaningless in both einstein 's theory of special and general relativity , causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause that is not in the back ( past ) light cone of that event this requirement has been very influential in the past , in the first place as a result of direct observation of causal processes ( like pushing a cart ) , in the second place as a problematic aspect of newton 's theory of gravitation ( attraction of the earth by the sun by means of action at a distance ) replacing mechanistic proposals like descartes ' vortex theory ; in the third place as an incentive to develop dynamic field theories ( e.g in the theory of general relativity , the concept of causality is generalized in the most straightforward way : the effect must belong to the future light cone of its cause , even if the spacetime is curved new subtleties must be taken into account when we investigate causality in quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory in particular however , the principle of locality is disputed : whether it strictly holds depends on the interpretation of quantum mechanics chosen , especially for experiments involving quantum entanglement that satisfy bell 's theorem the word causality in this context means that all effects must have specific physical causes due to fundamental interactions indeed , it is possible to consider the newtonian equations of motion of the gravitational interaction of two bodies , : m_1 \frac_2 ( t ) of the two bodies , without interpreting the right hand sides of these equations as forces ; the equations just describe a process of interaction , without any necessity to interpret one body as the cause of the motion of the other , and allow one to predict the states of the system at later ( as well as earlier ) times in the d-n view , a physical state is considered to be explained if , applying the ( deterministic ) law , it can be derived from given initial conditions thus , in classical physics , it was assumed that all events are caused by earlier ones according to the known laws of nature , culminating in pierre-simon laplace 's claim that if the current state of the world were known with precision , it could be computed for any time in the future or the past ( see laplace 's demon ) if the wave function is presumed not to actually collapse as in the many-worlds interpretation , or if its collapse is due to hidden variables , or simply redefining determinism as meaning that probabilities rather than specific effects are determined ) theories in physics like the butterfly effect from chaos theory open up the possibility of a type of distributed parameter systems in causality the butterfly effect theory proposes : '' small variations of the initial condition of a nonlinear dynamical system may produce large variations in the long term behavior of the system a related way to interpret the butterfly effect is to see it as highlighting the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a causality as represented by inus in causal set theory , causality takes an even more prominent place '' the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics '' 3.10 the arrow of time in the transactional interpretation – the formalism of quantum mechanics , at least in its relativistically invariant formulation , is completely even handed in dealing with the '' arrow '' of time , the distinction between future and past time directions
