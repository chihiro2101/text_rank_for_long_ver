in some accents , various sounds have merged in that they are no longer distinctive , and thus words that differ only by those sounds in an accent that maintains the distinction ( a minimal pair ) are homophonous in the accent with the merger examples of same-sounding phrases ( which may only be true homophones in certain dialects of english ) include : : '' ice cream '' vs '' during the 1980s , an attempt was made to promote a distinctive term for same sounding multiple words or phrases , by referring to them as '' oronyms '' as in other languages , however , there exists regional and/or individual variation in certain groups of words or in single words , so that the number of homophones varies accordingly individual variation is shown by a pair like gäste ( guests ) – geste ( gesture ) , the latter of which varies between /ˈɡe : stə/ and /ˈɡɛstə/ and by a pair like stiel ( handle , stalk ) – stil ( style ) , the latter of which varies between /ʃtiːl/ and /stiːl/ there are many homophones in japanese , due to the use of sino-japanese vocabulary , where borrowed words and morphemes from chinese are widely used in japanese , but many sound differences , such as the original words ' tones , are lost 二本 , both pronounced nihon , but with different pitches ) , or from context , but many of these words are primarily or almost exclusively used in writing , where they are easily distinguished as they are written with different kanji ; others are used for puns , which are frequent in japanese an extreme example is kikō ( hiragana : きこう ) , which is the pronunciation of at least 22 words ( some quite rare or specialized , others common ; all these examples are two-character compounds ) , including : 機構 ( organization/mechanism ) , 紀行 ( travelogue ) , 稀覯 ( rare ) , 騎行 ( horseback riding ) , 貴校 ( school ( respectful ) ) , 奇功 ( outstanding achievement ) , 貴公 ( word for '' you '' used by men addressing male equals or inferiors ) , 起稿 ( draft ) , 奇行 ( eccentricity ) , 機巧 ( contrivance ) , 寄港 ( stopping at port ) , 帰校 ( returning to school ) , 気功 ( breathing exercise/qigong ) , 寄稿 ( contribute an article/written piece ) , 機甲 ( armor , e.g due to chinese being pronounced with varying tones and korean 's removal of those tones , and because the modern korean writing system , hangeul , has a more finite number of phonemes than , for example , latin-derived alphabets such as that of english , there are many homonyms with both the same spelling and pronunciation also , ' however , even with tones , mandarin retains a very large amount of homophones many scholars believe that the chinese language did not always have such a large number of homophones and that the phonological structure of chinese syllables was once more complex , which allowed for a larger amount of possible syllables so that words sounded more distinct from each other since words in old chinese sounded more distinct from each other at this time , it explains why many words in classical chinese consisted of only one syllable for example , the standard chinese word 狮子 ( shīzi , meaning '' lion '' ) was simply 狮 ( shī ) in classical chinese , and the standard mandarin word 教育 ( jiàoyù , '' education '' ) was simply 教 ( jiào ) in classical chinese since many chinese words became homophonic over the centuries , it became difficult to distinguish words when listening to documents written in classical chinese being read aloud for this reason , many one-syllable words from classical chinese became two-syllable words , like the words mentioned in the previous paragraph another complication that arises within the chinese language is that in non-rap songs , tones are disregarded in favor of maintaining melody in the song although the song lacks mandarin tones , much like most songs in mandarin , it is implied that the english speaker probably used the wrong tones when saying the word for example , groan/grone and crane/crain are pseudo-homophone pairs , whereas plane/plain is a homophone pair since both letter strings are recognised words homophones , specifically heterographs , where one spelling is of a threatening nature and one is not ( e.g
