in addition to the field of cognitive psychology , the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields ( e.g erikson writes that the indians ' collective historic identity as buffalo hunters was oriented around such fundamentally different reasons/goals that even communication about the divergent '' life plans '' was itself difficult in short , philosophical stance codified in the mind , hence as mindset , lead to a climate that in turn causes values that lead to practice as previously alluded to , there is a great deal of variation within the study of mindsets nevertheless , any discussion of mindset should include recognition concerning the numerous , varied , and growing number of mindsets and mindset theories that receive attention in multiple disciplines throughout the academy dweck states that there are two categories ( growth mindset versus fixed mindset ) that can group individuals based on their behaviour , specifically their reaction to failure people with a '' fixed mindset '' believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities , while those with a '' growth mindset '' believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study in a 2012 interview , dweck defined both fixed and growth mindsets : an example of a person with a growth mindset is an employee who , when posed with an extraordinarily challenging assignment , takes the project as a growing opportunity instead of one that will defeat them a large part of dweck 's research on mindsets has been done in the field of education , and how these mindsets affect a student 's performance in the classroom in order for students to effectively adopt a growth mindset , a classroom culture needs to be established that nurtures this type of thinking according to dweck ( 2010 ) , '' praising students for the process they have engaged in—the effort they applied , the strategies they used , the choices they made , the persistence they displayed , and so on—yields more long-term benefits than telling them they are 'smart ' when they succeed '' a second strategy to promote a growth-mindset culture in the classroom is to explicitly teach lessons related to what it means to adopt a growth mindset possible activities include establishing personal goals , writing letters , or having students share with one another something they used to be poor at and now are very good at in a recent study by hussein ( 2018 ) , the effects of reflective journal writing on students ' growth mindset was examined it was found that the use of journaling could positively affect a student 's learning process by improving their conceptual knowledge , promoting growth mindset , and enhancing understanding of their thoughts through writing the way educators evaluate their students ' work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom overall , it is clear to see that a classroom that includes challenging learning tasks , praising of the process , and explicit growth mindset teaching and assessment , is a classroom where students will have the tools needed to become lifelong learners while elements of our personality – such as sensitivity to mistakes and setbacks – can make us predisposed towards holding a certain mindset , we are able to develop and reshape our mindset through our interactions these studies all demonstrate how framing and discussing students ' work and effort play a considerable role in the type of mindset students develop and students ' conceptions of their own ability while a great deal of research in the education field has focused on a students ability to adopt a growth mindset , less attention and focus has been given to teacher mindsets and the role they play in influencing their students a study conducted by seaton ( 2018 ) , looked specifically at the impact of teacher training aimed at influencing their mindsets and the effect on their resulting practice this study reinforces the bond between a teacher 's own beliefs and how they can strongly influence the mindset of his/her students ; therefore , further highlighting the need for proper teacher training in order for mindset initiatives within schools to be fully successful in boaler 's ability and mathematics : the mindset revolution that is reshaping education , the author argues that fixed mindset beliefs lead to inequalities in education ; these findings partially explain low achievement and participation amongst minorities and female students boaler 's research shows that many women feel as though they are not smart enough nor capable enough to continue in certain subjects , such as stem areas of academia boaler uses carol dweck 's research showing that '' gender differences in mathematics performance only existed among fixed mindset students '' ( boaler , 2013 ) boaler said , '' the key growth mindset message was that effort changes the brain by forming new connections , and that students control this process educational systems focusing on creating a growth mindset environment allow girls to feel like their intelligence is malleable rather than constant dweck 's research and theory of growth and fixed mindsets has been useful in intervention strategies with at risk students , dispelling negative stereotypes in education held by teachers and students , understanding the impacts of self-theories on resilience , and understanding how process praise can foster a growth mindset and positively impact students ' motivation levels in particular , a study by rhew , piro , goolkasian & cosentino ( 2018 ) , suggested that a growth mindset intervention can increase the motivation levels of adolescent special education participants these studies further illustrate how educators can use intervention strategies , targeting a growth mindset , by allowing students to see that their behaviour can be changed with effort buchanan argues '' creating cultures of contribution and everyday leadership could be one of the best points of leverage we have for simultaneously bringing out the best in people , organisations and the planet he argues that mindsets guide people 's thinking and behavior and play a key role in people 's life experiences , development journey , and wellbeing one of the defining characteristics of the study of global mindset is the variety in which scholars conceptualize and operationalize the construct ; and yet ; scholars typically agree that global mindset and its development increases global effectiveness for both individuals and organizations ( french & chang , 2016 ) the defensive mindset may lead to learning based on false assumptions or prevent learning altogether ( argyris , 2004 )
