ringing contouring posterizing staircase noise ( aliasing ) along curving edges blockiness in '' busy '' regions ( block boundary artifacts , sometimes called macroblocking , quilting , or checkerboarding ) other lossy algorithms , which use pattern matching to deduplicate similar symbols , are prone to introducing hard to detect errors in printed text at low bit rates , any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries various approaches have been proposed to reduce image compression effects , but to use standardized compression/decompression techniques and retain the benefits of compression ( for instance , lower transmission and storage costs ) , many of these methods focus on '' post-processing '' â€”that is , processing images when received or viewed this method can be added as an integral part to jpeg decompressors working on the trillions of existing and future jpeg images when motion prediction is used , as in mpeg-1 , mpeg-2 or mpeg-4 , compression artifacts tend to remain on several generations of decompressed frames , and move with the optic flow of the image , leading to a peculiar effect , part way between a painting effect and '' grime '' that moves with objects in the scene data errors in the compressed bit-stream , possibly due to transmission errors , can lead to errors similar to large quantization errors , or can disrupt the parsing of the data stream entirely for a short time , leading to '' break-up '' of the picture where gross errors have occurred in the bit-stream , decoders continue to apply updates to the damaged picture for a short interval , creating a '' ghost image '' effect , until receiving the next independently compressed frame in motion compensated video compression , the current picture is predicted by shifting blocks ( macroblocks , partitions , or prediction units ) of pixels from previously decoded frames video compression artifacts include cumulative results of compression of the comprising still images , for instance ringing or other edge busyness in successive still images appear in sequence as a shimmering blur of dots around edges , called mosquito noise , as they resemble mosquitoes swarming around the object if this '' decoder '' performs a deblocking , the deblocked picture is then used as a reference picture for motion compensation , which improves coding efficiency by preventing a propagation of block artifacts across frames when the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate , when the transform block size is restrained , or when aggressive compression is used , this may result in compression artifacts rosa menkman 's glitch art makes use of compression artifacts , particularly the discrete cosine transform blocks ( dct blocks ) found in most digital media data compression formats such as jpeg digital images and mp3 digital audio another technique involves simply transcoding from one lossy video format to another , which exploits the difference in how the separate video codecs process motion and color information
