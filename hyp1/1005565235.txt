lanolin â€™ s complex composition of long-chain esters , hydroxyesters , diesters , lanolin alcohols , and lanolin acids means in addition to it being a valuable product in its own right , it is also the starting point for the production of a whole spectrum of lanolin derivatives , which possess wide-ranging chemical and physical properties lanolin alcohols are a rich source of cholesterol ( an important skin lipid ) and are powerful water-in-oil emulsifiers ; they have been used extensively in skincare products for over 100 years lanolin conforming to this monograph is intended for use in more exacting applications , for example on open wounds new products obtained using complex purification techniques produce lanolin esters in their natural state , removing oxidative and environmental impurities resulting in white , odourless , hypoallergenic lanolin the cosmetics directive ruling only applied to the presence of lanolin in cosmetic products ; it did not apply to the many hundreds of its different uses in dermatological products designed for the treatment of compromised skin conditions modern analytical methods have revealed lanolin possesses a number of important chemical and physical similarities to human stratum corneum lipids ; the lipids which help regulate the rate of water loss across the epidermis and govern the hydration state of the skin skin bioengineering studies have shown the durational effect of the emollient ( skin smoothing ) action produced by lanolin is very significant and lasts for many hours thumb lanolin and its many derivatives are used extensively in both the personal care ( e.g however , allergy to a lanolin-containing product is difficult to pinpoint and often other products containing lanolin may be fine for use lanocote ) containing up to 85 % lanolin are used to prevent corrosion in marine fasteners , especially when two different metals are in contact with each other and saltwater the water-repellent properties make it valuable in many applications as a lubricant grease where corrosion would otherwise be a problem anhydrous liquid lanolin , combined with parabens , has been used in trials as artificial tears to treat dry eye lanolin , when mixed with ingredients such as neatsfoot oil , beeswax and glycerol , is used in various leather treatments , for example in some saddle soaps and in leather care products
