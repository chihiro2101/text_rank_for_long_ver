systems without an operating system were intended for users needing dedicated applications that did not require the full capabilities of either os applications were built using a set of standalone programs , called the base program preparation facilities , consisting of a macro assembler , a link editor and some basic utilities a set of modules , called control program support ( cps ) , was linked with the application to provide task management , data processing input/output support and initial program loading for both disks and diskettes series/1 computers were also utilized in the early development of gm 's manufacturing automation protocol ( map ) commercial applications of customized series/1 computers included an application by state farm as an intelligent remote terminal in agents ' offices unusually , the communications link between the ibm series/1 machines and the icl 2900 machine used the icl co3 protocol rather than one of the ( de facto standard ) ibm communication protocols internally , ibm used banks of series/1 computers as communications front end systems on their ibm information systems commercial network although back end processing was done with system/370 architecture computers also in some ibm locations , the series/1 was employed for building access security using id card readers the 'class i ' systems were classified as mainframe systems – and the series/1 systems that provided field input to them – that were maintained at and distributed from the three cdpas designed primarily as a source data automation ( sda ) device for the enhancement of input into 'class i ' logistics and personnel computer systems , the adpe-fmf series/1 provided the power of a minicomputer to the battalion/squadron commander dozens of 'class ii ' systems were locally developed and maintained at the gsus ( general support units ) , later known as ismos ( information systems management offices ) , providing undreamed-of functionality even as far as the company and deployed unit level systems developed included the waggishly named 'standardized wing overseas operation passenger system ' ( swoops – developed to generate air force passenger manifests from personnel databases ) and 'universal random integrity news extract ' ( urine – developed to provide names picked randomly from personnel databases for urinalysis screening ) , fleas ( flight evaluation administration system ) although a cobol compiler was available as part of the software package sold to the marine corps with the series/1 , most class i and class ii systems development was in edl in the middle 1980s , the adpe-fmf equipment was gradually phased out in favor of ibm-pc class microcomputers running off-the-shelf software and marine corps developed applications written in ada
