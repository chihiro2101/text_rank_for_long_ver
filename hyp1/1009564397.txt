early life and education a gifted student , he became impatient with his studies during his first year of high school and skipped school often in favor of the library after getting failing grades as a result , he convinced his mother to send him to a special accelerated high school for adults , and subsequently did well in that environment the four became close friends , with branden and rand in particular sharing a vivid interest in philosophical exploration and development during this time , branden also contributed articles to rand 's newsletters on subjects ranging from economics to politics to psychology ( branden later explained in his memoir that he and rand had in fact been romantically intimate for a period of time in the late 1950s ; see personal life ) after the break , branden went on to publish the psychology of self-esteem ( many chapters of which he had published originally in rand 's newsletter ) , and then to develop his theory and mode of therapy more independently of rand 's influence though he remained supportive of the broad essentials of rand 's philosophy , he eventually offered criticisms of aspects of her work , naming as problems a tendency to encourage emotional repression and moralizing , a failure to understand psychology beyond its cognitive aspects , and a failure to appreciate adequately the importance of kindness in human relationships he defined self-esteem formally as '' the disposition to experience oneself as competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and as worthy of happiness '' , and proposed that , while others ( parents , teachers , friends ) can nurture and support self-esteem in an individual , self-esteem also relies upon various internally generated practices branden distinguished his approach to self-esteem from that of many others by his inclusion of both confidence and worth in his definition of self-esteem , and by his emphasis on the importance of internally generated practices for the improvement and maintenance of self-esteem for this reason , he at times expressed lack of enthusiasm about the teachings of the '' self-esteem movement '' , which he is sometimes credited with having spawned ( he was sometimes referred to as '' the father of the self-esteem movement '' ) by improvising a succession of such stems , many based on endings generated by a previous stem , a therapist can , according to branden , lead a client on a sometimes dramatically emotional journey of self exploration and self-discovery branden reported that in this period rand began seeking a resumption of their affair ; his own marriage , meanwhile , was deteriorating , although he and barbara were becoming closer as friends despite rand 's romantic involvement with nathaniel , her close intellectual collaboration with him , and her strong public endorsements of him , both brandens kept nathaniel 's affair with patrecia secret from rand , fearing her reaction branden retained a relationship—sometimes friendly , sometimes acrimonious—with his first wife , barbara , who wrote a successful biography , the passion of ayn rand , which presented her version of branden 's relationship with rand and the bitter breakup who is ayn rand ?
