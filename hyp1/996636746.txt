63 with his army of the reserve ( officially commanded by louis alexandre berthier ) in mid-may 1800 almost before the passes were open , bonaparte ( who crossed on a mule ) had threatened melas ' lines of communications in northern italy however , genoa surrendered on 4 june , freeing a large number of austrians for operations against the french as other french forces closed from the west and south , the austrian commander had withdrawn most of his troops from their positions near nice and genoa to alessandria on the main turin-mantua road the austrians planned to fight their way out eastward but—using a local double agent , usually known by his cover of françois toli—attempted to deceive bonaparte into thinking they would try to march north , cross the po and head for milan , joined by the remaining troops marching up from genoa the spy would advise bonaparte to march via sale on the northern side of the plain , so that he could be engaged by the austrian left wing ; meanwhile the main force would move through marengo village in the centre , turn north and fall into the french left flank the senior generals of the austrian army strongly approved this plan , as the alternative would have meant that the army would have had to retreat along the river po and leave piedmont to the enemy without a fight nonetheless , by abandoning the san giuliano plain , where the superior austrian cavalry could have given him an edge , melas probably made a serious mistake following his meeting with the spy and fearing that the austrian general might try to escape , bonaparte spread his army out in a wide net by sending louis desaix with divisional general jean boudet 's division ( 6,000 men ) south to novi ligure and divisional general jean françois cornu de la poype ( 3,500 men ) north on the other bank of the po austrian headquarters debated building a bridge to the north to outflank the french , but the lack of pontoons and time forced the austrians to cross the river bormida and then launch a single , direct assault across the fontanone bridge 117–118 in 1799 the 36,000 french troops in italy were in a desperate state similar to that at the end of 1795 additional veteran troops came from the remains of the former army of england to the east of castel ceriolo took position jean-charles monnier 's division , supported by the guard , which formed the reserve poor austrian staff work prevented any rapid development of their attack and the entire army had to file through a narrow bridgehead the 1,200-man austrian advance guard , under colonel ( oberst ) johann maria philipp frimont and a division of 3,300 men under fml o'reilly , pushed the french outposts back and deployed to become the austrian right wing , driving the enemy from pedrabona farm , then heading south to tackle the french at la stortiglione farm 149 on the austrian left , 7,500 men under fml peter ott waited for the road to clear before heading for the village of castel ceriolo well to the north of the french positions 607 melas also committed a serious tactical blunder , detaching generalmajor ( gm ) nimptsch 's brigade of 2,300 hussars and two artillery batteries back over the bormida bridge to block the corps of general louis gabriel suchet , which was mistakenly reported around 9 & nbsp ; am from acqui terme to be approaching alessandria from the south 151 besides delaying the crossing of the austrian left wing , this also meant that , being 30 kilometers away , nimptsch 's brigade would play no part in the battle it took bonaparte ( 5 kilometers away from marengo ) until about 10 & nbsp ; am to recognize that the austrian activity was not a diversionary attack to cover the anticipated retreat by melas kellermann 's heavy cavalry brigade and the 8 th dragoons took up a covering position on the left , smashing an attempt by gm giovanni pilatti 's light dragoon brigade which attempted to cross the steep-sided fontanone at its southern end to envelop victor 's flank a small part of the 6 ème légère ( 6 th light infantry regiment ) occupied castel ceriolo to the north , but soon ott 's lead units took it around 11:30 & nbsp ; am and began putting pressure on the french right flank ott could not see any sign of the expected main french advance from sale ( to the northeast ) , so he sent gm friedrich heinrich von gottesheim ’ s reinforced advance guard to outflank lannes north of marengo as they came up , gdd jean-charles monnier 's division and the consular guard were committed to extend and shore up the french right , rather than to try to hold marengo where victor 's men were running short of ammunition toward 12:30 & nbsp ; pm lannes moved the rest of his force to face gottesheim in a hook shape , while kaim attacked again , but this time against victor 's wings in a bid to further delay schellenberg 's advance , bonaparte committed his main guard battalion and its artillery , which moved to flank the column the austrian centre formed into a massive pursuit column in order to chase the french off the battlefield , with the advance guard commanded by gm franz xaver saint-julien on the austrian right wing , o'reilly wasted time hunting down a 300-man french detachment led by achille dampierre ( which was finally captured ) and moved southeast this took his troops out of supporting distance from the austrian main body shortly before 5:00 & nbsp ; pm , he reported to bonaparte in person with the news that his force ( 6,000 men and 9 guns of boudet 's division ) was not far behind 269 the french were fast to bring up and deploy the fresh troops in front of san giuliano , and the austrians were slow to mount their attack as the austrian infantry deployed on the south side of the road , the 9 ème légère conducted a steady withdrawal for 30 minutes back to desaix 's position there he had placed gdb louis charles de guénand 's brigade on the north side while most of the remaining french army ( monnier and lannes ) were forming up north from there the gun teams fled , pursued by french cavalry , while their whole infantry line advanced westward 607–608 the second grenadier brigade under gm karl philippi von weidenfeld and some unpanicked cavalry delayed boudet 's advance long enough for o ’ reilly 's cavalry to return , and together with frimont , they mounted a last defense around marengo village as night fell , allowing the austrian centre to reach safety behind the bormida 180–181 ott with the austrian left failed to intervene and found his retreat through castel ceriolo blocked by french troops advancing northwest from the centre , but managed to fight his way back to the bormida bridgehead a last-gasp victory in reality , marengo was mythologised in an army bulletin and three increasingly glamourised '' official reports '' during bonaparte 's reign '' however , in the bulletin de l'armée issued the following day , napoleon sought to counterbalance kellermann 's charge with jean-baptiste bessières 's : '' the chef de brigade bessières , in front of the reckless grenadiers of the guard , executed a charge with as much activity as valour and penetrated the line of the enemy cavalry ; this resulted in the entire rout of the army several participants to the fighting reveal the precarious condition of the army throughout the day , including marmont in his memoirs , captain coignet : '' we were retreating in good order but all ready to start running at the earliest sign of danger '' , captain gervais : '' in this battle , we were many times on the verge of being defeated this is exactly the place where most of the fights between the french and austrian armies took place
