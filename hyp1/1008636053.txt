in many cultures , marriage is generally expected that a woman will take her husband 's surname , though that is not universal a married woman may indicate her marital status in a number of ways : in western culture a married woman would commonly wear a wedding ring but in other cultures other markers of marital status may be used , by roman catholic ritual , the word bride actually means fiancée and applies up to the exchange of matrimonial consent ( the actual marriage act ) ; from then on , even while the rest of the very ceremony is ongoing , the woman is a wife , and no longer a bride , and the bridal couple is no longer referred to as such but as the newlywed couple in some societies , especially historically , a concubine was a woman who was in an ongoing , usually matrimonially oriented relationship with a man who could not be married to her , often because of a difference in social status the term wife is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law ( including religious law ) , not to a woman in an informal cohabitation relationship , which may be known as a girlfriend , partner , cohabitant , significant other , concubine , mistress etc however , a woman in a so-called common law marriage may describe herself as a common law wife , de facto wife , or simply a wife those seeking to advance gender neutrality may refer to both marriage partners as '' spouses '' , and many countries and societies are rewording their statute law by replacing '' wife '' and '' husband '' with '' spouse '' in some cultures , the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless , as in the case of those cultures that practiced sati , a funeral ritual within some asian communities , in which a recently widowed woman self-immolation , typically on the husband 's funeral pyre the legal rights of a wife have been since the 19th century , and still are , in many jurisdictions subject to debate spain , in 1981 , spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands ’ permission to initiate judicial proceedings and france although married women in france obtained the right to work without their husbands ' permission in 1965 , and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 ( before that parental responsibilities belonged to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children ) , it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children 's property in various marriage laws around the world , however , the husband continues to have authority ; for instance the civil code of iran states at article 1105 : '' in relations between husband and wife ; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband '' in some cultures , it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family , but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife , the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family ; but during the marriage , the dowry was often made inalienable by the husband changing of name upon marriage in some cultures , particularly in the anglophone west , wives often change their surnames to that of the husband upon getting married some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to women 's rights , and have restricted or banned it ; for example , since 1983 , when greece adopted a new marriage law which guaranteed gender equality between the spouses , women in greece are required to keep their birth names for their whole life traditionally , and still in many cultures , the role of a wife was closely tied to that of a mother , by a strong expectation that a wife ought to bear children , while , conversely , an unmarried woman should not have a child out of wedlock children born outside marriage have become more common in many countries in addition , some religions are interpreted as requiring children in marriage ; for instance pope francis said in 2015 that choosing not to have children was '' selfish '' in ancient roman law , first marriages to brides aged 12–25 required the consent of the bride and her father , but by the late antique period roman law permitted women over 25 to marry without parental consent in late antiquity , under roman law , daughters inherited equally from their parents if no will was produced christian cultures claim to be guided by the new testament in regard to their view on the position of a wife in society as well as her marriage in the medieval period , this was understood to mean that a wife should not share a husband with other wives frances burney , evelina , lowndes 1778 , and seeber , english literary history of the eighteenth century , weimar 1999 in the 12th century , the roman catholic church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents ' approval , even if their marriage was made clandestinely parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry against their parents ' approval under the english common law system , which dates to the later medieval period , daughters and younger sons were usually excluded from landed property if no will was produced under english common law , there was a system where a wife with a living husband ( '' feme couvert '' ) could own little property in her own name in the 18th and 19th centuries , which contained much criticism of these facts , see also mary wollstonecraft , a vindication of the rights of women , boston 1792 the situation was assessed by the english conservative moralist sir william blackstone : '' the husband and wife are one , and the husband is the one '' william blackstone , commentaries upon the laws of england married women 's property rights in the english-speaking world improved with the married women 's property act 1882 and similar legal changes , which allowed wives with living husbands to own property in their own names until late in the 20th century , women could in some regions or times sue a man for wreath money when he took her virginity without taking her as his wife the high age at first marriage for western women has been shown by many parish reconstruction studies to be a traditional western marriage pattern that dates back at least as early as the mid-16th century in the 20th century , the role of the wife in western marriage changed in two major ways ; the first was the breakthrough from an '' institution to companionate marriage '' ; '' companionship marriage '' and '' companionate marriage '' are synonyms ( the latter being the older one ) , although the term usually refers to a relationship based on equality , it might instead refer to a marriage with mutual interest in their children , for the first time since the middle ages , wives became distinct legal entities , and were allowed their own property and allowed to sue the second change was the drastic alteration of middle and upper-class family life , when in the 1960s these wives began to work outside their home , and with the social acceptance of divorces the single-parent family , and stepfamily or '' blended family '' as a more '' individualized marriage '' the status of marriage , as opposed to unmarried pregnant women , allows the spouse to be responsible for the child , and to speak on behalf of their wife ; a partner is also responsible for the wife 's child in states where they are automatically assumed to be the biological legal parent in indo-aryan languages , a wife is known as patni , which means a woman who shares everything in this world with her husband and he does the same , including their identity in recent times however the western culture has had significant influence and the new generations are more open to the idea of marrying for love in hinduism , a wife is known as a patni or ardhangini ( similar to '' the better half '' ) meaning a part of the husband or his family the arranged marriage is relatively common in traditionalist families , whether in muslim countries or as first or second generation immigrants elsewhere however , women 's wedding rings have recently been adopted in the past thirty years from the western culture there is a widely held expectation , which has existed for most of recorded history and in most cultures , that a wife is not to have sexual relations with anyone other than her legal husband
