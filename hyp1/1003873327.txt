bill mcandrew , nbc 's director of news ( later nbc news president ) , had seen a highly rated local news program on nbc affiliate wsaz-tv in huntington , west virginia , with two anchors reporting from different cities producer reuven frank , who had advocated pairing huntley and brinkley for the convention coverage , thought using two anchors on a regular news program '' was one of the dumber ideas i had ever heard '' nonetheless , on the day of the new program 's first broadcast , frank authored the program 's closing line , '' good night , chet ( when one was on vacation the other would typically handle the full broadcast alone , leaving viewers with a familiar anchor instead of a little-known substitute such as a field reporter critics considered huntley to possess one of the best broadcast voices ever heard , and brinkley 's dry , often witty , newswriting presented viewers a contrast to the often sober output from cbs news '' the program received the award again two years later in the same category , the committee concluding that huntley and brinkley had '' dominated the news division of television so completely in the past year that it would be unthinkable to present a peabody award in that category to anybody else '' by that time , the program had surpassed cbs 's evening news program , douglas edwards with the news , in ratings and maintained higher viewership levels for much of the 1960s , even after walter cronkite took over cbs 's competing program ( initially named walter cronkite with the news in 1962 and renamed the cbs evening news with walter cronkite in 1963 ) in fact , aside from their sign-off , huntley and brinkley 's only communication came when one anchor finished a story and handed off to the other by saying the other 's name , a signal to an at & t technician to switch the long-distance transmission lines from new york to washington or vice versa the network 's weekend programs , saturday 's scherer-macneil report and sunday 's frank mcgee report , were also broadcast in color at that time the program 's ratings slipped late in the decade as cbs 's walter cronkite gained fame for his coverage of the space program , a field in which neither huntley nor brinkley had much interest ( although huntley and brinkley occasionally participated in space coverage , another nbc newsman , frank mcgee , was the prime anchor of nbc 's space coverage ) for most of its run , the huntleyâ€“brinkley report aired only monday through friday , but in january 1969 , the network expanded it to saturday evenings , with huntley and brinkley working solo on alternating weeks , although sometimes , the other would be seen in a taped essay or commentary recorded on friday the frank mcgee report , a documentary program not tied to the day 's news , aired on sundays in the time slot in leaving this post after almost 14 years , i recommend to you the nbc nightly news , which begins tomorrow '' : :david brinkley : '' chet , i , too , would like to thank all of those who tuned us in and put up with us , particularly including those who write the nasty letters ! mcgee and chancellor and i will be here every night , and we will miss you
