one form of charge is the use of an exchange rate that is less favourable than the wholesale spot rate both are '' other '' ) , market convention is to use the fixed currency which gives an exchange rate greater than 1.000 quotation using a country 's home currency as the price currency is known as direct quotation or price quotation ( from that country 's perspective ) for example , eur 0.8989 usd 1.00 in the eurozone understanding foreign exchange : exchange rates and is used in most countries using direct quotation , if the home currency is strengthening ( that is , appreciating , or becoming more valuable ) then the exchange rate number decreases the contraction of spreads ( the difference between the bid and ask rates ) arguably necessitated finer pricing and gave the banks the ability to try and win transactions on multibank trading platforms where all banks may otherwise have been quoting the same price in free-floating regimes , exchange rates are allowed to vary against each other according to the market forces of supply and demand exchange rates for such currencies are likely to change almost constantly as quoted on financial markets , mainly by banks , around the world in general , the exchange rate where the foreign currency is converted to a smaller number of domestic currencies is the buying rate , which indicates how much the country 's currency is required to buy a certain amount of foreign exchange it indicates how much the country 's currency needs to be recovered if the bank sells a certain amount of foreign exchange the exchange rate that is generally listed on the foreign exchange market is generally referred to as the spot exchange rate unless it specifically indicates the forward exchange rate ; according to the method of setting the exchange rate : basic rate : usually choose a key convertible currency that is the most commonly used in international economic transactions and accounts for the largest proportion of foreign exchange reserves compare it with the currency of the country and set the exchange rate cross rate : after the basic exchange rate is worked out , the exchange rate of the local currency against other foreign currencies can be calculated through the basic exchange rate ; according to the international exchange rate regime : fixed exchange rate : it means that the exchange rate between a country 's currency and another country 's currency is basically fixed , and the fluctuation of exchange rate is very small floating exchange rate : it means that the monetary authorities of a country do not stipulate the official exchange rate of the country 's currency against other currencies , nor does it have any upper or lower limit of exchange rate fluctuations the local currency is determined by the supply and demand relationship of the foreign exchange market , and it is free to rise and fall balance of payments : when a country has a large international balance of payments deficit or trade deficit , it means that its foreign exchange earnings are less than foreign exchange expenditures and its demand for foreign exchange exceeds its supply , so its foreign exchange rate rises , and its currency depreciates when a country raises its interest rate or its domestic interest rate is higher than the foreign interest rate , it will cause capital inflow , thereby increasing the demand for domestic currency , allowing the currency to appreciate and the foreign exchange depreciate venture capital : if speculators expect a certain currency to appreciate , they will buy a large amount of that currency , which will cause the exchange rate of that currency to rise speculation is an important factor in the short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate of the foreign exchange market government market intervention : when exchange rate fluctuations in the foreign exchange market adversely affect a country 's economy , trade , or the government needs to achieve certain policy goals through exchange rate adjustments , monetary authorities can participate in currency trading , buying or selling local or foreign currencies in large quantities in the market the foreign exchange supply and demand has caused the exchange rate to change economic strength of a country : in general , high economic growth rates are not conducive to the local currency 's performance in the foreign exchange market in the short term , but in the long run , they strongly support the strong momentum of the local currency a market-based exchange rate will change whenever the values of either of the two component currencies change in general , the higher a country 's interest rates , the greater will be the demand for that currency the real exchange rate ( rer ) is the purchasing power of a currency relative to another at current exchange rates and prices it is the ratio of the number of units of a given country 's currency necessary to buy a market basket of goods in the other country , after acquiring the other country 's currency in the foreign exchange market , to the number of units of the given country 's currency that would be necessary to buy that market basket directly in the given country thus the real exchange rate is the exchange rate times the relative prices of a market basket of goods in the two countries if all goods were freely tradable , and foreign and domestic residents purchased identical baskets of goods , purchasing power parity ( ppp ) would hold for the exchange rate and gdp deflators ( price levels ) of the two countries , and the real exchange rate would always equal 1 the real exchange rate ( rer ) represents the nominal exchange rate adjusted by the relative price of domestic and foreign goods and services , thus reflecting the competitiveness of a country with respect to the rest of the world in many countries there is a distinction between the official exchange rate for permitted transactions and a parallel exchange rate that responds to excess demand for foreign currency at the official exchange rate uncovered interest rate parity ( uirp ) states that an appreciation or depreciation of one currency against another currency might be neutralized by a change in the interest rate differential the future exchange rate is reflected into the forward exchange rate stated today the spot market represents current exchange rates , whereas options are derivatives of exchange rates a country may gain an advantage in international trade if it market manipulation for its currency to keep its value low , typically by the national central bank engaging in open market operations in the foreign exchange market black wednesday bureau de change current account currency strength dynamic currency conversion effective exchange rate euro calculator foreign exchange fraud foreign exchange market financial centre functional currency tables of historical exchange rates to the usd telegraphic transfer usd index
