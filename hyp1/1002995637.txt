by turning to film-originated material , they would have access to the wealth of films made for the cinema in addition to recorded television programming on film that could be aired at different times however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering 368-9 non-live programming could also be filmed using the same cameras , edited mechanically as normal , and then played back for tv various displays , including projectors for these '' video rate films '' , slide projectors and film cameras were often combined into a '' film chain '' , allowing the broadcaster to cue up various forms of media and switch between them by moving a mirror or prism for ntsc , the difference in frame rates can be corrected by showing every fourth frame of film twice , although this does require the sound to be handled separately to avoid '' skipping '' effects a more advanced technique is to use '' 2:3 pulldown '' , discussed below , which turns every second frame of the film into three fields of video , which results in a slightly smoother display this is relatively easy when the film is photographed at the same frame rate as the video camera will sample , but when this is not true , a sophisticated procedure is required to change frame rate this allows them to scan a distinct frame of digital video for each frame of film , providing higher quality than a telecine system would be able to achieve the pal video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second , so the transfer from film to video is simple ; for every film frame , one video frame is captured 2:2 pulldown is also used to transfer shows and films , photographed at 30 frames per second , like friends and oklahoma ! ( 1955 ) , to ntsc video , which has ~59.94 & nbsp ; hz scanning rate although the 4 % speed increase has been standard since the early days of pal and secam television , recently a new technique has gained popularity , and the resulting speed and pitch of the telecined presentation are identical to that of the original film this can be accomplished by inserting a pulldown field every 12 frames , thus effectively spreading 12 frames of film over 25 fields ( or '' 12.5 frames '' ) of pal video at 23.976 frame/s , there are four frames of film for every five frames of 29.97 frame/s video : : \frac progressive scan dvd players additionally offer output at 480p by using these flags to duplicate frames rather than fields , or if the tv supports it , to play the disc back at the native 24p rate
