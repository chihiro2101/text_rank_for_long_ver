he locked exits , concealed others with draperies , and even bricked up one emergency exit to prevent customers from leaving without paying p.1 coincidentally , on the night of the fire , welansky was still recovering from a heart attack in a private room at massachusetts general hospital ( mgh ) , where some of the victims would be sent wall coverings and decorative materials had been approved on the basis of tests for ordinary ignition , which showed resistance to combustion from sources such as matches and cigarettes witnesses first saw flames in the fronds , which were just below the ceiling , immediately afterward though the lit match had been close to the same fronds where the fire was seen to have begun , the official report determined that tomaszewski 's actions could not be found to be the source of the fire , which '' will be entered into the records of this department as being of unknown origin '' in a final desperate attempt to separate the burning fronds from the fabric-covered false ceiling , the decoration was pulled away from the corner , taking with it a triangular plywood panel at the ceiling level and opening the enclosed space above the false ceiling within five minutes , flames and smoke had spread to the entire nightclub others crawled through the smoky darkness trying to find exits , all but one of which were either non-functioning or hidden in non-public areas many patrons attempted to exit through the main entrance , the same way they had entered the building 's main entrance was a single revolving door , which was rendered useless as the crowd stampeded in panic later , after fire laws had tightened , it would become illegal to have only one revolving door as a main entrance without being flanked by outward opening doors with panic bar openers attached , or have the revolving doors set up so that the doors could fold against themselves in emergency situations the cocoanut grove fire - boston fire historical society other avenues of escape were similarly useless ; side doors had been bolted shut to prevent people from leaving without paying other unlocked doors , like the ones in the broadway lounge , opened inwards , rendering them useless against the crush of people trying to escape fire officials would later testify that had the doors swung outwards , at least 300 lives could have been spared navy records document how 492 died in a deadly nightclub fire 75 years ago later , during the cleanup of the building , firefighters found several dead guests sitting in their seats with drinks in their hands they had been overcome so quickly by fire and toxic smoke that they had not had time to move however , after the blaze , jones was discovered slumped under his table severely burned , so some doubted accounts of his escape those in the employ of the establishment fared better in escaping than customers , owing to their familiarity with service areas , where the fire 's effects were less severe than in the public areas , and which provided access to additional window and door exits a double door opposite the public entryway to the main dining room was unlocked by wait staff and was soon the only functional outside exit from public areas alpert escaped out of a basement window and was credited with leading several people to safety no witness statements refer to the use of lesberg 's bass as a battering ram or its presence anywhere along the escape route coast guardsman clifford johnson went back inside the building no fewer than four times in search of his date who , unbeknownst to him , had safely escaped johnson suffered extensive third-degree burns over 55 % of his body but survived the disaster , becoming the most severely burned person ever to survive his injuries at the time he was nevertheless ostracized for much of his life because of the fire the boston fire department investigated possible causes of ignition , the rapid spread of the fire and the catastrophic loss of life its report reached no conclusion as to the initial cause of ignition , but attributed the rapid , gaseous spread of the fire to a buildup of carbon monoxide gas due to oxygen-deprived combustion in the enclosed space above the false ceiling of the melody lounge the report also documented the fire safety code violations , flammable materials and door designs that contributed to the large loss of life kenney , charles , '' did a '' mystery gas '' fuel the cocoanut grove fire ? '' firehouse , may , 1999 kenney reported that floor plans , but not the fire investigation report , showed air-conditioning condenser units near street level on the other side of a non-structural wall from the melody lounge , and that these units had been serviced since the start of the war frechtling and lanzoni described the start of the fire as a '' flash '' tomaszewski described the spread of the fire across the ceiling as like a gasoline fire witness roland sousa ( volume 2 ) stated that he was initially unconcerned about the fire because , as a regular customer of the melody lounge , he had seen the palm tree decorations ignite before and they were always quickly put out in the year that followed the fire , massachusetts and other states enacted laws for public establishments banning flammable decorations and inward-swinging exit doors , and requiring exit signs to be visible at all times ( meaning that the exit signs had to have independent sources of electricity , and be easily readable in even the thickest smoke ) the new laws also required that revolving doors used for egress must either be flanked by at least one normal , outward-swinging door , or retrofitted to permit the individual door leaves to fold flat to permit free-flowing traffic in a panic situation , and further required that no emergency exits be chained or bolted shut in such a way as to bar escape through the doors during a panic or emergency situation these later became the basis for several federal fire laws and code restrictions placed on nightclubs , theaters , banks , public buildings , and restaurants across the nation it also led to the formation of several national organizations dedicated to fire safety it was estimated that one casualty arrived at bch every eleven seconds , the greatest influx of patients to any civilian hospital in history both hospitals were unusually well-prepared , as medical facilities all along the eastern seaboard had drawn up emergency plans in preparation for attacks against the u.s the fire caught both hospitals at change of shift , so that a double complement of nursing and support staff was available , in addition to volunteers who flocked to the hospitals as word spread of the disaster because no standardized system for triage yet existed in civilian mass-casualty incident in the u.s precious minutes were initially wasted in attempts to revive those who were dead or dying , until teams were dispatched to select the living for treatment and direct the dead to be taken to temporary mortuaries one of the first administrative decisions made at mgh was to clear the general surgery ward on the sixth floor of the white building and devote it entirely to victims of the fire all victims were housed there ; strict medical isolation was maintained , and a part of the ward was set aside for dressing changes and wound care the aftermath of the fire saw the first major use of mgh 's new blood bank , one of the area 's first , established in april 1942 and stocked with 200 units of dried plasma as part of its preparations for the war in the days following the fire , twelve hundred people donated over 3,800 units of blood to the blood bank the fire led to new ways of caring for both burns and smoke inhalation in 1944 , lund and browder , drawing upon their experiences in treating cocoanut grove victims , would publish the most widely cited paper in modern burn care , '' estimation of the areas of burns '' , in which a diagram for estimating burn size would be presented thirteen survivors of the fire were also among the first humans to be treated with the new antibiotic , penicillin for decades after the fire , this address was used as a parking lot as a result of that terrible tragedy , major changes were made in the fire codes , and improvements in the treatment of burn victims , not only in boston but across the nation it was only two years after the rhythm club fire which had killed 209 '' 'complete panic ' as 233 killed in brazil nightclub fire
