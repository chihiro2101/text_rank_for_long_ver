the scottish enlightenment thinker , shows the idea that it is important to value and think well of yourself because it serves as a motivational function that enables people to explore their full potential james identified multiple dimensions of the self , with two levels of hierarchy : processes of knowing ( called the ' i-self ' ) and the resulting knowledge about the self ( the 'me-self ' ) the social self comes closest to self-esteem , comprising all characteristics recognized by others psychologists started to consider the relationship between psychotherapy and the personal satisfaction of persons with high self-esteem as useful to the field this led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem , including the reasons why people tend to feel less worthy and why people become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves this movement can be used as an example of promising evidence that psychological research can have an effect on forming public policy a leading figure of the movement , psychologist nathaniel branden , stated : '' i can not think of a single psychological problem – from anxiety and depression , to fear of intimacy or of success , to spouse battery or child molestation – that is not traced back to the problem of low self-esteem '' this committee found very small associations between low self-esteem and its assumed consequences , ultimately showing that low self-esteem is not the root of all societal problems and not as important as the committee had originally thought however , the authors of the paper that summarized the review of the literature still believe that self-esteem is an independent variable that affects major social problems many early theories suggested that self-esteem is a basic human need or motivation he described two different forms of '' esteem '' : the need for respect from others in the form of recognition , success , and admiration , and the need for self-respect in the form of self-love , self-confidence , skill , or aptitude modern theories of self-esteem explore the reasons humans are motivated to maintain a high regard for themselves sociometer theory maintains that self-esteem evolved to check one 's level of status and acceptance in ones ' social group if a subject 's answers demonstrate solid self-regard , the scale regards them as well adjusted for example , if a woman was given the self-relevant stimuli of female and mother , psychologists would measure how quickly she identified the negative word , evil , or the positive word , kind in the early years of a child 's life , parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered the main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have although studies thus far have reported only a correlation of warm , supportive parenting styles ( mainly authoritative and permissive ) with children having high self-esteem , these parenting styles could easily be thought of as having some causal effect in self-esteem development issues like the ones previously stated , can cause adolescents to doubt themselves using social comparisons , children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities these comparisons play an important role in shaping the child 's self-esteem and influence the positive or negative feelings they have about themselves as children go through adolescence , peer influence becomes much more important multiple cohort studies show that there is not a difference in the life-span trajectory of self-esteem between generations due to societal changes such as grade inflation in education or the presence of social media feelings of shame usually occur because of a situation where the social self is devalued , such as a socially evaluated poor performance a poor performance leads to higher responses of psychological states that indicate a threat to the social self namely a decrease in social self-esteem and an increase in shame there are three levels of self-evaluation development in relation to the real self , ideal self , and the dreaded self ego development stages : individuals describe their ideal and real selves in terms of traits that are based on attitudes as well as actions the dreaded self is often described as having failed to meet social expectations or as self-centered descriptions of the dreaded self focus on a failure to live up to one 's ideals or role expectations often because of real world problems this level is where individuals ' self-esteems can suffer because they do not feel as though they are living up to certain expectations this feeling will moderately affect one 's self-esteem with an even larger effect seen when individuals believe they are becoming their dreaded selves people with a healthy level of self-esteem : adapted from firmly believe in certain values and principles , and are ready to defend them even when finding opposition , feeling secure enough to modify them in light of experience consider themselves equal in dignity to others , rather than inferior or superior , while accepting differences in certain talents , personal prestige or financial standing admit and accept different internal feelings and drives , either positive or negative , revealing those drives to others only when they choose are sensitive to feelings and needs of others ; respect generally accepted social rules , and claim no right or desire to prosper at others ' expense can work toward finding solutions and voice discontent without belittling themselves or others when challenges arise a person can have high self-esteem and hold it confidently where they do not need reassurance from others to maintain their positive self-view , whereas others with defensive high self-esteem may still report positive self-evaluations on the rosenberg scale , as all high self-esteem individuals do ; however , their positive self-views are fragile and vulnerable to criticism there is a need for constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain their feelings of self-worth narcissism is a disposition people may have that represents an excessive love for one 's self individuals who score high on narcissism measures , robert raskin 's 40 item true or false test , would likely select true to such statements as '' if i ruled the world , it would be a much better place a person with low self-esteem may show some of the following characteristics : heavy self-criticism and dissatisfaction for example , if they consider that being over a certain age is an anti-feat , they define themselves with the name of their anti-feat , and say , '' i am old '' they may employ defense mechanisms , including attempting to lose at games and other competitions in order to protect their self-image by publicly dissociating themselves from a need to win , and asserting an independence from social acceptance which they may deeply desire however , no type of self-esteem is indestructible , and due to certain situations or circumstances in life , one can fall from this level into any other state of self-esteem contingent self-esteem is derived from external sources , such as what others say , one 's success or failure , one 's competence , or relationship-contingent self-esteem belief that one is '' ontologically acceptable '' is to believe that one 's acceptability is '' the way things are without contingency '' abraham maslow states that psychological health is not possible unless the essential core of the person is fundamentally accepted , loved and respected by others and by oneself self-esteem allows people to face life with more confidence , benevolence , and optimism , and thus easily reach their goals and self-actualize understanding this is fundamental , and universally beneficial , since the development of positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat other people with respect , benevolence and goodwill , thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones from the late 1970s to the early 1990s many americans assumed as a matter of course that students ' self-esteem acted as a critical factor in the grades that they earned in school , in their relationships with their peers , and in their later success in life it simply means that high self-esteem may be accomplished as a result of high academic performance due to the other variables of social interactions and life events affecting this performance : '' there seem to be only two clearly demonstrated benefits of high self-esteem.first , it increases initiative , probably because it lends confidence people with high self-esteem are more willing to act on their beliefs , to stand up for what they believe in , to approach others , to risk new undertakings '' narcissism can thus be seen as a symptom of fundamentally low self-esteem , that is , lack of love towards oneself , but often accompanied by '' an immense increase in self-esteem '' based on '' the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation instead , the narcissist emphasizes their virtues in the presence of others , just to try to convince themself that they are a valuable person and to try to stop feeling ashamed for their faults ; such '' people with unrealistically inflated self-views , which may be especially unstable and highly vulnerable to negative information ,
