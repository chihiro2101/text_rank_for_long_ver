working craft of this type include the later versions of the falmouth quay punt - and interest in this local type were taken by dixon kemp , an authority on yacht racing , in 1875 they remained prominent in handicap classes through the 1920s - with yachts like rendezvous ( built 1913 ) measuring and setting of sail it appears that the norwegian boatbuilders built specific types of craft to meet the needs of the shetland market , as these boats differed somewhat from the ones used in norway these companies are known to have existed at the start of the 18th century and yawls operated right through the 19th century , until steam power , efficient tugs and lifeboats put the last of them out of business by the start of the 20th century the royal navy often had warships anchored in yarmouth roads , so providing a lot of work additional to that from the many merchant ships that passed along the east anglian coast whilst the earlier boats had three lug-rigged masts , in common with other types of british lugger , from the middle of the 19th century the mainmast was usually dispensed with to give a dipping lug foresail and a standing lug mizzen the fastest type of beach yawl was used for taking pilots and passengers out to ships as the boat entered the water she was given a final shove with a spar large crews were needed : 25 men would be common on tacking , the foresail would be dipped behind the mast to set on the other side , and the halyard ( which was made fast at the gunwale to help support the mast ) and burton ( a moveable stay ) would be shifted to windward and hauled taught again , whilst others would be heaving bags of shingle ballast to the new windward side of the bilge if worked under oar , a yawl would have 10 or more oars a side - though the beach companies usually operated a gig in light weather if delivering or collecting a pilot , as they were faster under oars the yawl as a type of royal navy ship 's boat appeared early in the second half of the 17th century the size of an individual yawl would vary depending on the size of the ship to which she belonged - though the yawl was usually the smallest of the various boats carried the sailing rig was two-masted , typically setting identical sprit-sails
