application servers are system software upon which web applications or desktop applications run application servers consist of web server connectors , computer programming languages , runtime library , database connectors , and the administration code needed to deploy , configure , manage , and connect these components on a web host web applications are computer code which run atop application servers and are written in the language ( s ) the application server supports and call the runtime libraries and components the application server offers the application developers develop programs according to the specification of the application server technet : application server the windows application server role includes internet information services ( iis ) to provide web server support , the net framework to provide application support , asp.net to provide server side scripting , com+ for application component communication , message queuing for multithreaded processing , and the windows communication foundation ( wcf ) for application communication a mobile app server is mobile middleware that makes back-end systems accessible to mobile application to support mobile application development mobile application servers , application servers , and web servers serve similar purposes : they are pieces of middleware that connect back-end systems to the users that need to access them , but the technology in each of the three differs web servers provide the caching and scaling functionality demanded by web access and not provided by application servers mobile application servers are on a similar path the emergence of mobile devices presents the need for functionality not anticipated by the developers of traditional application server developers , and mobile application servers fill this gap
