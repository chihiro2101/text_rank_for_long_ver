one view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas ( called innate ideas ) which can be general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our perception but rather were in some sense always present most of the confusions in the way ideas arise is at least in part due to the use of the term '' idea '' to cover both the representation perceptics and the object of conceptual thought this can be always illustrated in terms of the scientific doctrines of innate ideas , '' concrete ideas versus abstraction '' , as well as '' simple ideas versus complex ideas '' plato in ancient greece was one of the earliest philosophers to provide a detailed discussion of ideas and of the thinking process ( in plato 's greek the word idea carries a rather different sense from our modern english term ) plato argued in dialogues such as the phaedo , symposium , republic , and timaeus that there is a realm of ideas or forms ( eidei ) , which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas , and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge , for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties , ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are descartes often wrote of the meaning of idea as an image or representation , often but not necessarily '' in the mind '' , which was well known in the vernacular b in his meditations on first philosophy he says , '' some of my thoughts are like images of things , and it is to these alone that the name 'idea ' properly belongs '' he sometimes maintained that ideas were innate vol 4 : 196–198 and uses of the term idea diverge from the original primary scholastic use descartes 's ideas for him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep consideration of these entities in his introduction to an essay concerning human understanding , locke defines idea as '' that term which , i think , serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks , i have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm , notion , species , or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking ; and i could not avoid frequently using it '' as john locke studied humans in his work “ an essay concerning human understanding ” he continually referenced descartes for ideas as he asked this fundamental question : “ when we are concerned with something about which we have no certain knowledge , what rules or standards should guide how confident we allow ourselves to be that our opinions are right ?
