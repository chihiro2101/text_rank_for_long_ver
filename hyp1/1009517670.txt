this population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago they appear black , but may still exhibit a spot pattern however , cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded youtube ( august 3 , 2015 ) the adult bobcat is long from the head to the base of its distinctive stubby tail , averaging ; the tail , which appears '' bobbed '' and gives the species its name , adds an adult stands about at the shoulders the cat is larger in its northern range and in open habitats a morphological size comparison study in the eastern united states found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens , suggesting differing natural selection for the sexes the sizes of bobcats ' home ranges vary significantly ; a world conservation union ( iucn ) summary of research suggests ranges from one study in kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly , and females less than half that area transient bobcats were found to have both larger ( roughly and less well-defined home ranges one study found a large variation in male range sizes , from in summer up to in winter another found that female bobcats , especially those which were reproductively active , expanded their home range in winter , but that males merely shifted their range without expanding it , which was consistent with numerous earlier studies other research in various american states has shown little or no seasonal variation given their smaller range sizes , two or more females may reside within a male 's home range in line with widely differing estimates of home range size , population density figures are divergent , from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey one study noted a dense , unhunted population in california had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female the bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food , but eats heavily when prey is abundant during lean periods , it often preys on larger animals , which it can kill and return to feed on later when these prey species exist together , as in new england , they are the primary food sources of the bobcat in the far south , the rabbits and hares are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source it has been known to kill deer or pronghorn , and sometimes to hunt elk in western north america , especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce , or when deer populations become more abundant one study in the everglades showed a large majority of kills ( 33 of 39 ) were fawns , according to the yellowstone showed a large amount of kills ( 15 of 20 ) were includes elk calves , but prey up to eight times the bobcat 's weight could be successfully taken research in maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and coyote or red fox ; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals however , other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations , with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage bobcats generally begin mating by their second summer , though females may start as early as their first year a dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times , generally from winter until early spring ; this varies by location , but most mating takes place during february and march research in texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding ; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring however seldomly , it may be killed in interspecific conflict by several larger predators or fall prey to them cougars and gray wolf can kill adult bobcats , a behavior repeatedly observed in yellowstone national park as well as elsewhere like other lynx species , bobcats probably avoid encounters with bears , in part because they are likely to lose kills to them or may rarely be attacked by them kittens may be taken by several predators , including owls ( almost entirely great horned owls ) , eagles , foxes , and bears , as well as other adult male bobcats ; when prey populations are not abundant , fewer kittens are likely to reach adulthood cannibalism has been reported ; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low , but this is very rare and does not much influence the population one study found an average infection rate of 52 % from toxoplasma gondii , but with great regional variation one mite in particular , lynxacarus morlani , has to date been found only on the bobcat the population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey ; other principal factors in the selection of habitat type include protection from severe weather , availability of resting and den sites , dense cover for hunting and escape , and freedom from disturbance the animal may appear in back yards in '' urban edge '' environments , where human development intersects with natural habitats in the 20th century , it was thought to have lost territory in the us midwest and parts of the northeast , including southern minnesota , eastern south dakota , and much of missouri , mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices by 2010 , bobcats appear to have recolonized many states , occurring in every state in the continuous 48 except delaware its population in canada is limited due to both snow depth and the presence of the canadian lynx the bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid : displacement of the canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in nova scotia , while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the canadian lynx 's range to the advantage of the bobcat the animal is regulated in all three of its range countries , and is found in a number of protected areas of the united states , its principal territory estimates from the us fish and wildlife service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the us in 1988 , with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years ; for these reasons , the u.s the bobcat also suffered population decline in new jersey at the turn of the 19th century , mainly because of commercial and agricultural developments causing habitat fragmentation ; by 1972 , the bobcat was given full legal protection , and was listed as endangered in the state in 1991 escuinipae , the subspecies found in mexico , was for a time considered endangered by the us fish and wildlife service , but was delisted in 2005 the bobcat has long been valued both for fur and sport ; it has been hunted and trapped by humans , but has maintained a high population , even in the southern united states , where it is extensively hunted regulated hunting still continues , with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause as a result , the rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter , when hunting season is generally open animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges the populations may not be declining as much as predicted , but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected stories featuring the bobcat , in many variations , are found in some indigenous cultures of north america , with parallels in south america
