the smallest is ashoroa laticosta , a relatively large animal at a body length of 168 & nbsp ; cm , while the largest species reached sizes comparable to steller 's sea cow vermeij , the rise of ocean giants : maximum body size in cenozoic marine mammals as an indicator for productivity in the pacific and atlantic oceans , published 5 july 2016.doi : 10.1098/rsbl.2016.0186 a desmostylian skull has an elongated and broadened rostrum , with the nasal opening located slightly dorsally their legs seemed to be adapted for terrestrial locomotion , while a number of other parameters confirms their aquatic nature : fossils have been found in marine strata based on a comparison of trunk and limb proportions , concluded that desmostylians were more terrestrial than aquatic and clearly fore limb-dominated swimmers , hence they were more similar to '' sea bears '' than '' sea sloths '' ( as proposed by other researchers ) however , a more recent and detailed analysis of desmostylian bone structure has revealed them to be fully aquatic , like sirenians and cetaceans , with their limbs being incapable of supporting their own weight on land in particular , later species like neoparadoxia are more specialised than previous forms , suggesting increased divergence to compete with sirenians , and sirenian diversity appears to increase with desmostylian decline the type species desmostylus hesperus was originally classified from a few teeth and vertebrae as a sirenian by , but doubts arose a decade later when more complete fossils were discovered in japan merriam , who concluded on the basis of the molar structure and repeated occurrence in marine beds that the animals had been aquatic , and were probably sirenian the discovery of a complete skeleton from sakhalin island in 1941 , however , showed that they possessed four legs , with bones as stout as a hippopotamus ' , and justified the creation of a new order for the desmostylians , described by douglas emlong 's 1971 discovery of the new genus behemotops from oregon showed that early desmostylians had more proboscidean-like teeth and jaws than later ones
