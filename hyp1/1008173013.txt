neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind , such as learning , memory , and consciousness , are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws since the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brain 's neural network , are poorly understood issues , mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulator rather than having to understand the high-level psychological processes and large-scale structures of the brain , and model them using classical artificial intelligence methods and cognitive psychology models , the low-level structure of the underlying neural network is captured , mapped and emulated with a computer system however , the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision , for example due to background noise the computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations , preferably in real time the uploaded mind may then perceive a memory loss of the events and mental processes immediately before the time of brain scanning however , as the physiological genesis of 'mind ' is not currently known , this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity operation of the brain depends on the dynamics of electrical and biochemical signal exchange between neurons ; therefore , capturing them in a single '' frozen '' state may prove insufficient in addition , the nature of these signals may require modeling down to the molecular level and beyond underlying the concept of '' mind uploading '' ( more accurately '' mind transferring '' ) is the broad philosophy that consciousness lies within the brain 's information processing and is in essence an emergent feature that arises from large neural network high-level patterns of organization , and that the same patterns of organization can be realized in other processing devices mind uploading also relies on the idea that the human mind ( the '' self '' and the long-term memory ) , just like non-human minds , is represented by the current neural network paths and the weights of the brain synapses rather than by a dualistic and mystic soul and spirit whether when my brain has lost its original structure , and when some hundred years after the same materials are fabricated so curiously as to become an intelligent being , whether , i say that being will be me ; or , if , two or three such beings should be formed out of my brain ; whether they will all be me , and consequently one and the same intelligent being ” a considerable portion of transhumanists and singularitarians place great hope into the belief that they may become immortal , by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains , thereby leaving their '' biological shell '' some have also asserted that consciousness is a part of an extra-biological system that is yet to be discovered and can not be fully understood under the present constraints of neurobiology on the contrary , numerous scientists believe consciousness may be the result of some form of quantum computation dependent on substrate ( see quantum mind ) in addition , the resulting animal emulations themselves might suffer , depending on one 's views about consciousness he then concludes : “ if , as i argue above , a sufficiently detailed computational simulation of the brain is potentially operationally equivalent to an organic brain , it follows that we must consider extending protections against suffering to simulations however , some experiments might require a fully functioning and suffering animal emulation questions also arise regarding the moral status of partial brain emulations , as well as creating neuromorphic emulations that draw inspiration from biological brains but are built somewhat differently would they be given the rights of biological humans ? if a person makes an emulated copy of themselves and then dies , does the emulation inherit their property and official positions ? could the emulation ask to '' pull the plug '' when its biological version was terminally ill or in a coma ? would it help to treat emulations as adolescents for a few years so that the biological creator would maintain temporary control ? would criminal emulations receive the death penalty , or would they be given forced data modification as a form of '' rehabilitation '' ? could an upload have marriage and child-care rights ? if simulated minds would come true and if they were assigned rights of their own , it may be difficult to ensure the protection of '' digital human rights '' for example , social science researchers might be tempted to secretly expose simulated minds , or whole isolated societies of simulated minds , to controlled experiments in which many copies of the same minds are exposed ( serially or simultaneously ) to different test conditions the neuroscience and computer-hardware technologies that may make brain emulation possible are widely desired for other reasons , and logically their development will continue into the future arguments for speeding up brain-emulation research : if neuroscience is the bottleneck on brain emulation rather than computing power , emulation advances may be more erratic and unpredictable based on when new scientific discoveries happen arguments for slowing down brain-emulation research : greater investment in brain emulation and associated cognitive science might enhance the ability of artificial intelligence ( ai ) researchers to create '' neuromorphic '' ( brain-inspired ) algorithms , such as neural networks , reinforcement learning , and hierarchical perception this was based on the idea that brain emulation would require understanding some brain components , and it would be easier to tinker with these than to reconstruct the entire brain in its original form emulation research would also speed up neuroscience as a whole , which might accelerate medical advances , cognitive enhancement , lie detectors , and capability for psychological manipulation emulations might be easier to control than de novo ai because human abilities , behavioral tendencies , and vulnerabilities are more thoroughly understood , thus control measures might be more intuitive and easier to plan for unlike ai , an emulation would n't be able to rapidly expand beyond the size of a human brain because of the postulated difficulties that a whole brain emulation-generated superintelligence would pose for the control problem , computer scientist stuart j cox , is about the eventual ( and , to the authors , almost inevitable ) evolution of computers into sentient beings , but also deals with human mind transfer mind uploading in fiction brain initiative brain transplant brain-reading cyborg cylon ( reimagining ) democratic transhumanism human brain project isolated brain neuralink posthumanization robotoid ship of theseus—thought experiment asking if objects having all parts replaced fundamentally remain the same object simulation hypothesis simulism technologically enabled telepathy turing test the future of work and death
