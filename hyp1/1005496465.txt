lotze 's early studies were mostly governed by two distinct interests : the first was scientific , based upon mathematical and physical studies under the guidance of e weisse also influenced his later anti-psychologistic approach lotze expressed these views in his 1880 article '' die philosophie in den letzten 40 jahren '' / '' philosophy in the last forty years '' ( kleine schriften , v hirzel , 1885–9 ) ; see to the historiography of philosophy lotze 's first work was his dissertation de futurae biologiae principibus philosophicis , with which he gained in july 1838 the degree of doctor of medicine in 1840 he gained the degree of doctor of philosophy with his dissertation de summis continuorum he laid the foundation of his philosophical system in his metaphysik ( leipzig , 1841 ) and his logik ( 1843 ) , short books published while still a junior lecturer at leipzig university , whence he moved to göttingen , succeeding johann friedrich herbart in the chair of philosophy he first became known to a larger circle through a series of works which aimed at establishing the study of both the physical and mental phenomena of the human organism when lotze published these works , medical science was still under the influence of schelling 's philosophy of nature these doctrines of lotze , though pronounced with the distinct and reiterated reservation that they did not contain a solution of the philosophical question regarding the nature of mechanism , were nevertheless by many considered to be the last word of the philosopher , a decisive rejection of the reveries of schelling and the idealistic theories of hegel published as they were during the years when the modern school of german materialism was at its height , these works of lotze were enrolled in the opposing camp of empiricism however , he admitted that the monadology of leibniz could be considered the forerunner of herbart 's teachings and also of his own views such a union is , for him , only intelligible through the idea of a personal deity , who in the creation and preservation of a world has voluntarily chosen certain forms and laws , through the natural operation of which the ends of his work are gained lotze 's lectures ranged over a wide field : he delivered annually lectures on psychology and on logic ( the latter including a survey of the entirety of philosophical research , encyclopädie der philosophie ) , then at longer intervals lectures on metaphysics , philosophy of nature , philosophy of art , philosophy of religion , rarely on history of philosophy and ethics in these lectures he expounded his peculiar views in a stricter form , and during the last decade of his life he embodied the substance of those courses in his system der philosophie , of which only two volumes have appeared ( vol the third and concluding volume , which was to treat in a more condensed form the principal problems of practical philosophy , of philosophy of art and religion , was not completed before his death the investigations will then naturally divide themselves into three parts , the first of which deals with those to our mind inevitable forms , or laws , in which we are obliged to think about things , if we think at all ( metaphysics ) , the second being devoted to the great region of facts , trying to apply the results of metaphysics to these , specially the two great regions of external and mental phenomena ( cosmology and psychology ) , the third dealing with those standards of value from which we pronounce our aesthetic or ethical approval or disapproval his goal was to form some general idea how laws , facts and standards of value may be combined in one comprehensive view he traced material things through our scientific discovery of them , back to the culture which gave them reality through this science , and ultimately back to the values which established this culture these manifestations of the divine spirit again can not be traced and understood by reducing ( as hegel did ) the growth of the human mind in the individual , in society and in history to the monotonous rhythm of a speculative schematism the essence and worth which is in them reveals itself only to the student of detail , for reality is larger and wider than philosophy this conviction of the emptiness of terms and abstract notions , and of the fullness of individual life , led lotze to combine in his writings the two courses into which german philosophical thought had been moving since the death of its great founder , leibniz this attempt missed the deeper meaning of leibniz 's philosophy the latter was the unsystematized philosophy of general culture which we find in the work of the great writers of the classical period , lessing , winckelmann , goethe , schiller and herder by understanding and combining the strengths of each approach , he became the true successor of leibniz google ( oxford ) system der philosophie google ( harvard ) ;
