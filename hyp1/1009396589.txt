by the seventeenth century , philosophers began to associate the question of individuation or what brings about individuality at any one time with the question of identity or what constitutes sameness at different points in time in analytical psychology , individuation is the process where the individual self develops out of an undifferentiated unconscious – seen as a developmental psychic process during which innate elements of personality , the components of the immature psyche , and the experiences of the person 's life become , if the process is more or less successful , integrated over time into a well-functioning whole from around 2016 , coinciding with increased government regulation of the collection and handling of personal data , most notably the gdpr in eu law , individuation has been used to describe the ‘ singling out ’ of a person from a crowd – a threat to privacy , autonomy and dignity doing so enables the person , at an individual level , to be tracked , profiled , targeted , contacted , or subject to a decision or action which impacts them - even if their ‘ identity ’ is not known ( or knowable ) rapid advances in technologies including artificial intelligence , and optical surveillance coupled with facial recognition systems have now altered the digital environment to such an extent that ‘ not identifiable ’ is no longer an effective proxy for ‘ will suffer no privacy harm ’ , and many data protection laws may require re-drafting to give adequate protection to privacy interests , by explicitly regulating individuation as well as identification of individuals the heisenberg 's uncertainty principle says that complementary variables , such as position and momentum , can not both be precisely known – in some sense , they are not individual variables in his view , the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different , with each of the two states having its own real physical state , independent of the state of the other '' in general , it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated from other human beings ; in particular , it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general , collective psychology thus , '' there is often a movement from dealing with the persona at the start in l'individuation psychique et collective , gilbert simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause simondon also conceived of '' pre-individual fields '' which make individuation possible furthermore , individuation always creates both an individual subject and a collective subject , which individuate themselves concurrently the essential points are the following : the i , as a psychic individual , can only be thought in relationship to we , which is a collective individual the technical system is an apparatus which has a specific role wherein all objects are inserted — a technical object exists only insofar as it is disposed within such an apparatus with other technical objects ( this is what gilbert simondon calls the technical group )
