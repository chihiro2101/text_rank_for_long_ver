from that time , briand was one of the leaders of the french socialist party '' foundations of the welfare state , 2nd edition by pat thane , published 1996 briand again served as minister of justice 1912-13 under the premiership of the rightwinger raymond poincaré ( soon to become president of france ) , before again becoming prime minister for a few months from 21 january 1913 until 22 march 1913 at the end of august 1914 , following the outbreak of the first world war , briand again became minister of justice when rené viviani reconstructed his ministry he also became foreign minister for the first time , a post held by théophile delcassé until the final weeks of the previous government 36 & 38-9 draft proposals for allied cooperation , prepared by lord esher and maurice hankey were on the table by the time british prime minister h the opening weeks of briand 's ministry required him to broker an agreement between joseph gallieni , the new war minister , and joseph joffre , newly ( 2 december ) promoted to '' commander-in-chief of the french armies '' ( generalissimo ) over all theatres apart from north africa in the poisonous atmosphere after the opening of the battle of verdun ( 21 february 1916 ) , gallieni read an angry report at the council of ministers on 7 march criticising joffre 's conduct of operations over the last eighteen months and demanding ministerial control , then resigned 285 the first formal allied conference met in paris on 26 march 1916 ( italy did not participate ) but initially made little impact , perhaps because briand had vetoed the british suggestion of a permanent secretariat , french ministers ' meetings were not then minuted , whereas in the uk at that time the prime minister had to write a report of meetings to the king , until the end of the year when formal agenda and minutes , drawn up by hankey , were introduced by lloyd george or perhaps because there had been three informal sets of anglo-french talks in the last quarter of 1915 , one of which , the chantilly meeting , had already seen strategy plans drawn up greenhalgh 2014 , p.159 briand also attended the conference at saleux on 31 may 1916 about the upcoming anglo-french offensive on the somme , with president poincaré ( on whose train it was held ) , general foch ( commander , army group north ) and the british commander-in-chief general haig greenhalgh 2005 , p.50 the first secret session of the chamber of deputies was held in june 1916 to discuss the shortcomings of the defence at verdun on 13 december briand formed a new government , reducing the size of the council of ministers from 23 to 10 and replacing roques with hubert lyautey that day his government survived a vote of confidence by 30 votes , and joffre was appointed '' general-in-chief of the french armies , technical adviser to the government , consultative member of the war committee '' ( he was persuaded to accept by briand , but soon found that he had been stripped of real power and asked to be relieved altogether on 26 december ) , with nivelle replacing him as commander-in-chief of the armies of the north and northeast doughty 2005 , p320-1 a senate secret session on 21 december attacked briand 's plans for a smaller war cabinet as '' yet another level of bureaucracy '' ; on 23 december briand pledged that he would continue to push for a '' permanent allied bureau '' to secure constant cooperation between the allied nations greenhalgh 2005 , p.137 briand 's reduced war cabinet was formed in imitation of the small executive body formed by lloyd george , just appointed prime minister of britain , but in practice briand 's often met just prior to meetings of the main cabinet briand only reluctantly agreed to attend another allied conference in london ( 12–13 march 1917 ) to resolve the matter as foreign minister briand formulated an original proposal for a new economic union of europe briand made his proposals in a speech in favor of a european union in the league of nations on 5 september 1929 , and in 1930 , in his '' memorandum on the organization of a regime of european federal union '' for the government of france the plan , under the memorandum on the organization of a system of european federal union , was in the end presented as a french initiative to the league of nations with the death of his principal supporter , german foreign minister gustav stresemann , and the onset of the great depression in 1929 , briand 's plan was never adopted but it suggested an economic framework for developments after
