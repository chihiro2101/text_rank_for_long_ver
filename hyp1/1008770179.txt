huygens had six instruments aboard that took in a wide range of scientific data as the probe descended through titan 's atmosphere with the aerodynamic properties of the probe already known , it was possible to determine the density of titan 's atmosphere and to detect wind gusts the probe was designed so that in the event of a landing on a liquid surface , its motion due to waves would also have been measurable the wind-induced horizontal motion from huygens would 've been derived from the measured doppler shift measurements , corrected for all known orbit and propagation effects the swinging motion of the probe beneath its parachute due to atmospheric properties may also have been detected measurements started above titan 's surface , where huygens was blown eastwards at more than , agreeing with earlier measurements of the winds at altitude , made over the past few years using telescopes as huygens was primarily an atmospheric mission , the disr instrument was optimized to study the radiation balance inside titan 's atmosphere aided by the slowly spinning probe they would build up a full mosaic of the landing site , which , surprisingly , became clearly visible only below altitude '' the scientific objectives of the experiment fall into four areas including ( 1 ) measurement of the solar heating profile for studies of the thermal balance of titan ; ( 2 ) imaging and spectral reflection measurements of the surface for studies of the composition , topography , and physical processes which form the surface as well as for direct measurements of the wind profile during the descent ; ( 3 ) measurements of the brightness and degree of linear polarization of scattered sunlight including the solar aureole together with measurements of the extinction optical depth of the aerosols as a function of wavelength and altitude to study the size , shape , vertical distribution , optical properties , sources and sinks of aerosols in titan â€™ s atmosphere ; and ( 4 ) measurements of the spectrum of downward solar flux to study the composition of the atmosphere , especially the mixing ratio profile of methane throughout the descent this investigation was made possible by heating the gc/ms instrument just prior to impact in order to vaporize the surface material upon contact the ssp contained a number of sensors designed to determine the physical properties of titan 's surface at the point of impact , whether the surface was solid or liquid an acoustic sonar , activated during the last of the descent , continuously determined the distance to the surface , measuring the rate of descent and the surface roughness ( e.g the instrument was designed so that if the surface were liquid , the sounder would measure the speed of sound in the '' ocean '' and possibly also the subsurface structure ( depth ) a tilt sensor measured pendulum motion during the descent and was also designed to indicate the probe 's attitude after landing and show any motion due to waves long after launch , a few persistent engineers discovered that the communication equipment on cassini had a potentially fatal design flaw , which would have caused the loss of all data transmitted by huygens since huygens was too small to transmit directly to earth , it was designed to transmit the telemetry data obtained while descending through titan 's atmosphere to cassini by radio , which would in turn relay it to earth using its large diameter main antenna in early 2000 , he sent simulated telemetry data at varying power and doppler shift levels from earth to cassini this was because under the original flight plan , when huygens was to descend to titan , it would have accelerated relative to cassini , causing the doppler shift of its signal to vary channel a was the sole path for an experiment to measure wind speeds by studying tiny frequency changes caused by huygens ' s motion doppler radio measurements of huygens from earth were made , although they were not as accurate as the lost measurements that cassini made the use of accelerometer sensors on huygens and vlbi tracking of the position of the huygens probe from earth allowed reasonably accurate wind speed and direction calculations to be made
