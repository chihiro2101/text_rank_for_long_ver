despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor gh release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides , which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators ( e.g a number of factors are known to affect gh secretion , such as age , sex , diet , exercise , stress , and other hormones effects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as anabolic ( building up ) increased height during childhood is the most widely known effect of gh additional igf-1 is generated within target tissues , making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone in addition to increasing height in children and adolescents , growth hormone has many other effects on the body : increases calcium retention , and strengthens and increases the mineralization of bone increases muscle mass through sarcomere hypertrophy promotes lipolysis increases protein synthesis stimulates the growth of all internal organs excluding the brain plays a role in homeostasis reduces liver uptake of glucose promotes gluconeogenesis in the liver contributes to the maintenance and function of pancreatic islets stimulates the immune system increases deiodination of t4 to t3 t.f carpal tunnel syndrome ) , muscle weakness , excess sex hormone-binding globulin ( shbg ) , insulin resistance or even a rare form of type 2 diabetes , and reduced sexual function in some circumstances , focused radiation or a gh antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function the effects of growth hormone deficiency vary depending on the age at which they occur alterations in somatomedin can result in growth hormone deficiency with two known mechanisms ; failure of tissues to respond to somatomedin , or failure of the liver to produce somatomedin major manifestations of gh deficiency in children are growth failure , the development of a short stature , and delayed sexual maturity adults with ghd '' tend to have a relative increase in fat mass and a relative decrease in muscle mass and , in many instances , decreased energy and quality of life '' diagnosis of gh deficiency involves a multiple-step diagnostic process , usually culminating in gh stimulation tests to see if the patient 's pituitary gland will release a pulse of gh when provoked by various stimuli several studies , primarily involving patients with gh deficiency , have suggested a crucial role of gh in both mental and emotional well-being and maintaining a high energy level gh is used as replacement therapy in adults with gh deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset ( usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor ) in these patients , benefits have variably included reduced fat mass , increased lean mass , increased bone density , improved lipid profile , reduced cardiovascular risk factors , and improved psychosocial well-being gh can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in gh higher ( '' pharmacologic '' ) doses are required to produce significant acceleration of growth in these conditions , producing blood levels well above normal ( '' physiologic '' ) one version of rhgh has also been fda approved for maintaining muscle mass in wasting due to aids dea : genotropin quote : '' the illicit distribution of hgh occurs as the result of physicians illegally prescribing it for off-label uses , and for the treatment of fda-approved medical conditions without examination and supervision '' claims for gh as an anti-aging treatment date back to 1990 when the new england journal of medicine published a study wherein gh was used to treat 12 men over 60 a stanford university school of medicine meta-analysis of clinical studies on the subject published in early 2007 showed that the application of gh on healthy elderly patients increased muscle by about 2 & nbsp ; kg and decreased body fat by the same amount researchers also did not discover any gain in muscle strength , which led them to believe that gh merely let the body store more water in the muscles rather than increase muscle growth sales are limited by law to treat a rare growth defect in children and a handful of uncommon conditions like short bowel syndrome or prader-willi syndrome , a congenital disease that causes reduced muscle tone and a lack of hormones in sex glands in some cases , the patient can produce an immune response against gh one survey of adults that had been treated with replacement cadaver gh ( which has not been used anywhere in the world since 1985 ) during childhood showed a mildly increased incidence of colon cancer and prostate cancer , but linkage with the gh treatment was not established the study published in 1957 , which was conducted on '' a 13-year-old male with well-documented hypopituitarism secondary to a crainiophyaryngioma , '' found that : '' human and monkey growth hormone resulted in a significant enhancement of nitrogen storage & nbsp ; impairment of the glucose tolerance curve was evident after 10 days of administration of the human growth hormone in 1985 , biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the u.s
