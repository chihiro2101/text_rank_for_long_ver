the fundamental results the researchers obtained established computable function as the correct formalization of the informal idea of effective calculation nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis , the church–turing thesis , which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function with a definition of effective calculation came the first proofs that there are problems in mathematics that can not be effectively decided extending this result , pyotr novikov and william boone showed independently in the 1950s that the word problem for groups is not effectively solvable : there is no effective procedure that , given a word in a finitely presented group , will decide whether the element represented by the word is the identity element of the group a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set ( also called a decidable , recursive , or turing computable set ) if there is a turing machine that , given a number n , halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine the existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countable set turing machines , and thus only countably many computable sets , but according to the cantor 's theorem , there are uncountable set sets of natural numbers beginning with the theory of recursive sets and functions described above , the field of recursion theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics the natural examples of sets that are not computable , including many different sets that encode variants of the halting problem , have two properties in common : they are recursively enumerable , and each can be translated into any other via a many-one reduction that is , given such sets a and b , there is a total computable function f such that a has the property that either the halting problem or its complement is many-one reducible to e , that is , can be mapped using a many-one reduction to e ( see rice 's theorem for more detail ) : for further explanation , see the section post 's problem and the priority method in the article turing degree post 's problem was solved with a method called the priority method ; a proof using this method is called a priority argument to use this method , the desired properties of the set to be constructed are broken up into an infinite list of goals , known as requirements , so that satisfying all the requirements will cause the set constructed to have the desired properties for example , kummer published a paper on a proof for the existence of friedberg numberings without using the priority method when post defined the notion of a simple set as an r.e post 's original motivation in the study of this lattice was to find a structural notion such that every set which satisfies this property is neither in the turing degree of the recursive sets nor in the turing degree of the halting problem harrington gave a further example of an automorphic property : that of the creative sets , the sets which are many-one equivalent to the halting problem this approach revolutionized earlier ways to determine when an infinite sequence ( equivalently , characteristic function of a subset of the natural numbers ) is random or not by invoking a notion of randomness for finite objects on the other hand , jockusch 's semirecursive sets ( which were already known informally before jockusch introduced them 1968 ) are examples of a set which is ( m , & nbsp ; n ) -recursive if and only if 2m & nbsp ; \pi^1_1 of the analytical hierarchy there are close relationships between the turing degree of a set of natural numbers and the difficulty ( in terms of the arithmetical hierarchy ) of defining that set using a first-order logic gödel 's proofs show that the set of logical consequences of an effective first-order theory is a recursively enumerable set , and that if the theory is strong enough this set will be uncomputable recursion theory is also linked to second order arithmetic , a formal theory of natural numbers and sets of natural numbers the fact that certain sets are computable or relatively computable often implies that these sets can be defined in weak subsystems of second order arithmetic the program of reverse mathematics uses these subsystems to measure the noncomputability inherent in well known mathematical theorems one method of classifying the strength of these weak systems is by characterizing which computable functions the system can prove to be total ( see fairtlough and wainer ( 1998 ) ) these researchers also use terminology such as partial computable function and computably enumerable ( c.e rogers ( 1967 ) has suggested that a key property of recursion theory is that its results and structures should be invariant under computable bijections on the natural numbers ( this suggestion draws on the ideas of the erlangen program in geometry ) the idea is that a computable bijection merely renames numbers in a set , rather than indicating any structure in the set , much as a rotation of the euclidean plane does not change any geometric aspect of lines drawn on it according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers
