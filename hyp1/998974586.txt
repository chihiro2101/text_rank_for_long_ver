students at the cotes–whiston experimental philosophy course included stephen hales , william stukeley , and joseph wasse in 1707 whiston was boyle lecturer ; this lecture series was at the period a significant opportunity for newton 's followers , including richard bentley and samuel clarke , to express their views , especially in opposition to the rise of deism the '' newtonian '' line came to include , with bentley , clarke and whiston in particular , a defence of natural law by returning to the definition of augustine of hippo of a miracle ( a cause of human wonderment ) , rather than the prevailing concept of a divine intervention against nature , which went back to anselm one reason prophecy was topical was the camisard movement that saw french exiles ( '' french prophets '' ) in england whiston had started writing on the millenarianism that was integral to the newtonian theology , and wanted to distance his views from theirs , and in particular from those of john lacy meeting the french prophets in 1713 , whiston developed the view that the charismatic gift of revelation could be demonic possession one view is that the relationship was never very close , bentley being more involved in whiston 's appointment to the lucasian chair ; and that it deteriorated as soon as whiston began to write on prophecy , publishing essay on the revelation of st john ( 1706 ) newton himself was heavily if covertly involved in the 1722 edition , nominally due to john machin , making many changes there is evidence from hopton haynes that newton reacted by pulling back from publication on the issue ; his antitrinitarian views , from the 1690s , were finally published in 1754 as an historical account of two notable corruptions of scripture whiston 's route to rejection of the nicene creed , the historical orthodox position against arianism , began early in his tenure of the lucasian chair as he followed hints from samuel clarke the party passions of these years found an echo in henry sacheverell 's attempt to exclude whiston from his church of st andrew 's , holborn , taking place in 1719 franz wokenius wrote a 1728 latin work on whiston 's view of primitive christianity his dislike of rationalism in religion also made him one of the numerous opponents of hoadley 's plain account of the nature and end of the sacrament his passing remarks on religious topics were sometimes objected to , for example by henry newman writing to steele for the next forty years he continued to propose a range of methods to solve the longitude prize , which earned him widespread ridicule , particularly from the group of writers known as the scriblerians the work obtained the praise of john locke , who classed the author among those who , if not adding much to our knowledge , '' at least bring some new things to our thoughts there was no consensus within the newtonians as to how far mechanical causes could be held responsible for key events of sacred history : john keill was at the opposite extreme to whiston in minimising such causes he picked up on arthur ashley sykes 's advice to samuel clarke to omit an eclipse and earthquake mentioned by phlegon of tralles from future editions of clarke 's boyle lectures , these events being possibly synchronous with christ 's crucifixion westfall absolves whiston of the charge that he pushed for the posthumous publication of the chronology just to attack it , commenting that the heirs were in any case looking to publish manuscripts of newton , who died in 1727 his last '' famous discovery , or rather revival of dr giles fletcher , the elder 's , '' which he mentions in his autobiography , was the identification of the tatars with the lost tribes of israel whiston 's later life was spent in continual controversy : theology , mathematical , chronology , and miscellaneous in 1727 he published a two volume work called authentik record belonging to the old and new testament these do not contain the account of the proceedings taken against him at cambridge for his antitrinitarianism , which was published separately at the time & nbsp ; 1070–1082 '' the works of flavius josephus '' translated by william whiston '' william whiston and the deluge '' by immanuel velikovsky '' whiston 's flood '' whiston biography at chambers ' book of days some of whiston 's views on biblical prophecy '' william whiston , the universal deluge , and a terrible specracle '' by roomet jakapi collection of authentick records by whiston at the newton project william whiston , 1667–1752 collection of william whiston portraits at england 's national portrait gallery primitive new testament william whiston & 124 ; portraits from the past a new theory of the earth ( 1696 ) – full digital facsimile at linda hall library
