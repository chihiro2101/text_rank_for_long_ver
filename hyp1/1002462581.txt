coevolution is the evolution of two or more species which reciprocally affect each other , sometimes creating a mutualism ( biology ) between the species he first mentioned coevolution as a possibility in on the origin of species , and developed the concept further in fertilisation of orchids ( 1862 ) at least three aspects of flowers appear to have coevolved between flowering plants and insects , because they involve communication between these organisms firstly , flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent ; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is , to approach it , and to identify where to land and finally to feed the floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species it is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first , and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time there is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence : from ornithophily to insect pollination ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter in penstemon , flower traits that discourage bee pollination may be more influential on the flowers ' evolutionary change than 'pro-bird ' adaptations , but adaptation 'towards ' birds and 'away ' from bees can happen simultaneously these flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds this allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird 's body , permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations such mutualism is not automatic : other ant species exploit trees without reciprocating , following different evolutionary strategy these cheater ants impose important host costs via damage to tree reproductive organs , though their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and , thus , becomes difficult to forecast correlated mutations between the two species enter them into an evolution arms race it seems that when a parasite infects a host , sexual reproduction affords a better chance of developing resistance ( through variation in the next generation ) , giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction , which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations , including blood-plasma polymorphism , protein polymorphism , and histocompatibility systems these birds do not make their own nests , but lay their eggs in nests of other species , ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong negative impact on the host 's reproductive fitness while there is no genetic exchange between the species , they are unable to evolve in a direction where they become too genetically different as this would make crossbreeding impossible the types of coevolution listed so far have been described as if they operated pairwise ( also called specific coevolution ) , in which traits of one species have evolved in direct response to traits of a second species , and vice versa another evolutionary mode arises where evolution is still reciprocal , but is among a group of species rather than exactly two for instance , a trait in several species of flowering plant , such as offering its nectar at the end of a long tube , can coevolve with a trait in one or several species of pollinating insects , such as a long proboscis thompson ( as a way of linking the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape interactions among species across ecosystems it is based on three observations that are taken as assumptions : ( 1 ) species are usually groups of populations that are somewhat genetically distinct from each other , ( 2 ) interacting species often co-occur in only parts of their geographic ranges , and ( 3 ) interactions among species differ ecologically among environments from these assumptions , geographic mosaic theory suggests that natural selection on interactions among species is driven by three sources of variation : 1 geographic selection mosaics occur in interactions among species , because genes are expressed in different ways in different environments and because different genes are favored in different environments for example , natural selection on an interaction between a parasite population and a host population may differ between very dry environments and very wet environments coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots occur because natural selection on interactions among species is reciprocal in some environments but not in others for example , a symbiont population may decrease the survival or reproduction of its hosts in one environment , but it may have no effect on host survival or reproduction in another environment at any moment in time , a local population will have a unique combination of genes on which natural selection acts , whole genome duplications ) , gene flow among populations from individuals arriving from other populations or going to other populations , random loss or fixation of genes at times when populations are small ( random genetic drift ) , hybridization with other species , and other genetic and ecological processes that affect the raw genetic material on which natural selection acts
