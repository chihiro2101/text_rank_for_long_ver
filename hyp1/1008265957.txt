pupils were usually educated in grammar schools up to the age of 14 , after which they would look to universities and the church for further study three of the first schools independent of the church – winchester college ( 1382 ) , oswestry school ( 1407 ) and eton college ( 1440 ) – were closely tied to the universities ; they were boarding schools , so they could educate pupils from anywhere in the nation in england , urban middle-class pressure for a commercial curriculum was often supported by the school 's trustees ( who would charge the new students fees ) , but resisted by the schoolmaster , supported by the terms of the original endowment however it should be borne in mind that the decline of the grammar schools in england and wales was not uniform and that until the foundation of st bees clerical college , in 1817 , and st david 's college lampeter , in 1828 , specialist grammar schools in the north-west of england and south wales were in effect providing tertiary education to men in their late teens and early twenties , which enabled them to be ordained as anglican clergymen without going to university at the same time , the national schools were reorganising themselves along the lines of thomas arnold 's reforms at rugby school , and the spread of the railways led to new boarding schools teaching a broader curriculum , such as marlborough college ( 1843 ) grammar schools thus emerged as one part of the highly varied education system of england and wales before 1944 the 1944 education act created the first nationwide system of state-funded secondary education in england and wales , echoed by the education ( northern ireland ) act 1947 one of the three types of school forming the tripartite system was called the grammar school , which sought to spread the academic ethos of the existing grammar schools two types of grammar schools existed under the system : there were more than 1,200 maintained grammar schools , which were fully state-funded there were also 179 direct-grant grammar schools , which took between one quarter and one-half of their pupils from the state system , and the rest from fee-paying parents these schools included some very old schools encouraged to participate in the tripartite system grammar school pupils were given the best opportunities of any schoolchildren in the state system in contrast , very few students at secondary modern schools took public examinations until the introduction of the less academic and less prestigious certificate of secondary education ( known as the cse ) in the 1960s according to anthony sampson , in his book anatomy of britain ( 1965 ) , there were structural problems within the testing process that underpinned the eleven plus which meant it tended to result in secondary modern schools being overwhelmingly dominated by the children of poor and working-class parents , while grammar schools were dominated by the children of wealthier middle-class parents most maintained grammar schools were amalgamated with a number of other local schools , to form neighbourhood comprehensive schools , though a few were closed while many former grammar schools ceased to be selective , many of these also retained the name '' grammar '' the tripartite system of grammar and secondary modern schools does survive in a few areas , such as kent , where the eleven-plus examination to divide children into grammar and secondary modern schools is known as the kent test current british grammar schools today , '' grammar school '' commonly refers to one of the 163 remaining fully selective state-funded schools in england and the 69 remaining in northern ireland comprehensive future campaign for state education a university college london study has shown

only a few areas have kept a formal grammar school system along the lines of the tripartite system many grammar schools have featured in these programmes , and a lower level of selection is permitted at specialist schools as a result , northern ireland still maintains the grammar school system , with many pupils being entered for academic selection exams similar to the 11-plus the grammar schools have organised groupings to run their own tests , the post-primary transfer consortium ( mostly catholic schools ) and the association for quality education the northern ireland commission for catholic education has accepted continued selection at catholic grammar schools as a temporary measure , but wishes them to end the practice by 2012 these schools took their inspiration from english public schools , and often called themselves '' grammar schools '' beginning with ipswich grammar school ( 1863 ) , ten schools were founded , of which eight still exist throughout the country , '' grammar schools '' are generally high-cost private schools after several abortive attempts to raise funding , the district schools act of 1807 provided support for one grammar school teacher in each district ( of which there were then eight ) , but they were then left to their own devices the schools became more independent of the church of england , and also began to admit girls however , his efforts to convert the schools into classical schools for only boys were unsuccessful others are among the many former fee-paying schools absorbed into larger state-funded community schools founded
