after three years ( 1899 ) , his father , who desired a military career for him , had him transferred to the military high school in iaşi where he required four additional years to complete high-school coandă graduated as an artillery officer , but he was more interested in the technical problems of flight one year later ( 1910 ) he graduated at the head of the first class of aerospace engineering in 1910 , in the workshop of gianni caproni , he designed and built an aircraft known as the coandă-1910 , which he displayed publicly at the second international aeronautic salon in paris that year years later , after others had developed jet technology , coandă started making claims that it was a motorjet , and that it actually flew according to charles gibbs-smith : '' there was never any idea of injecting fuel ; the machine never flew ; it was never destroyed on test ; and flight noted that it was sold to a monsieur weyman harry stine—a rocket scientist , author and '' the father of american model rocketry '' —stated in his book the hopeful future that '' there were several jet-propelled aircraft in existence at an early time-the coandă-1910 jet and the 1938 caproni campini n.1 , the pure jet aircraft flight was made in germany in 1938 '' between 1911 and 1914 , he worked as technical manager of the bristol aeroplane company in the united kingdom , where he designed several aeroplanes known as the bristol-coanda monoplanes in 1912 one of these aircraft won a prize at the british military aeroplane competition in 1915 , he returned to france where , working during world war i for delaunay-belleville in saint-denis , he designed and built three different models of propeller aeroplane , including the coandă-1916 , with two propellers mounted close to the tail coanda spent world war ii in occupied france where he worked for the nazis to help their war effort by developing the turbopropulseur ( turbopropeller ) drive system from his 1910 biplane into a propulsion system for snow sleds in 1969 , during the early years of the ceauşescu era , he returned to spend his last days in his native romania , where he served as director of the institute for scientific and technical creation ( increst ) and in 1971 reorganized , along with professor elie carafoli , the department of aeronautical engineering of the polytechnic university of bucharest , spinning it off from the department of mechanical engineering after more than 20 years studying this phenomenon along with his colleagues , coandă described what albert metral was later to name the '' coandă effect ''
