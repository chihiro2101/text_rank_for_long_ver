( archive ) the preparation of sulfuric acid ( 'oil of vitriol ' ) by the distillation of green vitriol ( iron ( ii ) sulfate ) has been known for at least 700 years ferrous sulfate was used in the manufacture of inks , most notably iron gall ink , which was used from the middle ages until the end of the eighteenth century harewood , a material used in marquetry and parquetry since the 17th century , is also made using ferrous sulfate iron ( ii ) sulfate is sold as ferrous sulfate , a soil amendment for lowering the ph of a high alkaline soil so that plants can access the soil 's nutrients it is used as a traditional method of treating wood panelling on houses , either alone , dissolved in water , or as a component of water-based paint it is one of the key ingredients in iron gall ink iron ( ii ) sulfate can be found in various states of hydrate , and several of these forms exist in nature numerous other , more complex ( either basic , hydrated , and/or containing additional cations ) fe ( ii ) -bearing sulfates exist in such environments , with copiapite being a good and common example this treatment produces large quantities of iron ( ii ) sulfate as a by-product : fe + h 2 so 4 â†’ feso 4 + h 2 another source of large amounts results from the production of titanium dioxide from ilmenite via the sulfate process on heating , iron ( ii ) sulfate first loses its water of crystallization and the original green crystals are converted into a white colored anhydrous solid
