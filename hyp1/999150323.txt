it is usual for hydrometers to be used with dense liquids to have the mark 1.000 ( for water ) near the top of the stem , and those for use with lighter liquids to have 1.000 near the bottom modern hydrometers usually measure specific gravity but different scales were ( and sometimes still are ) used in certain industries baum√© scale , formerly used in industrial chemistry and pharmacology brix scale , primarily used in fruit juice , wine making and the sugar industry oechsle scale , used for measuring the density of grape must plato scale , primarily used in brewing twaddell scale , formerly used in the bleaching and dyeing industries certain assumptions are made to estimate the amount of alcohol present in the fluid alcoholometers have scales marked with volume percents of '' potential alcohol '' , based on a pre-calculated specific gravity a higher '' potential alcohol '' reading on this scale is caused by a greater specific gravity , assumed to be caused by the introduction of dissolved sugars or carbohydrate based material the specific gravity of milk does not give a conclusive indication of its composition since milk contains a variety of substances that are either heavier or lighter than water a saccharometer is a hydrometer used for determining the amount of sugar in a solution , invented by thomas thomson the sugar level can be determined by reading the value where the surface of the liquid crosses the scale for measuring the density of petroleum products , such as fuel oils , the specimen is usually heated in a temperature jacket with a thermometer placed behind it since density is dependent on temperature very light oils with many volatile components are measured in a variable volume container using a floating piston sampling device to minimize light end losses a hydrometer calibrated to read specific gravity relative to water at is a standard tool for servicing car battery another automotive use of hydrometers is testing the quality of the antifreeze solution used for engine cooling the degree of freeze protection can be related to the density ( and so concentration ) of the antifreeze ; different types of antifreeze have different relations between measured density and freezing point as urine 's specific gravity is dictated by its ratio of solutes ( wastes ) to water , a urinometer makes it possible to quickly assess a patient 's overall level of hydration
