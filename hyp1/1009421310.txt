in the catholic church , the bishop who is head of a particular autonomous church , known in canon law as a church sui iuris , is ordinarily a patriarch , though this responsibility can be entrusted to a major archbishop , metropolitan , or other prelate for a number of serious reasons since the council of nicaea , the bishop of rome has been recognized as the first among patriarchs that council designated three bishops with this 'supra-metropolitan ' title : rome , alexandria , and antioch there were at the time bishops of other apostolic sees that operated with patriarchal authority beyond the borders of the roman empire , such as the catholicos of selucia-ctesephon four more of the eastern catholic churches are headed by a prelate known as a '' major archbishop , '' a title essentially equivalent to that of patriarch and originally created by pope paul vi in 1963 for josyf slipyj : the major archbishop of kyiv-halych and head of the ukrainian greek catholic church the major archbishop of ernakulam-angamaly and head of the syro-malabar catholic church the major archbishop of trivandrum and head of the syro-malankara catholic church the major archbishop of făgăraş and alba iulia and head of the romanian greek catholic church within their proper sui iuris churches there is no difference between patriarchs and major archbishops 76 an example of the petition and the granting of ecclesiastical communion : furthermore , patriarchs who are created cardinals form part of the order of cardinal bishops , whereas major archbishops are only created cardinal priests they take precedence after the heads of autonomous churches in full communion , whether pope , patriarch , or major archbishop in theological and other scholarly literature of the early modern period , the title '' patriarch of the west '' ( latin : patriarcha occidentis ; greek : πατριάρχης τῆς δύσεως ) was mainly used as designation for the jurisdiction of the bishop of rome over the latin church in the west this was done without historical precedent or theological justification : there was no ecclesiastical office as such , except occasionally as a truism : the patriarch of rome , for the latin church , was the only patriarch , and the only apostolic see , in the '' west '' during the synod of bishops on the middle east in 2009 , pope benedict xvi appeared , as patriarch of the latin church , with the other patriarchs , but without the latin patriarch of jerusalem , though he was present at the same synod the title of '' patriarch '' is assumed also by the leaders of certain relatively recent groups , who are in communion with none of the historic christian churches many , but not necessarily all such patriarchs are church leaders of the independent catholic churches : ; independent catholic the patriarch of the brazilian catholic apostolic church in brazil ( not officially used , but described in a similarly holy level ) current and former patriarchates of the catholic church ( gcatholic ) current titular patriarchal sees of the catholic church ( gcatholic ) current patriarchates of the catholic church ( gcatholic )
