frederick was related to almost all of the ruling families of the holy roman empire and a number of diplomats and dignitaries attended his baptism at amberg on 6 october 1596 during his time at sedan , frederick was a frequent visitor to the court of henry iv of france under the terms of the golden bull of 1356 , frederick 's closest male relative would serve as his guardian and as regent of the palatinate until frederick reached the age of majority in 1613 , matthias , holy roman emperor intervened in the dispute , with the result being that frederick v was able to begin his personal rule in the palatinate even though he was still underage frederick iv 's marriage policy had been designed to solidify the palatinate 's position within the reformed camp in europe james had initially considered marrying elizabeth to louis xiii of france , but these plans were rejected by his advisors frederick 's advisors in the palatinate were worried that if elizabeth were married to a catholic prince , this would upset the confessional balance of europe , and they were thus resolved that she should marry frederick v frederick and elizabeth , who had previously corresponded in french , now met each other for the first time , and got on well together on their return trip to heidelberg , frederick and elizabeth travelled to the hague to visit maurice of nassau , prince of orange before leaving for germany on 5 may 1613 one of frederick 's first acts upon taking the reins of government was attendance at a meeting of the protestant union , during which he was struck by fever and nearly died as such , frederick transferred much responsibility to his chancellor , christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg since 1526 , the kings of bohemia had all been members of the house of habsburg ; since 1555 , these kings had also been emperors thus , a substantial opposition movement developed to the rule of emperor rudolf ii yet in the latter year there was discussion within the protestant union about fielding a protestant candidate to supplant matthias as king of bohemia , and frederick 's name was discussed in this regard strategists in the palatinate believed that if frederick became king , this would lead john george i , elector of saxony , to break his alliance with the habsburgs and come fully to the protestant cause image : christian i anhalt bernburg.jpg thumb left frederick 's chancellor christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg ( 1568–1630 ) the protestants claimed the status of these lands fell under the term '' royal land '' , and thus were subject to bohemia 's authority by the letter of majesty – a very disputed legal interpretation which the habsburg government rejected in these circumstances christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg , frederick v 's governor of the upper palatinate , moved to intervene in bohemia frederick did not publicly break with the emperor , but in a letter to his father-in-law , james i of england , he placed the blame for the bohemian vote on the jesuits and the spanish party at the habsburg court the first mention in prague of frederick 's name as a possible candidate as king of bohemia came in november 1618 image : justus sustermans 028.jpg thumb right ferdinand ii , holy roman emperor ( 1578–1637 ) , who was elected king of bohemia in 1617 and who would later claim that frederick had usurped his rightful claim to the throne of bohemia fearing an invasion by imperial forces , the estates sought an alliance with the other members of the lands of the bohemian crown ( silesia , lusatia , moravia ) and on 31 july 1619 at prague , these states formed the bohemian confederacy , dedicated to opposing the habsburgs ; under the terms of this agreement , protestantism became virtually the state religion of the bohemian lands ferdinand of bavaria , archbishop of cologne predicted this decision would lead to twenty , forty , or sixty years of war this left frederick as the most senior protestant prince available , since no one else was willing to risk conflict with the emperor in august 1619 , the chances of frederick becoming king of bohemia became greater when gabriel bethlen launched an anti-habsburg revolt in royal hungary on 26 august 1619 , the states of the bohemian confederacy elected frederick as the new king of bohemia , frederick receiving news of his election on 29 august in amberg 134 two days later , ferdinand ii was elected holy roman emperor the electoral college also condemned the bohemian confederation 's attempt to remove ferdinand from the throne of bohemia and declared that the 1617 vote of the estates of bohemia , making ferdinand king of bohemia , was binding left frederick 's decision to accept the bohemian crown has been the subject of much historical speculation later catholic propaganda , in a view accepted by friedrich schiller , portrayed the decision as based mainly on elizabeth stuart 's desire to be a queen friedrich schiller : geschichte des 30jährigen kriegs , teil 1 more recently , historians have concluded that frederick 's decision was based primarily on a sense of duty to his fellow protestants , although frederick wavered between his obligations to the emperor and his commitment to his religious brethren christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg , told frederick that a union of the two areas could be commercially advantageous other possible allies – the dutch republic , charles emmanuel i , duke of savoy , and the republic of venice – sent letters saying they would not be able to offer frederick assistance if he accepted the bohemian offer between 24 september and 28 , frederick reached his decision '' not to resist the will of the almighty '' and thus decided to accept the bohemian crown in prague , frederick soon came to be alienated from a portion of the nobility and the clergy further alienation was caused by frederick v 's court preacher , abraham scultetus , who was determined to use his new post to advance the cause of calvinism in bohemia frederick 's propagandists attempted to respond to the phrase by arguing that frederick was in fact a '' winter lion '' who defended the crown of bohemia against troublemakers and liars , and that he would also be a '' summer lion this treaty provided that maximilian would be commander of the forces against frederick , promised that maximilian would retain all of the occupied bohemian lands for himself , and that he would be granted frederick 's electoral title as well the emperor was also able to obtain the support of elector john george i of saxony ; john george 's court preacher , matthias hoe von hoenegg , encouraged the emperor to smash frederick and the bohemians he argued that he had not broken the public peace because bohemia was located outside of the holy roman empire and there was not , therefore , a conflict between an imperial prince and the emperor this meeting , which included john george of saxony and maximilian of bavaria , rejected frederick 's argument , finding that bohemia was an indivisible part of the empire on 1 april 1620 , the imperial party issued an ultimatum calling on frederick to leave bohemia by 1 june a little later , john george of saxony signed a treaty with ferdinand in which ferdinand guaranteed the practice of lutheranism in bohemia and recognized the secular areas in the netherlands ferdinand also agreed to give john george lusatia , thus cementing john george 's dominance of the upper saxon circle worst of all for frederick , on 3 july 1620 , the protestant union signed the treaty of ulm ( 1620 ) , thereby withdrawing their support for frederick and declaring neutrality in the conflict between frederick and the catholic league after a series of skirmishes , on 5 november 1620 , frederick drew his forces back towards prague and imperial troops followed them when , on 8 november 1620 , frederick wanted to ride back to the troops , he was met at the gates of prague by fleeing soldiers of his army and his chancellor , anhalt , who informed him of the disaster : the bohemian army had received a crushing defeat that morning in the battle of white mountain from silesia , frederick wanted to plan revenge for the battle of white mountain , but the silesian estates refused to support this project , and he was forced to leave silesia in early 1621 on 6 february 1621 , representatives of the protestant union met with ferdinand at heilbronn to protest , but they soon agreed to support the settlement in the palatinate , and the palatinate remained occupied by spanish troops afterwards , the heads of twelve nobles , along with the hand of joachim andreas von schlick , were nailed to the old town tower of charles bridge , where they remained for ten years in summer 1621 , john ii , count palatine of zweibrücken , frederick 's former guardian who had served as regent of the electoral palatinate when frederick left for prague , resigned in late 1622 and early 1623 , frederick organised a palatinate government-in-exile at the hague frederick held out some hope that his lands might be retaken militarily , but these hopes were crushed on 27 august 1626 , when the forces of christian iv of denmark were crushed by tilly at the battle of lutter in march 1631 , frederick despatched diplomat sir robert anstruther to hold discussions with ernst egon viii , count of fürstenberg , president of the imperial privy council , about restoring frederick 's lands , but frederick died before these could bear any fruit frederick subsequently took part in gustavus adolphus ' march into the duchy of bavaria , and was present for the march into munich on 17 may 1632 unfortunately for frederick , it was too late it is believed that ludwig philipp of pfalz-simmern-kaiserslautern transferred frederick 's body to the sedan in september 1637 , but frederick 's final resting place is unknown he married elizabeth stuart , the daughter of james vi of scotland and i of england and of anne of denmark in the chapel royal , whitehall on 14 february 1613 and had the following children : frederick henry ( 1614–1629 ) — ( drowned ) charles louis ( 1617–1680 ) , became elector palatine in 1648 elisabeth ( 1618–1680 ) rupert ( 1619–1682 ) of english civil war fame maurice ( 1620–1652 ) who also served in the english civil war her son became king george i of great britain in 1714
