thorndike ’ s ‘ law of effect ’ contained the core elements of what would become known as operant conditioning an operant conditioning chamber permits experimenters to study behavior conditioning ( training ) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions ( like pressing a lever ) in response to specific stimuli , such as a light or sound signal when the subject correctly performs the behavior , the chamber mechanism delivers food or other reward operant chambers have at least one operandum ( or '' manipulandum '' ) , and often two or more , that can automatically detect the occurrence of a behavioral response or action it can also register the delivery of a conditioned reinforcer , such as an led signal ( see jackson & hackenberg 1996 in the journal of the experimental analysis of behavior for example ) as a '' token '' despite such a simple configuration ( one operandum and one feeder ) it is nevertheless possible to investigate a variety of psychological phenomena modern operant conditioning chambers typically have multiple operanda , such as several response levers , two or more feeders , and a variety of devices capable of generating different stimuli including lights , sounds , music , figures , and drawings although the use of shock is not unheard of , approval may be needed in countries that regulate experimentation on animals an example of this behavior shaping is seen by way of military students slot machines and online games are sometimes cited as examples of human devices that use sophisticated operant schedules of reinforcement to reward repetitive actions
