the answer to this problem has implications for the order in which the three were composed , and the sources on which their authors drew the '' double tradition '' : sometimes matthew and luke share material which is not present in mark in summary , the two-source hypothesis proposes that matthew and luke used mark for its narrative material as well as for the basic structural outline of chronology of jesus ' life ; and that matthew and luke use a second source , q ( from german quelle , '' source '' ) , not extant , for the sayings ( logia ) found in both of them but not in mark on a more specific level , marcan priority seems to be indicated due to instances where matthew and luke apparently omit explanatory material from mark , where matthew adds his own theological emphases to mark 's stories , and in the uneven distribution of mark 's stylistic features in matthew the existence of q follows from the conclusion that , as luke and matthew are independent of mark in the double tradition , the connection between them must be explained by their joint but independent use of a missing source or sources while the 2sh remains the most popular explanation for the origins of the synoptic gospels , two questions - the existence of the so-called '' minor agreements , '' and problems with the hypothesis of q - continue at the centre of discussion over its explanatory power a few later scholars explain the minor agreements as being due to luke 's using matthew in addition to q and mark ( 3sh ) accordingly , some scholars ( like helmut koester ) who wish to keep q while acknowledging the force of the minor agreements attribute them to a proto-mark , such as the ur-markus in the markan hypothesis ( mkh ) , adapted by mark independently from its use by matthew and luke still other scholars feel that the minor agreements are due to a revision of the mark found in the bible , called deutero-mark a principal objection to the 2sh is that it requires a hypothetical document , q , the existence of which is not attested in any way , either by existing fragments ( and a great many fragments of early christian documents do exist ) or by early church tradition the minor agreements are also , according to the critics , evidence of the non-existence of , or rather the non-necessity for , q : if matthew and luke have passages which are missing in mark ( the '' who is it that struck you ? '' sentence quoted above is a famous example ) , this demonstrates only that matthew is quoting luke or vice versa when similar changes occur in double tradition material , which according to the 2sh are the result of matthew and luke relying on q , they usually show luke converging on matthew a number of scholars have suggested a three-source hypothesis , that luke actually did make some use of matthew after all some form of the two source hypothesis continues to be preferred by a majority of new testament scholars as the theory that is best able to resolve the synoptic problem farmer , also seeking to do away with the need for q , revived an updated version of griesbach 's idea that mark condensed both matthew and luke a variant of the augustinian hypothesis , attempting to synchronise matthew and mark on the basis of the mosaic '' two witnesses '' requirement of deuteronomy 19:15 ( matthew + mark â†’ luke ) , was proposed by eta linnemann , following rejection of the view of her teacher rudolf bultmann
