he also noticed that when styrol was exposed to air , light , or heat , it gradually transformed into a hard , rubber-like substance , which he called '' styrol oxide '' '' ( for the solid residue , the name '' styrol oxide '' would fit note that blyth and hofmann state the empirical formula of styrene as c 16 h 8 because at that time , some chemists used the wrong atomic mass for carbon ( 6 instead of 12 ) they had also determined that simon 's '' styrol oxide '' – which they renamed '' metastyrol '' – had the same empirical formula as styrene 348 : '' analysis as well as synthesis has equally proved that styrol and the vitreous mass ( for which we propose the name of metastyrol ) possess the same constitution per cent ) meanwhile , other chemists had been investigating another component of storax , namely , cinnamic acid however , the styrene that was obtained from cinnamic acid seemed different from the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin : the latter was optical rotation for further details about 19th century polarimeters , see : ) eventually , in 1876 , the dutch chemist van 't hoff resolved the ambiguity : the optical activity of the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin was due to a contaminant as such , the two production processes are often highly integrated ethylbenzene is produced via a friedel–crafts reaction between benzene and ethylene ; originally this used aluminum chloride as a catalyst , but in modern production this has been replaced by zeolites as the difference in boiling points between the two compounds is only 9 & nbsp ; °c at ambient pressure this necessitates the use of a series of distillation columns this process has suffered from low selectivity associated with the competing decomposition of methanol claims to have developed this process with commercially viable selectivities , at 400–425 & nbsp ; °c and atmospheric pressure , by forcing these components through a proprietary zeolitic catalyst another route to styrene involves the reaction of benzene and ethane the process attempts to overcome previous shortcomings in earlier attempts to develop production of styrene from ethane and benzene , such as inefficient recovery of aromatics , production of high levels of heavies and tars , and inefficient separation of hydrogen and ethane the autopolymerisation reaction can only be kept in check by the continuous addition of polymerisation inhibitors styrene is regarded as a '' known carcinogen '' , especially in case of eye contact , but also in case of skin contact , of ingestion and of inhalation , according to several sources however , a stats author describes a review that was done on scientific literature and concluded that '' the available epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal relationship between styrene exposure and any type of human cancer '' they concluded , '' the findings have to be interpreted with caution , due to the company based exposure assessment , but the possible association between exposures in the reinforced plastics industry , mainly styrene , and degenerative disorders of the nervous system and pancreatic cancer , deserves attention '' in 2012 , the danish epa concluded that the styrene data do not support a cancer concern for styrene the neurotoxic properties of styrene have also been studied and reported effects include effects on vision ( although unable to reproduce in a subsequent study ) and on hearing functions
