she persuaded the army to acclaim roger borsa his father 's successor and they hurried back to southern italy two months later , the assembly of the norman barons confirmed the succession , but bohemond regarded himself his father 's lawful heir the ensuing civil war prevented the normans from supporting pope urban ii , and enabled the brothers ' uncle , roger i of sicily , to increase his power bohemond captured bari in 1090 and before long , took control of most lands to the south of melfi it is possible that bohemond had religious reasons for joining the first crusade geoffrey malaterra bluntly states that bohemond took the cross with the intention of plundering and conquering greek lands another reason to suspect bohemond 's religious zeal is the supposed embassy bohemond sent to godfrey of bouillon , a powerful crusade leader , asking him to join forces to sack constantinople while godfrey declined his offer , taking constantinople was never far from bohemond 's mind , as seen in his later attempt to take over the byzantine empire others like bohemond had experience fighting the byzantines and muslim groups in the east fifteen years prior with robert guiscard it 's not clear what exact negotiations bohemond and alexios made concerning bohemond governing part of the eastern byzantine empire alexios hoped the crusaders would reclaim bohemond 's best chance at gaining a favorable position was to be loyal to alexios , which he attempted to prove while the crusaders were camped around constantinople bohemond 's reputation as an effective strategist and leader came from his fighting experience in the balkans when he took charge of his father 's army against emperor alexios ( 1082–1085 ) bohemond 's familiarity with this eastern strategy allowed him to adapt quickly leading to crusader victories through antioch bohemond saw the opportunity to use the crusade for his own ends at the siege of antioch when his nephew tancred left the main army at heraclea cybistra and attempted to establish a footing in cilicia , the movement may have been already intended as a preparation for bohemond 's eastern principality due to his successful efforts bohemond was seen as the actual leader of the siege of antioch , rather than the elected leader stephen of blois , who would soon leave the siege , claiming illness bohemond was able to make a deal with firouz , one of the commanders of the city wall to end the siege of antioch however , he did not press to end the siege until may 1098 when learning of the approach of kerbogha with a relief army to aid antioch he then proposed to the other crusade leaders that the leader to take antioch should be put in charge of the city as alexios ' representative tetigus had left in february 1098 the crusaders ' troubles were not over , however , as kerbogha started his own siege on the newly crusader held antioch bohemond then wanted to take control of antioch for himself , but there were some problems he had to face first raymond claimed that bohemond and other leaders would be breaking their oath to alexios , which was to give any conquered lands to the byzantine empire bohemond set himself up as the prince of antioch , and no latin crusader or byzantine force came to take it from him while there he took part in the installation of dagobert of pisa as patriarch of jerusalem , perhaps in order to check the growth of godfrey and his knights of lorraine 's power in the city by submitting to the patriarch bohemond made connections to jerusalem , who could be an ally against future attacks on antioch , and to keep in the good graces of the pope while bohemond had the fine territory , strategic position , and army necessary to found a principality in antioch , he had to face two great forces—the byzantine empire , which claimed the whole of his territories , and the strong muslim principalities in the north-east of syria bohemond managed to send one soldier to seek help from baldwin of edessa but was captured it was followed by a greek attack on cilicia and , despairing of his own resources , bohemond returned to europe for reinforcements in late 1104 henry i of england famously prevented him from landing on english shores , since the king anticipated bohemond 's great attraction to the english nobility he thought that defending antioch against alexios would not be enough , since he was greatly outnumbered by the byzantine army instead , bohemond decided to go on the offensive and attack the byzantine empire at its core in constantinople bohemond was then resolved to use his newly recruited army of 34,000 men not to defend antioch against the greeks , but to attack alexios treadgold , a history of the byzantine state and society , 626 bohemond took a similar route that was successful for his father in illyria and greece
