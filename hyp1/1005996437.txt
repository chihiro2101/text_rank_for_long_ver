many sites were discovered across northwestern india people in villages neighbouring to lothal had known of the presence of an ancient town and human remains speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city , lothal was not a large settlement at all , and its '' dock '' was perhaps an irrigation tank remote sensing and topographical studies published by indian scientists in the journal of the indian geophysicists union in 2004 revealed an ancient , meandering river adjacent to lothal , in length according to satellite imagery— an ancient extension of the northern river channel bed of a tributary of the bhogavo river small channel widths when compared to the lower reaches suggest the presence of a strong tidal influence upon the city—tidal waters ingressed up to and beyond the city upstream elements of this river provided a suitable source of freshwater for the inhabitants the rulers of the town lived in the acropolis , which featured paved baths , underground and surface drains ( built of kiln-fired bricks ) and potable water well the lower town was also periodically enlarged during lothal 's years of prosperity while the consensus view amongst archaeologists identifies this structure as a '' dockyard , '' it has also been suggested that owing to small dimensions , this basin may have been an irrigation tank and canal the dock was built on the eastern flank of the town , and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order it was located away from the main current of the river to avoid silting , but provided access to ships in high tide as well there was an important public building opposite to the warehouse whose superstructure has completely disappeared however , with rising prosperity , lothal 's people failed to upkeep their walls and dock facilities , possibly as a result of over-confidence in their systems municipal administration was strict – the width of most streets remained the same over a long time , and no encroached structures were built most of their equipment : metal tools , weights , measures , seals , earthenware and ornaments were of the uniform standard and quality found across the indus civilization lothal was a major trade centre , importing en masse raw materials like copper , chert and semi-precious stones from mohenjo-daro and harappa , and mass distributing to inner villages and towns a powerful flood submerged the town and destroyed most of the houses , with the walls and platforms heavily damaged the worst consequence was the shift in the course of the river , cutting off access to the ships and dock houses were rebuilt , yet without removal of flood debris , which made them poor-quality and susceptible to further damage archaeological evidence shows that the site continued to be inhabited , albeit by a much smaller population devoid of urban influences the few people who returned to lothal could not reconstruct and repair their city , but surprisingly continued to stay and preserved religious traditions , living in poorly built houses and reed huts while the trade and resources of the city were almost entirely gone , the people retained several harappan ways in writing , pottery , and utensils the people of lothal made significant and often unique contributions to human civilisation in the indus era , in the fields of city planning , art , architecture , science , engineering , pottery , and religion a thick ring-like shell object found with four slits each in two margins served as a compass to measure angles on plane surfaces such as housing alignments , roads or land surveys the extent of drains provided archaeologists with many clues regarding the layout of streets , organisation of housing and baths today , the local villagers likewise worship a sea goddess , vanuvati sikotarimata , suggesting a connection with the ancient port 's traditions and historical past as an access to the sea lothal copper is unusually pure , lacking the arsenic typically used by coppersmiths across the rest of the indus valley lothal was one of the most important centres of production for shell-working , owing to the abundance of chank shell of high quality found in the gulf of kutch and near the kathiawar coast lothal offers two new types of potter work , a convex bowl with or without stud handle , and a small jar with flaring rim , both in the micaceous red ware period , not found in contemporary indus cultures at the height of its habitation , it covered a wider area since remains have been found south of the mound but thanks to the loam deposited by persistent floods , the dock walls were preserved beyond the great deluge ( c the flood-damaged peripheral wall of mud-bricks is visible near the warehouse area the asi has covered the peripheral walls , the wharf and many houses of the early phase with earth to protect from natural phenomena , but the entire archaeological site is nevertheless facing grave concerns about necessary preservation the dockyard was located away from the main current to avoid deposition of silt it is speculated that lothal engineers studied tidal movements , and their effects on brick-built structures , since the walls are of kiln-burnt bricks another assessment is that the basin could have served as an irrigation tank , for the estimated original dimensions of the '' dock '' are not large enough , by modern standards , to house ships and conduct much traffic beck author paul yule pages 31 year 1982 the controversy was finally settled when scientists from the national institute of oceanography , goa discovered foraminifera ( marine microfossils ) and salt , gypsum crystals ( due to evapouration of seawater ) in the rectangular structure clearly indicating that sea water once filled the structure additional evidence includes findings of 7 stone anchors of which 5 were found in the dock , 5 terracotta models of boats and a circular persian gulf seal from bahrain when the river changed its course in 2000 & nbsp ; bce , a smaller inlet , wide was made in the longer arm , connected to the river by a channel provision was made for the escape of excess water through the outlet channel , wide and high in the southern arm the dock also possessed a lock-gate system—a wooden door could be lowered at the mouth of the outlet to retain a minimum column of water in the basin so as to ensure flotation at low tides central to the city 's economy , the warehouse was originally built on sixty-four cubical blocks , square , with passages , and based on a 3.5-metre-high ( 11.5 & nbsp ; ft ) mud-brick podium despite elaborate precautions , the major floods that brought the city 's decline destroyed all but twelve blocks , which became the makeshift storehouse lothal 's acropolis was the town centre , its political and commercial heart , measuring east-to-west by north-to-south the four sides of the rectangular platform on which houses were built are formed by mud-brick structures of thickness and high the remains of this house give evidence to a sophisticated drainage system built in straight rows on either side of the street are residences and workshops , although brick-built drains and early period housing has disappeared the bead factory , which performs a very important economic function , possesses a central courtyard and eleven rooms , a store , and a guardhouse a large mud-brick building faces the factory , and its significance is noted by its plan
