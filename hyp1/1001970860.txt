used lab operations funds to pay for lobbying related to the renewal of its 2 billion contract to operate the lab snl/nm consists of five technical areas ( ta ) and several additional test areas each ta has its own distinctive operations ; however , the operations of some groups at sandia may span more than one ta , with one part of a team working on a problem from one angle , and another subset of the same team located in a different building or area working with other specialized equipment ta-i operations are dedicated primarily to three activities the design , research , and development of weapon systems ; limited production of weapon system components ; and energy programs a testing facility , the explosive component facility , integrates many of the previous ta-ii test activities as well as some testing activities previously performed in other remote test areas the access delay technology test facility is also located in ta-ii ta-iv , located approximately 1/2 mile ( 1 & nbsp ; km ) south of ta-i , consists of several inertial-confinement fusion research and pulsed power research facilities , including the high energy radiation megavolt electron source ( hermes-iii ) , the z facility , the short pulsed high intensity nanosecond x-radiator ( sphinx ) facility , and the saturn accelerator in the 1970s , the sandia , los alamos , air force weapons laboratory technical exchange committee initiated the development of the slatec library of mathematical and statistical routines , written in fortran 77 today , sandia national laboratories is home to several open-source software projects : fclib ( feature characterization library ) is a library for the identification and manipulation of coherent regions or structures from spatio-temporal data fclib focuses on providing data structures that are '' feature-aware '' and support feature-based analysis soccoro , a collaborative effort with wake forest and vanderbilt universities , is object-oriented software for performing electronic-structure calculations based on density-functional theory the guided projectile is kept cheap because it does not need an inertial measurement unit , since its small size allows it to make the fast corrections necessary without the aid of an imu computer modeling shows that a standard bullet would miss a target at by , while an equivalent guided bullet would hit within
