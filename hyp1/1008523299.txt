the company placed a strong emphasis on a rapid build and test cycle the company took two similar vehicles , pixel and texel , to the event the vehicles narrowly failed to win the level 1 prize , after making three dramatic attempts totalling over 5 minutes in the air , armadillo aerospace - news archive finally crashing out on the final attempt during testing one of the two quad vehicles ( named texel ) crashed on a tethered flight after a guidance problem caused the vehicle to rapidly gain altitude until 3 separate flight termination procedures were activated at approximately 20â€“30 feet the plan was to have the first module ( of the next generation modular design ) compete at level 1 , and have pixel compete at level 2 challenge in the level 1 events , armadillo 's craft mod ( actually , module 1 ) logged several attempts , including several successful first leg flights , but was unable to complete the return trip during any attempt on the second attempt , the first leg flight was perfect ; increased guidance and control capabilities allowed the module to , in carmack 's words , 'burn the x-mark off the target pad ' armadillo had an unsuccessful first attempt at level 1 , and landed early due to inadequate thrust armadillo 's attempt at the level 2 prize on october 25 was aborted due to their vehicle toppling over after the engine casing burned through due to a fuel-line problem in 2008 , the rocket racing league announced that armadillo aerospace engines would be used in a second generation of x-racer aircraft in late 2010 , armadillo started development of a new , longer rocket design created for lower-drag , higher-speed high-altitude flights , which they named stig in homage of the top gear driver the stig the third flight took place in january 2013 and the vehicle experienced a hard landing following a parachute failure-to-deploy , though the launch was good he estimated that another 2 million would be needed to achieve a crewed flight to 100 & nbsp ; km using armadillo 's modular design in a '' six-pack '' configuration in august 2013 , carmack indicated that following the crash of the stig-b rocket earlier that year , he had wound down the company operations and had put the company in '' hibernation mode '' armadillo had stopped accepting ( profitable ) contract r & d work two years prior , in order to focus on development of a suborbital reusable rocket several reasons were offered for this outcome , including a failure to adopt a multi-test-vehicle build strategy , making the loss of a single rocket more significant than it would have otherwise been carmack stated in his monthly reports and in forum posts that he expected his path to an orbital vehicle to include modular rockets similar to otrag technology i seriously considered an otrag style massive-cluster-of-cheap-modules orbital design back when we had 98 % peroxide ( assumed to be a biprop with kerosene ) , and i have always considered it one of the viable routes to significant reduction in orbital launch costs eventually , reusable stages will take over , but i actually think that we can make it all the way to orbit on our current budget by following this path
