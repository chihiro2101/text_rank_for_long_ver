virtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the bayer process which involves dissolving bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to the residue or bauxite tailings , which is mostly iron oxide , is highly caustic due to residual sodium hydroxide while the mud was considered non-toxic due to low levels of heavy metals , the associated slurry had a ph of 13 aluminium hydroxide also finds use as a fire retardant filler for polymer applications magnesium hydroxide and mixtures of huntite and hydromagnesite are used similarly it decomposes at about , absorbing a considerable amount of heat in the process and giving off water vapour freshly precipitated aluminium hydroxide forms gels , which are the basis for the application of aluminium salts as flocculants in water purification this compound is also used to control hyperphosphatemia ( elevated phosphate , or phosphorus , levels in the blood ) in people and animals suffering from kidney failure since it absorbs protein well , it also functions to stabilize vaccines by preventing the proteins in the vaccine from precipitating or sticking to the walls of the container during storage aluminium hydroxide is sometimes called '' alum '' , a term generally reserved for one of several sulfates vaccine formulations containing aluminium hydroxide stimulate the immune system by inducing the release of uric acid , an immunological danger signal
