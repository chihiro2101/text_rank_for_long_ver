print on demand with digital technology is a way to print items for a fixed cost per copy , regardless of the size of the order digital technology is ideally suited to publish small print jobs of posters ( often as a single copy ) when they are needed for example , uk art retailer king and mcgaw fulfills many of its art print orders by printing on-demand rather than pre-printing and storing them until they are sold , requiring less space and reducing overheads to the business pod creates a new category of publishing ( or printing ) company that offers services , usually for a fee , directly to authors who wish to self-publish other services may also be available , including formatting , proofreading , and editing , but such companies typically do not spend money for marketing , unlike conventional publishers pod publishing gives authors editorial independence , speed to market , ability to revise content , and greater financial return per copy than royalties paid by conventional publishers instead of tailoring themselves to the classic book format ( at least 100 pages , mostly text , complex rules for copyright and royalties ) , these companies strive to make pod more mass-market by creating programs by which a range of different text and picture items can be produced as finished books among traditional publishers , pod services can be used to make sure that books remain available when one print job has sold out , but another has not yet become available this maintains the availability of older works , the estimated future sales of which may not be great enough to justify a further conventional print job this can be useful for publishers with large backlists , such that sales for individual works may be few , but cumulative sales may be significant print on demand can be used to reduce risk when dealing with '' surge '' publications that are expected to have large sales but a brief sales life ( such as biographies of minor celebrities , or event tie-ins ) : these publications represent good profitability but also great risk owing to the danger of inadvertently printing many more copies than are necessary , and the associated costs of maintaining excess inventory or pulping print on demand is also used to print and reprint '' niche '' books that may have a high retail price but limited sales opportunities , such as specialist academic works an academic publisher may be expected to keep these specialist works in print even though the target market is almost saturated , making further conventional print jobs uneconomic because the per-unit cost is typically greater with pod than with a print job of thousands of copies , it is common for pod books to be more expensive than similar books made by conventional print jobs , especially if a book is produced exclusively with pod instead of using pod as a supplemental technology between print jobs pod books are rarely if ever available on such terms because for the publishing provider it is considered too much of a risk however , wholesalers monitor what works they are selling , and if authors promote their work successfully and achieve a reasonable number of orders from book stores or online retailers ( who use the same wholesalers as the stores ) , then there is a reasonable chance of their work becoming available on such terms
