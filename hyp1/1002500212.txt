alternatives to holding a by-election include : choosing from those losing candidates at the previous election who choose to contest the recount to fill the vacancy , as in tasmania or the australian capital territory , keeping the seat vacant until the next general election for the australian senate ( in which each state forms a multi-member constituency elected via single transferable vote ) , the state parliament appoints a replacement in the event of a vacancy ; in 1977 a referendum amended the constitution to require that the person appointed must belong to the same political party ( if any ) as the senator originally elected to that seat scotland and new zealand still hold by-elections , despite having adopted the mixed-member proportional representation system , in which some members are chosen by party lists if a vacancy arises from the death or resignation of a party list member , the next unelected candidate on the party list is offered the seat if that candidate has died or declines the seat , it is offered to subsequent candidates on the list until one accepts the seat for example , on the resignation of darren hughes in march 2011 , louisa wall was elected after all the five candidates above her on the new zealand labour party 's list declined the seat this was changed in january 1953 , since which time vacancies in constituency seats have been filled by the next candidate on the state list of the party which won the seat , in the same manner as vacancies among list seats since no independents have been elected to the bundestag since the first legislative period , no such substitute election has ever taken place for example , andrea horwath 's win in an ontario provincial by-election in 2004 allowed the ontario new democratic party to regain official party status with important results in terms of parliamentary privileges and funding '' seats which have unexpectedly changed hands in by-elections often revert to the former party in the next general election similarly , the upset 1960 by-election victory of walter pitman in peterborough as a '' new party '' candidate was a significant boost for the movement to replace the co-operative commonwealth federation with an unnamed '' new party '' which would be integrated with the labour movement gilles duceppe 's 1990 upset landslide by-election victory in laurier—sainte-marie with 66 % of the vote on behalf of the newly formed bloc québécois was the first electoral test for what was initially a loose parliamentary formation created two months earlier after several quebec mps defected from the progressive conservative and liberal parties to protest the failure of the meech lake accord and provided the first indication that the party could be a serious force in the province of quebec on the strength of the by-election victory , the bq went on to be officially formed as a party in 1991 and to win 54 seats in the 1993 federal election , enough to form the official opposition the media called it a '' mini-election '' , a test of the liberal government 's popularity with a general election due in less than a year the effect of the manoeuvre was blunted when the conservative party refused to stand candidates against them , and the following year the glc was abolished as australia used a first-past-the-post system at the time , the conservative vote was split between the country and nationalists , allowing labor candidate edwin corboy to come in first place and win the seat wentworth was considered an exceptionally safe seat for the liberal party , as it had only ever been held by the liberal party and its predecessor parties since its creation in 1901 his surprise defeat at the hand of joseph noseworthy of the co-operative commonwealth federation ended his political career , and may also have been a factor in the conservative party 's decision to move to the left and rebrand itself the progressive conservative party under meighen 's replacement his appointment as a senior minister while not a member of either house of parliament was against convention , and he therefore sought to regularise the position by standing in the first available by-election , which was at leyton in january 1965
