in a separate discovery , a well preserved cave bear cub was also found in a fourth of the skulls found in the conturines , the third premolar is still present , while more derived specimens elsewhere lack it this study confirmed and built on results from a previous study using mitochondrial dna extracted from cave bear remains ranging from 20,000 to 130,000 years old cave bear teeth were very large and show greater wear than most modern bear species , suggesting a diet of tough materials however , tubers and other gritty food , which cause distinctive tooth wear in modern brown bears , do not appear to have constituted a major part of cave bears ' diets on the basis of dental microwear analysis however , some evidence points toward the occasional inclusion of animal protein in cave bear diets for example , toothmarks on cave bear remains in areas where cave bears are the only recorded potential carnivores suggests occasional cannibalistic scavenging , possibly on individuals that died during hibernation , and dental microwear analysis indicates the cave bear may have fed on a greater quantity of bone than its contemporary , the smaller eurasian brown bear additionally , cave bear remains from pe»ôtera cu oase in the southwestern tip of the romanian part of the carpathian mountains had elevated levels of nitrogen-15 in their bones , indicative of omnivore diets , although the values are within the range of those found for the strictly herbivorous mammoth although the current prevailing opinion concludes that cave bears were largely herbivorous , and more so than any modern species of the genus ursus , increasing evidence points to omnivorous diets , based both on regional variability of isotopic composition of bone remains indicative of dietary plasticity , and on a recent re-evaluation of craniodental morphology that places the cave bear squarely among omnivorous modern bear species with respect to its skull and tooth shapes male cave bear skeletons have been found with broken bacula , probably due to fighting during the breeding season the huge number of bones found in southern , central and eastern europe has led some scientists to think europe may have once had herds of cave bears however , there have been archeological finds of cave bear teeth used in a necklace that dates back only 12,000 years ago , suggesting that the extinction may have happened much later compared with other megafaunal species that also became extinct during the last glacial maximum , the cave bear was believed to have had a more specialized diet of high-quality plants and a relatively restricted geographical range additionally , mitochondrial dna research indicated that the genetic decline of the cave bear began long before it became extinct , demonstrating habitat loss due to climate change was not responsible finally , high nitrogen-15 levels were found in cave bear bones from romania , indicating wider dietary possibilities than previously believed overhunting by humans has been largely dismissed because human populations at the time were too small to pose a serious threat to the cave bear 's survival , though the two species may have competed for living space in caves unlike brown bears , cave bears are seldom represented in cave paintings , leading some experts to believe the cave bear may have been avoided by human hunters the walking larder : patterns of domestication , pastoralism , and predation by juliet clutton-brock , published by routledge , 1990 , or their habitat preferences may not have overlapped some evidence indicates that the cave bear used only caves for hibernation and was not inclined to use other locations , such as thickets , for this purpose , in contrast to the more versatile brown bear this specialized hibernation behavior would have caused a high winter mortality rate for cave bears that failed to find available caves therefore , as human populations slowly increased , the cave bear faced a shrinking pool of suitable caves , and slowly faded away to extinction , as both neanderthals and anatomically modern humans sought out caves as living quarters , depriving the cave bear of vital habitat in 2019 the results of a large scale study of 81 bone specimens ( resulting in 59 new sequences ) , and 64 previously published complete mitochondrial genomes of cave bear mitochondrial dna remains found in switzerland , poland , france , spain , germany , italy and serbia , indicated that the cave bear population drastically declined starting around 40,000 years ago at the onset of the aurignacian , coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans in a study of spanish cave bear mtdna , each cave used by cave bears was found to contain almost exclusively a unique lineage of closely related haplotypes , indicating a homing behaviour for birthing and hibernation
