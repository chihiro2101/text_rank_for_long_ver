many languages make a distinction between singular and plural : english , for example , distinguishes between man and men , or house and houses in some languages , in addition to such singular and plural forms , there is also a dual form , which is used when exactly two people or things are meant in many languages with dual forms , the use of the dual is mandatory as in some arabic dialects using dual in nouns as in hejazi arabic , and the plural is used only for groups greater than two in other languages such as hebrew , the dual exists only for words naming time spans ( day , week , etc ( first-person dual forms , however , do not exist ; compare this to the lack of third-person dual forms in the old germanic languages ) many of the spoken arabic dialects have a dual marking for nouns ( only ) , and its use can be mandatory in some dialects , and not mandatory in others the dual in hebrew has also atrophied , generally being used for only time , number , and natural pairs ( like body parts ) even in its biblical hebrew this form once existed in tagalog or sometimes but has disappeared from standard usage ( save for certain dialects such as in batangas ) since the middle of the 20th century , with kit√° as the only surviving form ( e.g the dual was a common feature of all early slavic languages around the year 1000 in modern standard arabic , as well as in classical arabic , the use of dual is compulsory when describing two units besides the noun and adjective dual , there are also dual verb forms of compulsory use for second and third person , together with their pronouns , but none for the first person the use of dual in spoken arabic varies widely and is mostly rendered a even when in nominative context whereas its use is quite common in levantine arabic , for instance meaning '' two kilograms '' , dual forms are generally not used in maghrebi arabic , where two units are commonly expressed with the word , as in meaning '' a pair of kilograms '' , with the noun appearing in singular the dual form is usually used in expressions of time and number
