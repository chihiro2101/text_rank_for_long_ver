initially the laser medium is pumped while the q-switch is set to prevent feedback of light into the gain medium ( producing an optical resonator with low q ) due to losses from spontaneous emission and other processes , after a certain time the stored energy will reach some maximum level ; the medium is said to be gain saturated at this point , the q-switch device is quickly changed from low to high q , allowing feedback and the process of optical amplifier by stimulated emission to begin because of the large amount of energy already stored in the gain medium , the intensity of light in the laser resonator builds up very quickly ; this also causes the energy stored in the medium to be depleted almost as quickly the net result is a short pulse of light output from the laser , known as a giant pulse , which may have a very high peak intensity an additional advantage of modulators is that the rejected light may be coupled out of the cavity and can be used for something else ideally , this brings the absorber into a state with low losses to allow efficient extraction of the stored energy by the laser pulse direct control of the repetition rate can be achieved by using a pulsed pump source as well as passive q-switching jitter can be reduced by not reducing the q by as much , so that a small amount of light can still circulate in the cavity the cavity q goes from low to high to start the laser buildup , and then goes from high to low to '' dump '' the beam from the cavity all at once electro-optic modulators are normally used for this , since they can easily be made to function as a near-perfect beam '' switch '' to couple the beam out of the cavity pulses of light from another laser ( the '' master oscillator '' ) are injected into the cavity by lowering the q to allow the pulse to enter and then increasing the q to confine the pulse to the cavity where it can be amplified by repeated passes through the gain medium however , q-switched lasers can also be used for measurement purposes , such as for distance measurements ( range finding ) by measuring the time it takes for the pulse to get to some target and the reflected light to get back to the sender
