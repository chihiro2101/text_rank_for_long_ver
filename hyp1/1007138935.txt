by the 19th century , jewish sabbateans had been reduced to small groups of hidden followers who feared being discovered for their beliefs , that were deemed to be entirely heretical and antithetical to rabbinic judaism these very jews fell under the category of '' sectarian '' sabbateans , which originated when many sabbateans refused to accept that zevi 's feigned apostasy might have been indicative of the fact that their faith was genuinely an illusion another large group of sabbateans succeeding zevi 's feigned apostasy began to view islam in an extremely negative light jewish historians have stated that it is hard to describe the national sense of shock and trauma that set in when the masses of jews all over the world learned that someone as famous as sabbatai zevi had officially abandoned his faith for islam however , the fact remains that zevi is the most famous jew to have become a muslim , which is also what the term sabbatean has come to denote nathan of gaza , the scholar closest to zevi , who had caused zevi to reveal his messiahship and in turn became his prophet , never followed his master into islam but remained a jew , albeit excommunicated by his jewish brethren claims of ties between sabbatean kabbalah and sufism go back to the days of sabbatai zevi.2 this is largely based on the contention that zevi 's exile in the balkans brought him into close contact with several forms of unorthodox sufism which existed in the region the dönme community of salonika came to play a significant role in the sufi life of the region and its members actively involved with a number of sufi orders , particularly the mevlevi inside the ottoman empire , those followers of zevi who had converted to islam but who secretly continued jewish observances and brit mila became known as the dönme '' convert '' ) the emden-eybeschutz controversy was a serious rabbinical disputation with wider political ramifications in europe that followed the accusations by rabbi jacob emden ( 1697–1776 ) who was a fierce opponent of the sabbateans , against rabbi jonathan eybeschutz ( 1690–1764 ) whom he accused of being a secret sabbatean the majority of the rabbis in poland , moravia , and bohemia , as well as the leaders of the three communities , supported eybeschutz : the accusation was '' utterly incredible '' - in july 1725 , the ashkenazic beit din of amsterdam had issued a ban of excommunication on the entire sabbatian sect ( kat ha-ma ’ aminim ) emden later suggested that the rabbis decided against attacking eybeschutz out of a reluctance to offend his powerful family and a fear of rich supporters of his living in their communities emden , sefer hitabbkut , fos the controversy was a momentous incident in jewish history of the period , involving both yechezkel landau and the vilna gaon , and may be credited with having crushed the lingering belief in sabbatai current even in some orthodox circles at the same time his younger son , wolf , presented himself as a sabbatean prophet , with the result that the yeshiva was closed critics of hasidic judaism expressed concern that hasidism might become a messianic sect as had occurred among the followers of both sabbatai zevi and jacob frank however the baal shem tov , the founder of hasidism , came at a time when the jewish masses of eastern europe were reeling in bewilderment and disappointment engendered by the two jewish false messiahs sabbatai zevi ( 1626–1676 ) and jacob frank ( 1726–1791 ) in particular some scholars have noted that the sabbatean movement in general fostered and connected well with the principles of modern secularism related to this is the drive of the donmeh in turkey for secularizing their society just as european jews promoted the values of age of enlightenment and its jewish equivalent the haskalah he waged war untiringly on the sabbateans , which he regarded as dangerous to the best interests of judaism , and in this connection wrote his esh dat ( london , 1715 ) against nehemiah hayyun ( who supported zevi ) the dönmes : crypto-jews under turkish rule the donmeh : true believers , jewish heretics or untrustworthy moslem converts ? globalization , cosmopolitanism , and the dönme in ottoman salonica and turkish istanbul a messianic epiphany : the conversion of the dönme sabbateans '' the history of naming the ottoman/turkish sabbatians '' , by cengiz sisman , in studies on istanbul and beyond ed
