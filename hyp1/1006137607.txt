brown driver briggs brown-driver-briggs hebrew and english lexicon ; hendrickson publishers 1996 among the jews of the second temple period , the biblical aramaic/hebrew name yeshua ‘ was common : the hebrew bible mentions several individuals with this name – while also using their full name joshua '' the new strong 's exhaustive concordance of the bible ( nashville : thomas nelson publishers 1990 ) the name '' yeshua '' ( transliterated in the english old testament as jeshua ) is a late form of the biblical hebrew name yehoshua ( joshua ) , and spelled with a waw in the second syllable the name yehoshua has the form of a compound of '' yeho- '' and '' shua '' : yeho- is another form of yahu , a theophoric element standing for the name of god יהוה ( the tetragrammaton yhwh , sometimes transcribed into english as yahweh ) , and shua ‘ is a noun meaning '' a cry for help '' , '' a saving cry '' , '' '' , ernest klein , a comprehensive etymological dictionary of the hebrew language ( new york : macmillan publishing company 1987 ) , where it means '' a cry for help '' according to the book of numbers verse 13:16 , the name of joshua , the son of nun was originally hoshea ` , and the name '' yehoshua ` '' is usually spelled the same but with a yod added at the beginning ) in the 1st century , philo of alexandria , in a greek exposition , offered this understanding of moses ’ s reason for the name change of the biblical hero jehoshua/joshua son of nun from hoshea similar to hoshia ` meaning '' he rescued '' to yehoshua in commemoration of his salvation : '' and ιησους refers to salvation of the lord '' ιησους or iesous being the greek form of the name ( on the change of names 21.121 ) similarly , the septuagint renders ben sira as saying ( in the greek form of the name ) : '' ιησους the son of naue yehoshua ben nun who according to his name became great unto the salvation/deliverance of his chosen ones '' ( ben sira 46:1–2 ) however , ben sira originally wrote in hebrew in the 2nd century bc , and the only extant hebrew manuscript for this passage has '' in his days '' , not '' according to his name '' ( which would be in hebrew ) , and thus does not comment on the name yehoshua as connoting '' deliverance '' : '' yehoshua ben nun , who was formed to be in his days a great deliverer for his chosen ones '' thus it is pronounced in modern hebrew the hebrew name of jesus of nazareth is probably pronounced 'yeshua ' , although this is uncertain and depends on the reconstruction of several ancient hebrew dialects greek or iēsoûs is also used to represent the name of joshua son of nun in the new testament passages acts 7:45 and hebrews 4:8 ( it was even used in the septuagint to translate the name hoshea in one of the three verses where this referred to joshua the son of nun—deut ( some concern remains over whether these fragments faithfully represent the original hebrew text or are instead a later translation back into hebrew in the documentary the lost tomb of jesus , archeologist amos kloner stated that the name yeshua was then a popular form of the name yehoshua and was '' one of the common names in the time of the second temple thus , both the full form yehoshua and the abbreviated form yeshua were in use during the gospel period – and in relation to the same person , as in the hebrew bible references to yehoshua/yeshua son of nun , and yehoshua/yeshua the high priest in the days of ezra ( note : scholars typically argue the word '' hebrew '' in the new testament refers to aramaic ; however , others have attempted to refute this view ) the aramaic of the peshitta does not distinguish between joshua and jesus , and the lexicon of william jennings gives the same form for both names in the talmud , only one reference is made to the spelling yeshua , in verbatim quotation from the hebrew bible regarding jeshua son of jozadak ( elsewhere called joshua son of josedech ) in references to jesus in the talmud , however , where the name occurs , it is rendered yeshu , which is a name reserved in aramaic and hebrew literature from the early medieval period until today , solely for jesus of nazareth , not for other joshuas in general rabbinical sources use yeshu , and this is the form to which some named references to jesus in the talmud as yeshu occur in some manuscripts of the babylonian talmud , though some scholars , such as maier ( 1978 ) have argued that the presence of the name yeshu in these texts is a late interpolation there are no undisputed examples of any aramaic or hebrew text where yeshu refers to anyone else than jesus van voorst – 2000 '' this is likely an inference from the talmud and other jewish usage , where jesus is called yeshu , and other jews with the same name are called by the fuller name yehoshua , '' joshua '' ( e.g cohen a friend of all faiths – page 42 – 2004 '' in hebrew school , one of my teachers had explained that yeshu ( hebrew for jesus ) , rather than meaning '' saviour , '' in fact was an acronym that stood for yimach shemo ve-zichrono : '' may his name and memory be erased '' proceedings : volume 4 aḳademyah ha-leʼumit ha-yiśreʼelit le-madaʻim – 1969 '' perhaps the most significant of these is the passage where instead of the printed 'that certain man ' we find 'jesus the nazarene — may his name be obliterated ' ( thus also in a genizah ms , british museum , or
