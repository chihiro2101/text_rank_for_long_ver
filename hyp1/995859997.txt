suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes when plasma levels of butyrylcholinesterase are greatly diminished or an atypical form is present ( an otherwise harmless inherited disorder ) , paralysis may last much longer , as is the case in liver failure or in neonates in people with neuromuscular disease or burns , an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles , potentially resulting in cardiac arrest suxamethonium does not produce unconsciousness or anesthesia , and its effects may cause considerable psychological distress while simultaneously making it impossible for a patient to communicate the side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine receptor is propped open , allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the extracellular fluid therefore , the increase in serum potassium level is usually not catastrophic in otherwise healthy patients severely high blood levels of potassium will cause changes in cardiac electrophysiology , which , if severe , can result in asystole when mh develops during a procedure , treatment with dantrolene sodium is usually initiated ; dantrolene and the avoidance of suxamethonium administration in susceptible people have markedly reduced the mortality from this condition the normal short duration of action of suxamethonium is due to the rapid metabolism of the drug by non-specific plasma cholinesterases however plasma cholinesterase activity is reduced in some people due to either genetic variation or acquired conditions , which results in a prolonged duration of neuromuscular block acquired factors that affect plasma cholinesterase activity include pregnancy , liver disease , kidney failure , heart failure , thyrotoxicosis , and cancer , as well as a number of other drugs mivacurium , a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug , is also metabolized via the same route with a similar clinical effect in patients deficient in plasma cholinesterase activity while this phase is not abnormal and is a part of its mechanism of action , it is undesirable during surgery , due to the inability to depolarize the cell again often , patients must be on a ventilator for hours if phase 2 block occurs
