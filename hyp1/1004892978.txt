unlike the other greek letters , this letter did not take its name from the phoenician letter from which it was derived ; it was given a new name on the pattern of beta , eta and theta swedish and many romanic languages ( such as italian and spanish ) do not distinguish between the greek and roman forms of the letter ; '' zeta '' is used to refer to the roman letter z as well as the greek letter the modern pronunciation was , in all likelihood , established in the hellenistic age and may have already been a common practice in classical attic ; for example , it could count as one or two consonants metrically in attic drama contra : the tradition would not have invented this special digraph for these poets if was the normal pronunciation in all greek 993a ) ( though aristotle might as well be referring to a pronunciation ) it is even possible that the letter sometimes and for some speakers varied in pronunciation depending upon word position , i.e , like the letter x in english , which is ( usually ) pronounced z initially but gz or ks elsewhere ( cf the greek inscriptions almost never write ζ in words like or , so there must have been a difference between this sound and the sound of contra : a few inscriptions do seem to suggest that ζ was pronounced like σδ ; furthermore , all words with written σδ are morphologically transparent , and written σδ may simply be echoing the morphology contra : the use of a special symbol for is no more or no less improbable than the use of ψ for and ξ for , or , for that matter , the later invention ϛ ( stigma ) for , which happens to be the voiceless counterpart of furthermore , it is not clear that ζ was pronounced when it was originally invented mycenean greek had a special symbol to denote some sort of affricate or palatal consonant ; ζ may have been invented for this sound , which later developed into ( for a parallel development , note that original palatal proto-slavic developed into in old church slavonic , with similar developments having led to combinations such as зд and жд being quite common in russian contra : a ) this may be a later development from or under the influence of italian ; b ) even if it is derived from an ancient , it may be a dialectal pronunciation italian , similarly , has consistently used z for and ( lat contra : whether the pronunciation of was , or , di would probably still have been the closest native latin sound ; furthermore , the inscriptions are centuries later than the time for which is assumed zeta has the numerical value 7 rather than 6 because the letter digamma ( also called 'stigma ' as a greek numeral ) was originally in the sixth position in the alphabet
