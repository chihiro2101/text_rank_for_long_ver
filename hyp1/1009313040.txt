dvorak , '' why wikipedia just gets better '' pc magazine ( february 1 , 2008 ) : : you do n't think i 'm here as a wikipedia booster without some deeper commentary , do you ? there has to be something wrong with it , since the idea is utopian , and utopian ideas are bound to fail in the long term : you ca n't do a web search on any major topic without this wiki popping up near the top of the results page : so is it to be trusted ? does it have the credibility of britannica ? well , i have monitored over a decent period a number of entries on matters about which i know something and have found them almost invariably accurate it should have been a recipe for disaster , but instead wikipedia became one of the internet 's most inspiring success stories while many of the site 's 130,000-plus articles are definitely works in progress , many are rich , concise , and polished what makes the wikipedia so compelling & mdash ; and this article so hard to finish & mdash ; is the way everything is so massively linked and a quick run through some of the articles shows that this community based approach can indeed work the wikipedia , and hopefully other services similar to it , offers the possibility of everything being written into history , with all of mankind sharing knowledge and information in a way that enables everyone to profit from it bad content will be edited out , and good content will rise to the top , like cream : as further edits accumulate , the quality of the article moves asymptomatically towards perfection , and likewise the quality of the encyclopedia as a whole with a total of 16,000 articles in the database , the wikipedia is already large enough to be a source of generally reliable information , though stronger in some areas ( '' star trek '' spinoffs ) than others ( the charles_dickens works ) - manoj ( india ) two16 , from user talk : ed poor ( spelling corrected ) : : '' i 've never posted to a usenet group because nothing i wanted to say was worth the overhead of learning the interface i must tell you that yours is one of the most non-biased , fact-based articles i 've every seen on the topic thank heavens you 're all out there ! user : aarchiba on user talk : aarchiba : : i must say , wikipedia has made tremendous progress since i last fiddled with it ; it 's astonishingly compendious , and the quality is just amazing musichastherighttochildren on wikipedia : village pump : i am a newcomer to wikipedia ; although i have been aware of it and used it on occasion for quite a while , i have only recently realised the depth of this resource , and discovered the mechanics behind it : this project is fantastic ! the number of articles and the amount of information in them is truly amazing , even articles on topics so obscure i thought there would be no chance they would exist the band biographies , for example , seem to have more detailed information and useful links than any official band website i have seen : also , the articles are articulately written and unbiased , and the links between articles are very well done ( though perhaps i have whiled away too many hours in school reading article after article as a consequence of this ) wikipedia has become the primary internet resource for me ( with the possible exception of news websites ) , and i really think that it is a credit to everyone who works on it , and indeed to human nature itself ! this may seem like a sweeping statement , but it is hard to believe that something so incredible could be produced entirely voluntarily by people in their spare time wikipedia has the greatest minds on the internet , and i look forward to working with them i have n't even written my first article yet , but when i do , expect me to look to younger users for advice you need to know about something relating to it , just click on one of the links in its explanation
