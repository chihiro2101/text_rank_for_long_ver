he first saw active service as a junior artillery officer during the siege of paris in the franco-prussian war joffre subsequently spent much of his career in the colonies as a military engineer , serving with distinction in the keelung campaign during the sino-french war ( august 1884 – april 1885 ) 136–37 after returning to france in 1903 to command the 19th cavalry brigade , he then moved to the war ministry in paris as director of engineers in 1904 the minister of war adolphe messimy reorganized the high command of the french army in july 1911 with the revival of the army and a purge of '' defensive-minded '' officers , first world war – willmott , h.p he was selected to command despite never having commanded an army , even on paper , and '' having no knowledge whatever of general staff work after a left-wing government came to power in 1914 , he was due to be replaced by maurice sarrail in the autumn , but war broke out before this could take place on 15 august , after german cavalry had been spotted at dinant on the meuse , and after repeated warnings from charles lanrezac of the fifth army , joffre issued his instruction particuliere no 10 , stating that the main german effort would come through belgium 43 although joffre was aware ( 8am on 18 august ) that as many as fifteen german corps were moving through belgium ( in fact it was sixteen , and twenty-eight if the german fourth and fifth armies are also included ) , he believed that only a few of these would come west of the meuse , where he believed they could be held by the british and belgians the french third and fourth armies were preparing to attack into the ardennes , and he wanted lanrezac 's fifth army to attack the bulk of the german right wing on its west flank as – it was assumed – it attacked the left flank of french fourth army 54–55 the french first and second armies battle of lorraine on 19 and 20 august and were beaten back with severe loss by german forces , which were preparing for a counteroffensive the germans entered brussels that day , but joffre was convinced , after the defeat in alsace-lorraine and air and cavalry reports of strong german forces in belgium , that the german centre in the ardennes must be weak 64–65 the fifth army was also now attacked on its right by max von hausen 's german third army ; although these attacks were held , lanrezac asked joffre for permission to retreat 97 on 23 august joffre reported to adolphe messimy , the french war minister , that his fourth army was pressing into the ardennes with ( he believed , wrongly ) local numerical superiority , despite the fact that he had already received reports of french defeats in this sector on previous days in his memoirs joffre later admitted that he had been mistaken ( he was also unaware of the fall of namur and of the extent of the fighting at mons and charleroi on his left ) , but at the time he demanded that the french fourth army resume the offensive and provide lists of unsatisfactory officers for dismissal on 25 august , rejecting the advice of his staff officer general berthelot that lanrezac be ordered to attack westwards against the inside of the german right wing , he instead had major maurice gamelin draw up plans for a french concentration at amiens , with many of the troops drawn from the french right wing in alsace , and with regret also ordered the successful counterattacks of the third army and the army of lorraine be called off 116–18 michel-joseph maunoury was put in command of the newly formed sixth army , which initially assembled near amiens and then fell back toward paris ( 26 august ) 141 concerned at reports ( which later turned out to be exaggerated ) that the british had been defeated at le cateau and would need french protection to recover cohesion , early on 27 august joffre gave lanrezac a direct written order to counterattack as soon as his forces were on open ground , where they could use their artillery , which lanrezac had told him was the key factor after lanrezac spent the day arguing against the order , joffre visited him at 8.30 & nbsp ; am on 28 august and ordered him to attack to the west 146–49 , 152 fernand de langle de cary 's fourth army , originally intended to be the spearhead of the attack into the ardennes , was a strong force and had made several counterattacks , but joffre now ordered it to cease counterattacking and to send a detachment under ferdinand foch to cover the gap between fourth and fifth armies ; this became the new ninth army messimy , the war minister , ordered joffre to provide three active corps to defend paris on 25 august , but joffre , regarding this as interference with strategy , ignored him on 26 august rené viviani formed a new government ( the union sacrée ) , and on 27 august the new war minister , alexandre millerand , who had replaced messimy largely because of the poor state of the paris defences , visited joffre the general promised to provide the three corps for paris if maunoury 's attack near amiens failed 399 on 30 august joffre recommended that the french government evacuate paris and learned of the russian disaster at tannenberg , although he was aware that two german corps were still headed east as reinforcements for east prussia 166 on 1 september the fifth army retreated across the aisne in some confusion , and joffre issued his instruction generale no 4 , placing maunoury 's sixth army under the command of joseph gallieni as military governor of paris and forming a new cavalry corps under louis conneau to fill the gap between the fifth army and the british expeditionary force ( bef ) 181–83 on the night of 3–4 september joffre sent a handwritten note to gallieni , wanting maunoury to push east along the north bank of the marne , although not specifying a date 87 at 9.45 & nbsp ; am on 4 september gallieni , who had learned from paris aviators the previous day that kluck 's german first army was marching south-east across paris , had the first of a series of telephone calls , conducted through aides , as joffre would not come to the phone , and gallieni refused to speak to anyone else gallieni proposed , depending on how much further the germans were to be allowed to advance , to attack north of the marne on 6 september or south of the marne on 7 september 227 joffre 's reply saying he preferred the southern option ( which would take a day longer as it forced the sixth army to cross to south of the marne , but would keep the sixth army and bef from being separated by the river ) arrived too late to reach gallieni , who had left for a meeting with the bef chief of staff , archibald murray that same afternoon , henry wilson , the bef sub-chief of staff , was negotiating separate plans with franchet d'espèrey , on the british right , which envisaged the sixth army attacking north of the marne while joffre was having dinner with the british liaison officer , sidney clive , and two visiting japanese officers , neither of whom appeared to understand a word of french , a message arrived from franchet d'espèrey saying that he would be ready to attack on 6 september joffre agreed to bring forward the allied offensive to 6 september and to have the sixth army attack north of the marne instead , later writing that he had done so reluctantly as maunoury would probably make contact with the germans on 5 september , but that an extra day would have left the germans in a more '' disadvantageous '' position 190–91 on 7 september gallieni , who had been going over joffre 's head and speaking to the war minister and president raymond poincaré , was ordered not to communicate directly with the government he told wilson ( 23 march ) that '' by the end of april he would be in a condition to attack & break ( underline ) the line with viviani 's government in trouble following the resignation of theophile delcasse as foreign minister , the second battle of champagne and the bulgaria during world war i , viviani asked joffre , who had told him that nine out of ten generals would make poor ministers of war , whether gallieni would be a good replacement for millerand 226–29 as far back at 29 july 1915 joffre had demanded that he be appointed commander-in-chief over all french forces , including those at the dardanelles by november he was again lobbying poincaré that either a strong minister of war , backed by a strong chief of staff ( e.g 264 gallieni wrote to joffre ( 16 or 18 december 1915 ) , expressing concern at the state of trenches at verdun and elsewhere on the front ; in fact , matters were already being taken in hand at verdun 55 after months of discussion , haig and joffre agreed on 14 february 1916 to an anglo-french battle of the somme , although the british were not pleased at joffre 's suggestion that the british engage in '' wearing out '' attacks prior to the main offensive 40–42 the french general staff had decided in august 1915 to partially disarm all the verdun forts , under the erroneous assumption that they could not resist the effects of modern heavy artillery , and the germans initially made good progress against fortifications that had had their guns removed in the words of one french divisional commander , its loss would cost the french army a hundred thousand lives 231 , 243–34 general haig wanted to delay the battle of the somme until 15 august to allow for more training and more artillery eventually , perhaps influenced by reports of french troop disturbances at verdun , haig agreed to attack at the start of july this was just in time , as it later turned out that philippe pétain , commander at verdun , was warning the french government that the '' game was up '' unless the british attacked joffre was successfully lobbied by robertson , and at the second chantilly conference ( 15–16 november 1916 ) they agreed to concentrate on the western front in 1917 rather than sending greater resources to salonika one of joffre 's last official duties ( 11 december ) was to order maurice sarrail to cease his offensive and establish a strong defensive position , from which further offensives might be launched in the future on 27 november the council of ministers met to debate rescinding the decree of 2 december 1915 , which had placed sarrail under joffre ; briand proposed that joffre be effectively demoted to commander-in-chief in north-east france , reporting to the war minister along with the commander-in-chief at salonika , although he withdrew this proposal after joffre threatened resignation he met joffre on 3 december 1916—according to joffre , promising to appoint him marshal of france and to give him a staff of his own and '' direction of the war '' 320–21 it is unclear exactly what briand had told joffre about his role ; he commented , '' this is not what they promised me , '' when reading the newspaper on the morning of 13 december and was put out to be described as '' general-in-chief '' rather than '' commander-in-chief '' however , he soon found that he had no real power—the acting war minister ( admiral lacaze , as hubert lyautey had not yet returned from north africa to take up the position ) forbade him even to approve units ' being granted the fourragère—and on 26 december , the day he was promoted marshal of france , he asked to be relieved joffre was still popular and was the first man to be promoted marshal under the third republic 11–13 the party sailed to the us on the lorraine ii , making an effort to cultivate reporters on board , who noticed how busy joffre kept his small staff 13–16 joffre stayed in washington for ten days , and addressed both houses of congress individually joffre left a paper arguing for a separate american force , then on 4 may began a week 's tour of the eastern us the 1st us infantry division , mainly regulars , was to be sent at the start of june 42–44 pershing rejected painlevé 's suggestion that joffre head the liaison group of french officers who were helping to set up his supply lines ; pershing insisted on using the atlantic ports of brest , st nazaire and rochefort 15 his major positive contributions in 1914 were his sustained calm under pressure and the calculated reasoning of an alumnus from école polytechnique , his ruthless dismissal of unsuccessful generals ( three army commanders , ten corps commanders and thirty-eight divisional commanders , neillands , robin the death of glory : the western front 1915 ( john murray , london , 2006 ) , p a french aircraft carrier bearing joffre 's name was under construction at the start of world war ii but was never completed due to france 's rapid fall in 1940
