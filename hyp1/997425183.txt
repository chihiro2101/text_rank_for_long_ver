gravity , for example , is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass therefore , it takes very sensitive equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the earth one way to search for a fifth force is with tests of the strong equivalence principle : this is one of the most powerful tests of einstein 's theory of gravity : general relativity alternative theories of gravity , such as brans–dicke theory , have a fifth force – possibly with infinite range the fifth force would manifest itself in an effect on solar system orbits , called the nordtvedt effect another kind of fifth force , which arises in kaluza–klein theory , where the universe has extra dimensions , or in supergravity or string theory is the yukawa force , which is transmitted by a light scalar field ( i.e this has prompted a lot of recent interest , as a theory of supersymmetric large extra dimensions – dimensions with size slightly less than a millimeter – has prompted an experimental effort to test gravity on these very small scales the above experiments search for a fifth force that is , like gravity , independent of the composition of an object , so all objects experience the force in proportion to their masses most physicists , however , think that dark matter and dark energy are not ad hoc , but are supported by a large number of complementary experiments and described by a very simple model this was reported through science journalism , focusing largely on the implications that the existence of the x17 particle and a corresponding fifth force would have in the search for dark matter speaking to the independent , krasznahorkay said '' if the particle ’ s existence is confirmed , it means physicists will have to finally reassess the interactions of the existing four fundamental forces of particle physics and make space for a fifth
