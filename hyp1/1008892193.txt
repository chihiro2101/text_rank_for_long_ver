the most basic form of platform consists of an area at the same level as the track , usually resulting in a fairly large height difference between the platform and the train floor the more traditional platform is elevated relative to the track but often lower than the train floor , although ideally they should be at the same level a tram stop is often in the middle of the street ; usually it has as a platform a refuge area of a similar height to that of the sidewalk , e.g sometimes a tram stop is served by ordinary trams with rather low floors and metro-like light rail vehicles with higher floors , and the tram stop has a dual-height platform trains serving a bay platform must reverse in or out at platforms 3 through to 12 are split along their length with odd numbered platforms facing north and east and even facing south and west , with a small signal halfway along the platform the term '' platform '' is also used in the us but refers to the structure rather than a designated place for a train arriving therefore , an island platform would be described as one platform with two tracks therefore , an island platform might have two numbered platforms many platforms have a cavity underneath an cantilever so that people who may fall off the platform can seek shelter from incoming trains the european union has a regulation for platforms that are close to tracks with train passing speeds of or more should not be accessible to passengers unless there is a lower speed limit for trains that intend to stop at the station or there are barriers to limit access platforms usually have some form of warnings or measures to keep passengers away from the tracks also passenger carriages are straight , so doors will not always open directly onto a curved platform & ndash ; often a platform gap is present
