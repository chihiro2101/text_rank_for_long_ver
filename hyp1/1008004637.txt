the first known greek writer to mention a sibyl is heraclitus , in the 5th century bc : the sibyl , with frenzied mouth uttering things not to be laughed at , unadorned and unperfumed , yet reaches to a thousand years with her voice by aid of the god walter burkert observes that '' frenzied women from whose lips the god speaks '' are recorded very much earlier in the near east , as in mari in the second millennium and in assyria in the first millennium '' 116 until the literary elaborations of roman writers , sibyls were not identified by a personal name , but by names that refer to the location of their temenos , or shrine in pausanias , description of greece , the first sibyl at delphi mentioned ( '' the former '' earlier ) was of great antiquity , and was thought , according to pausanias , to have been given the name '' sibyl '' by the libyans the second sibyl referred to by pausanias , and named '' herophile '' , seems to have been based ultimately in samos , but visited other shrines , at clarus , delos , and delphi and sang there , but that at the same time , delphi had its own sibyl that only two of the greek sibyls were historical : erythraean sibyl , who is thought to have lived in the 8th century bc , and samian sibyl who lived somewhat later , p.56 ) holds that two only of the greek sibyls were historical , namely herophile of erythrae and phyto of samos ; the former he thinks lived in the eighth century bc , the latter somewhat later frazer goes on : at first , the greeks seemed to have known only one sibyl the first writer who is known to have distinguished several sibyls is heraclides ponticus in his book on oracles , in which he appears to have enumerated at least three , namely the phrygian , the erythraean , and the hellespontine potter writes , '' in the late fifth century bc it does appear that 'sibylla ' was the name given to a single inspired prophetess '' david stone potter , prophecy and history in the crisis of the roman empire : a historical commentary on the thirteenth sibylline oracle , cf like heraclitus , plato speaks of only one sibyl , but in course of time the number increased to nine , with a tenth , the tiburtine sibyl , probably etruscan in origin , added by the romans the persian sibyl was said to be a prophetic priestess presiding over the apollonian oracle ; though her location remained vague enough so that she might be called the '' babylonian sibyl '' , the persian sibyl is said to have foretold the exploits of alexander the great the 2nd-century ad traveller pausanias , pausing at delphi to enumerate four sibyls , mentions the '' hebrew sibyl '' who was brought up in palestine named sabbe , whose father was berosus and her mother erymanthe 11th century bc ) mentioned by pausanias pausanias 10.12.1 writing in the 2nd century ad about stories he had heard locally the sibyl would have predated the real pythia , the oracle and priestess of apollo , originating from around the 8th century bc the word acrostic was first applied to the prophecies of the erythraean sibyl , which were written on leaves and arranged so that the initial letters of the leaves always formed a word the sibyl who most concerned the romans was the cumaean sibyl , located near the greek city of naples , whom virgil 's aeneas consults before his descent to the lower world ( aeneid book vi : 10 ) 64 kiefer , frederick , writing on the renaissance stage : written words , printed pages , metaphoric books , university of delaware press , 1996 in medieval latin , sibylla became simply the term for '' prophetess '' , and it became common in late gothic and renaissance art to depict female sibyllae alongside male prophets the basilica of santa maria in aracoeli crowning the campidoglio , rome , is particularly associated with the sibyl , because a medieval tradition referred the origin of its name to an otherwise unattested altar , ara primogeniti dei , said to have been raised to the '' firstborn of god '' by the emperor augustus , who had been warned of his advent by the sibylline books : in the church the figures of augustus and of the tiburtine sibyl are painted on either side of the arch above the high altar in the latter , shakespeare employed common renaissance comparison of cassandra to a sibyl the oldest collection of written sibylline books appears to have been made about the time of solon and cyrus at gergis on mount ida in the troad the sibyl , who was born near there , at marpessus , and whose tomb was later marked by the temple of apollo built upon the archaic site , appears on the coins of gergis , 400 & ndash ;
