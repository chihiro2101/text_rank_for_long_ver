raï is a type of algerian popular music that arose in the 1920s in the port city of oran , and that self-consciously ran counter to accepted artistic and social mores in the years just following world war i , the algerian city of oran—known as “ little paris ” —was a melting pot of various cultures , full of nightclubs and cabarets ; it was the place to go for a bawdy good time out of this milieu arose a group of male and female muslim singers called chioukhs and cheikhates , who rejected the refined , classical poetry of traditional algerian music it drew its name from the algerian arabic word raï ( “ opinion ” or “ advice ” ) , which was typically inserted—and repeated—by singers to fill time as they formulated a new phrase of improvised lyrics by the early 1940s cheikha rimitti had emerged locally as a musical and linguistic luminary in the raï tradition , and she continued to be among the music ’ s most prominent performers into the 21st century another group of female social outcasts were called cheikhas , who were known for their alluring dress , hedonistic lyrics , and their display of a form of music that was influenced from meddhahates and zendani singers the 1930s saw the rise of revolutionary organizations , including organizations motivated by marxism , which mostly despised these early roots raï singers at the same time , arabic classical music was gaining huge popularity across the maghreb , especially the music of egypt 's umm kulthum from its origins , women played a significant role in the music and performance of raï in contrast to other algerian music , raï incorporated dancing in addition to music , particularly in a mixed-gender environment musicians like mohammed belarbi and djelloul bendaoud added these influences to other oranian styles , as well as western piano and accordion , resulting in a style called bedoui citadinisé the number of public performances by female raï singers decreased , which led to men playing an increased role in this genre of music in the 1970s , recording technology began growing more advanced , and more imported genres had algerian interest as well , especially jamaican reggae with performers like bob marley this marked the beginning of pop raï , which was performed by a later generation which adopted the title of cheb ( male ) or chaba ( female ) , meaning “ young , ” to distinguish themselves from the older musicians who continued to perform in the original style however , by the time the first international raï festival was held in algeria in 1985 , cheb khaled had become virtually synonymous with the genre more festivals followed in algeria and abroad , and raï became a popular and prominent new genre in the emergent world-music market while this form of raï increased cassette sales , its association with mixed dancing , an obscene act according to orthodox islamic views , led to government-backed suppression he succeeded in getting the government to return passports to raï musicians and to allow raï to be recorded and performed in algeria , with government sponsorship , claiming it as a part of algerian cultural heritage this not only allowed the algerian government to financially gain from producing and releasing raï , but it allowed them to monitor the music and prevent the publication of '' unclean '' music and dance and still use it to benefit the algerian state 's image in the national world yet raï 's reputation as protest music stuck because the demonstrators adopted khaled 's song '' el harba wayn '' ( '' to flee , but where ? '' ) to aid their protesting : where has youth gone ? where are the brave ones ? the rich gorge themselves the poor work themselves to death the islamic charlatans show their true face though raï found mainstream acceptance in algeria , islamic fundamentalists still protested the genre , saying that it was still too liberal and too contrasting to traditional islamic values the fundamentalists claimed that the musical genre still promoted sexuality , alcohol and western consumer culture , but critics of the fundamentalist viewpoint stated that fundamentalists and raï musicians were ultimately seeking converts from the same population , the youth , who often had to choose where they belonged between the two cultures cheb khaled was the first musician with international success , including his 1988 album kutché , though his popularity did not extend to places such as the united states and latin america another mix of cultures in arabic music of the late 1990s came through franco-arabic music released by musicians such as aldo according to authors gross , mcmurray , and swedenburg in their article '' arab noise and ramadan nights : raï , rap , and franco-maghrebi identity , '' raï musician chaba zahouania was forbidden by her family to perform or even appear in public during this time of drastic restriction of female expression , many men started to become raï singers the conservativeness not only affected the way listeners received raï music , but also the way the artists , especially female artists , presented their own music
