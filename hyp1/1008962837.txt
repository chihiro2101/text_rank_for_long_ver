although tocqueville had favoured retention of distinct traditional law , administrators , schools and so on for arabs who had come under french control , he judged the berber tribes of kabylie ( in his second of two letters on algeria , 1837 ) as '' savages '' not suited for this arrangement because he argued they would best be managed not by force of arms , but by the pacifying influences of commerce and cultural interaction although in his 1841 report on algeria he applauded bugeaud for making war in a way that defeated abd-el-kader 's resistance , he had advocated in the two letters that the french military advance leave kabylie undisturbed and in subsequent speeches and writings he continued to oppose intrusion into kabylie such laws are not discussed in detail , but given that the goal of the french mission in algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense , it can be deduced that tocqueville would not concur with just war theory 's jus ad bellum criteria of just cause in 1856 , tocqueville published the old regime and the revolution tocqueville was quoted in several chapters of toby young 's memoirs how to lose friends and alienate people to explain his observation of widespread homogeneity of thought even amongst intellectual elites at harvard university during his time spent there he is frequently quoted and studied in american history classes ( 1835/1840 ) – democracy in america english language versions : tocqueville , democracy in america , trans it is tocqueville 's second most famous work recollections ( 1893 ) – this work was a private journal of the revolution of 1848 journey to america ( 1831–1832 ) – alexis de tocqueville 's travel diary of his visit to america ; translated into english by george lawrence , edited by j.-p
