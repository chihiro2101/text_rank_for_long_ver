interest rates vary according to : the government 's directives to the central bank to accomplish the government 's goals the currency of the principal sum lent or borrowed the term to maturity of the investment the perceived default probability of the borrower supply and demand in the market the amount of collateral special features like call provisions reserve requirements compensating balance as well as other factors based on the relationship between supply and demand of market interest rate , there are fixed interest rate and floating interest rate interest rate targets are a vital tool of monetary policy and are taken into account when dealing with variables like investment , inflation , and unemployment however , a low interest rate as a macro-economic policy can be risky and may lead to the creation of an economic bubble , in which large amounts of investments are poured into the real-estate market and stock market for example , the federal reserve federal funds rate in the united states has varied between about 0.25 % and 19 % from 1954 to 2008 , while the bank of england base rate varied between 0.5 % and 15 % from 1989 to 2009 , moneyextra.com interest rate history possibly before modern capital markets , there have been some accounts that savings deposits could achieve an annual return of at least 25 % and up to as high as 50 % under normal conditions , most economists think a cut in interest rates will only give a short term gain in economic activity that will soon be offset by inflation since according to time preference theory people prefer goods now to goods later , in a free market there will be a positive interest rate taxes : because some of the gains from interest may be subject to taxes , the lender may insist on a higher rate to make up for this loss banks : banks can tend to change the interest rate to either slow down or speed up economy growth in many law disputes , where interest has to be calculated , an average rate of interest has to be assumed as the legal rate for example , suppose someone deposits 100 with a bank for 1 year , and they receive interest of 10 ( before tax ) , so at the end of the year , their balance is 110 ( before tax ) the real interest rate measures the growth in real value of the loan plus interest , taking inflation into account at this zero lower bound the central bank faces difficulties with conventional monetary policy , because it is generally believed that market interest rates can not realistically be pushed down into negative territory a negative interest rate can be described ( as by gesell ) as a '' tax on holding money '' ; he proposed it as the freigeld ( free money ) component of his freiwirtschaft ( free economy ) system the existence of the negative overnight deposit rate was a technical consequence of the fact that overnight deposit rates are generally set at 0.5 % below or 0.75 % below the policy rate for practical purposes , investors and academics typically view the yields on government or quasi-government bonds guaranteed by a small number of the most creditworthy governments ( uk , usa , switzerland , eu , japan ) to effectively have negligible default risk most credit analysts value them at a spread to similar government bonds with similar duration , geographic exposure , and currency exposure forward rate list of countries by central bank interest rates macroeconomics rate of return short-rate model spot rate
