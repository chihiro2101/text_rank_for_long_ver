harvey maylor , project management in a project plan , the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time , given finite resources if resources are always available in unlimited quantities , then a project 's critical chain is identical to its critical path method implicit means that they are not included in the project network , but must be identified by looking at the resource requirements ccpm planning aggregates the large amounts of safety time added to tasks within a project into the buffersâ€”to protect due-date performance and avoid wasting this safety time through bad multitasking , student syndrome , parkinson 's law , and poorly synchronized integration a project plan or work breakdown structure ( wbs ) is created in much the same fashion as with critical path recognizing that tasks are more likely to take more time than less time due to parkinson 's law , student syndrome , or other reasons , ccpm uses '' buffers '' to monitor project schedule and financial performance in 1999 , a researcher applied simulation to assess the impact of risks associated with each component of project work breakdown structure on project duration , cost and performance , their planned duration may not be altered during the project ) , because they are used to monitor project schedule and financial performance with no slack in the duration of individual tasks , resources are encouraged to focus on the task at hand to complete it and hand it off to the next person or group each element on the project is encouraged to move as quickly as they can : when they are running their '' leg '' of the project , they should be focused on completing the assigned task as quickly as possible , with minimization of distractions and multitasking because task duration has been planned at the 50 % probability duration , there is pressure on resources to complete critical chain tasks as quickly as possible , overcoming student 's syndrome and parkinson 's law according to proponents , monitoring is , in some ways , the greatest advantage of the critical chain method
