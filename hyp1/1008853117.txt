the leaves are normally hairy with a rough texture , having uniseriate trichomes ( 1–4 rings of cells ) but sometimes they lack hairs the leaf blades in different species may have one , three or five nerves some species have linear to leaf shape leaves , and others have leaf shape ; often the leaves decrease in size as they progress up the stems most species have leaf margins that are entire , but sometimes they are leaf shape the pollen is normally yellow in most species , but usually white in e like all asteraceae , the flowering structure is a composite inflorescence , with rose-colored ( rarely yellow or white ) flower arranged in a prominent , somewhat cone-shaped head – '' cone-shaped '' because the petals of the outer ray florets tend to point downward ( are reflexed ) once the flower head opens , thus forming a cone dna analysis is applied to determine the number of echinacea species , allowing clear distinctions among species based on chemical differences in root metabolites they contain different species ( e pallida ) , different plant segments ( roots , flowers , extracts ) , different preparations ( extracts and expressed juice ) , and different chemical compositions which complicate understanding of a potential effect while one 2014 systematic review found that echinacea products are not effective to treat or prevent the common cold , a 2016 meta-analysis found tentative evidence that use of echinacea extracts reduced the risk of repeated respiratory infections a 2015 monograph by the european medicines agency stated that oral consumption of '' expressed juice '' or dried expressed juice of echinacea could prevent or reduce symptoms of a common cold at its onset one of the most extensive and systematic studies to review the safety of echinacea products concluded that overall , '' adverse events are rare , mild and reversible , '' with the most common symptoms being '' gastrointestinal and skin-related although research has not found increased risk of birth defects associated with use of echinacea during the first trimester , it is recommended that pregnant women should avoid echinacea products until stronger safety supporting evidence becomes available inconsistent process control in manufactured echinacea products may involve poor inter- and intra-batch homogeneity , species or plant part differences , variable extraction methods , and contamination or adulteration with other products , leading to potential for substantial product variability '' a comprehensive echinacea germplasm collection located at the north central regional plant introduction station '' , usda many cultivars exist , and many of them are asexually propagated to keep them true to type
