they are less closely related to other european thrush species such as the blackbird ( t at least eight subspecies have been proposed , but the differences between them are mainly clinal , with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range by their first winter they are very similar to adults , but the underparts are usually more buff-toned bonapartei is in length , and therefore slightly larger than the nominate form birds of intermediate appearance are seen west of the ob river where the range overlaps with viscivorus trureetruuruu or similar , repeated three to six times , and used to advertise his territory , attract a mate and maintain the pair bond the mistle thrush breeds in much of europe and temperate asia , although it is absent from the treeless far north , and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast europe , turkey and the middle east the southern form t breeding birds in the british isles and north-west europe are resident or move only short distances migration may be by day or night , and typically involves individuals or small groups breeding occurs at up to in the mountains of north africa , and occasionally much higher , to there is evidence that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range perhaps the most notable find of the 118th christmas bird count in canada was a single vagrant mistle thrush found in miramichi , new brunswick this was the first record for this species in north america mistle thrushes are found as individuals or pairs for much of the year , although families forage together in late summer , and groups may merge to form large flocks when food sources are plentiful it is not uncommon for up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year they roost at night in trees or bushes , again typically as individuals or pairs , except in late summer or autumn when families may roost together their territories are much larger than those of blackbirds or song thrushes ; although the nest territory is only about , around is used for feeding the nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk , although hedges , ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used the nest site may be up to above the ground , although is more typical the nest is built by the female , although the male may help nests built early in the breeding season may be destroyed by bad weather the clutch is typically three to five eggs ( range two to six ) , which are usually whitish-buff or greenish-blue and are spotted with red , purple or brown life expectancy is typically three years , but the maximum age recorded from bird ringing recoveries is 21 & nbsp ; years and 3 & nbsp ; months for a bird shot in switzerland young birds are initially mainly fed on invertebrates , often collected from low foliage or under bushes rather than in the grassland preferred by the adults individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter , with preference shown for trees which host mistletoe , the parasitic plant from which the bird derives its name although the thrush normally feeds on the ground and from low bushes , the defence of this resource conserves fruit for later in the season when other food items become scarce internally , they can suffer from parasites including cestoda , rothschild & clay ( 1953 ) p the mistle thrush has an extensive distribution in europe and western asia , and its european breeding population is estimated at 9–22.2 & nbsp ; million birds when asian breeders are added , this gives a global total of 12.2–44.4 & nbsp ; million the species was formerly more restricted in range , and rarely bred even in northern england in the 1700s it expanded rapidly into lowland and coastal areas of europe during the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century , colonising areas where it was formerly rare or absent , such as ireland ( where it first bred in 1807 ) , scotland and the netherlands given its high numbers and very large range , this thrush is therefore classified by the international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern in finland , the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline the loud call of this common and conspicuous bird also led to many old or local names , including '' screech '' , '' shrite '' and '' gawthrush '' other names , including '' stormcock '' referred to its willingness to sing in wind and rain
