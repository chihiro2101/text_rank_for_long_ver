edison incorporated various elements into his phonograph that would become staples that can be found in recording devices to this day for a sound to be recorded by the phonograph , it has to go through three distinct steps in order to playback the sound recorded on one of the tinfoil cylinders , the recording process is essentially reversed this lack of sound quality is why the phonograph was originally used to record speeches , meetings , and telephone calls , rather than music berliner 's main improvement to the phonograph was related to the component of the device that actually held the recorded information what he came up with was not a cylinder at all , but was rather a flat circular disc much like modern vinyl records this quality allowed for the mass production of recorded discs , which was the first step towards commercially recorded music unfortunately , though the gramophone was a large step up from the phonograph commercially , it still had many of the same problems the mass production possibilities created by berliner â€™ s flat discs got companies thinking about recording music , but since nothing had been done to address the low fidelity issue , the industry had yet to really take off this machine was vastly different from the gramophone or the phonograph , in that instead of recording sound mechanically , it recorded using a process called magnetic storage poulsen was able to transmit an electrical signal , much like the one that would broadcast over the radio or a telephone , and then capture it on a magnetizable element , in this case a length of steel wire , which was wrapped around a bass drum like the recording devices that came before it , the telegraphone recordings were nearly impossible to edit this is the method all recording studios use to this day , in order to record all of the separate instruments of a song , and get the best possible takes from all of the musicians nowadays , while digital recording to flash memory and hard disk has largely supplanted magnetic tape for most purposes , tape as a verb and as a noun has remained the common parlance for the recording process
