wikipedia usernames are case sensitive , but the first letter is always automatically capitalized the software will not allow you to register with a username that is already in use , or one that appears too similar to one that is already in use special : centralauth can be used to check whether a username is already taken or not ; if it is not listed there you can easily register it , unless it is too similar to an existing one the following types of username are not permitted because they may be misleading in a way that disrupts the project : usernames that impersonate other people ( see and below ) usernames that appear similar to naming conventions used by community administrative processes , such as those starting with vanished user ( see wikipedia : courtesy vanishing ) ( usernames which represent the subject of a biographical article are not considered promotional ; see email addresses and urls ( such as '' alice example.com '' and '' example.com '' ) that promote a commercial web page and do n't simply identify a person ) are sometimes acceptable , such as when the purpose is simply to identify the user as a person , they are inappropriate if they promote a commercial web page if there is evidence that the user would continue to edit inappropriately under a new username , the blocking administrator should enable the '' autoblock '' and '' prevent account creation '' features otherwise , the user should be offered the opportunity to create a new account because wikipedia 's policy is that usernames should not be shared between more than one individual , the following types of usernames are not permitted because they imply shared use : usernames that are simply names of companies or groups are not permitted ( these also fall under above ) if you choose to edit articles that are in any way related to your company or group , you will need to carefully follow wikipedia 's advice on editing with a conflict of interest this includes : symbols and characters unrelated to the list of writing systems symbols and characters that are on the block lists at unicode symbols users with such names should be offered the opportunity for renaming their account or creating a new one ( see dealing with inappropriate usernames below ) if you see a username that is problematic but was not obviously created in bad faith , politely draw the user 's attention to this policy , and try to encourage them to create a new account with a different username generally , editors whose usernames are a technical or borderline violation of the username policy should be given an opportunity to discuss the username and how they may register a new username however , users who are reluctant to register a new username and are otherwise showing a positive history of contributions to wikipedia should be allowed to continue editing in a positive fashion and the matter should be dropped consider carefully before creating an account in your real name or a nickname which might be traced to you , as these increase the potential for harassment , especially if you edit in controversial subject areas do not edit under a name that is likely to imply that you are ( or are related to ) a specific , identifiable person , unless it is your real name if a name is used that implies that the user is ( or is related to ) a specific , identifiable person , the account may sometimes be blocked as a precaution against damaging impersonation , until proof of identity is provided the best way will vary , but could be by using a mail address on a domain name that belongs to you or sending out a tweet using a verified account usernames that are very similar to existing ones can not be registered normallybut if you do want to use one , you may request its creation at wikipedia : request an account the program that checks for similarity is a bit over-sensitiveif the username is different enough as to prevent other people from confusing the two users , the request should be approved if your username is similar to that of another contributor or an article , you may wish to provide some form of disambiguation , such as by adding to the top of your user page if your username is commonly misspelled , consider helping people by adding redirects to your actual user page and talk page from the misspelled titles the software prevents registration of certain names that are found to be too similar to existing ones ; if you can not register your doppelgänger username for this reason , you should visit wikipedia : request an account anonymous users in that time were treated in one of two ways : domain names : up until about march 2001 , an editor with an ip address '' 192.0.2.34 '' that was associated with domain name '' host.2.34.example.net '' would have their edit logged as being by '' host.2.34.example.net '' these usernames are usually wp : block on sight , as a ) they do n't make good usernames in light of the above criteria , b ) they were never true usernames in the first place and would thus have been abandoned with changing software , and c ) modern software is such that an innocent contributor editing from the '' host.2.34.example.net '' server would not be affected by a block of '' user : host.2.34.example.net '' sharing an account – or the password to an account – with others is not permitted , and evidence of doing so will result in the user being required to stop the practice and change their password , or in sanctions ( up to and including the account being blocked ) , depending on circumstances it is recommended that contributors not use multiple accounts without good reason for example , a user may wish to create an alternate account for use on public computers as a precaution to keep their primary account more secure signatures on discussion pages will continue to use the old name ; while these can be changed manually , it is not recommended unless a contributor wishes to remove as much information as possible about their former name for privacy reasons see bug 32815 editors seeking privacy per courtesy vanishing / right to vanish can usually have their accounts renamed and their user pages ( and in exceptional cases user talk pages ) deleted
