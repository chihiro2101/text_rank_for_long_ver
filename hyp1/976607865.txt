this is usually an arid environment with a small basin fed by a limited input of water when scientists evaporate ocean water in a laboratory , the minerals are deposited in a defined order that was first demonstrated by usiglio in 1884 at this point , the mineral gypsum begins to form , which is then followed by halite at 10 % , excluding carbonate minerals that tend not to be evaporites non-marine evaporites are usually composed of minerals that are not common in marine environments because in general the water from which non-marine evaporite precipitates has proportions of chemical elements different from those found in the marine environments non-marine deposits may also contain halite , gypsum , and anhydrite , and may in some cases even be dominated by these minerals , although they did not come from ocean deposits evaporite depositional environments that meet the above conditions include : graben areas and half-grabens within continental rift environments fed by limited riverine drainage , usually in subtropical or tropical environments example environments at the present that match this is the denakil depression , ethiopia ; death valley , california graben environments in oceanic rift environments fed by limited oceanic input , leading to eventual isolation and evaporation examples include the red sea , and the dead sea in jordan and israel internal drainage basins in arid to semi-arid temperate to tropical environments fed by ephemeral drainage example environments at the present include the simpson desert , western australia , the great salt lake in utah non-basin areas fed exclusively by groundwater seepage from artesian waters example environments include the seep-mounds of the victoria desert , fed by the great artesian basin , australia restricted coastal plains in regressive sea environments examples include the sabkha deposits of iran , saudi arabia , and the red sea ; the garabogazk√∂l of the caspian sea drainage basins feeding into extremely arid environments examples include the chilean deserts , certain parts of the sahara , and the namib the most significant known evaporite depositions happened during the messinian salinity crisis in the basin of the mediterranean a.jorgensen and c.j.cleveland , national council for science and the environment , washington dc for a formation to be recognised as evaporitic it may simply require recognition of halite pseudomorphs , sequences composed of some proportion of evaporite minerals , and recognition of mud crack textures or other textures thick halite deposits are expected to become an important location for the disposal of nuclear waste because of their geologic stability , predictable engineering and physical behaviour , and imperviousness to groundwater halite formations are famous for their ability to form diapirs , which produce ideal locations for trapping petroleum deposits this is a chart that shows minerals that form the marine evaporite rocks , they are usually the most common minerals that appear in this kind of deposit evaporite minerals start to precipitate when their concentration in water reaches such a level that they can no longer exist as solutes
