smith , an archeologist with the carnegie institute , estimated 10–12,000 people lived within the walled city gregory simons survey outside the city walls , there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000–17,000 people people living outside of the city wall engaged in agriculture , animal-raising , and specialized activities such as lime production russell also found a colonnaded hall outside the city wall , revealing much is still to be discovered regarding the complexity of this urban landscape however , the mayapan temple appears to be an inferior imitation of the one at chichen itza , and the city 's buildings in general are not constructed as well as those in other mayan cities other major temples in the ceremonial center include three round ones , which are unusual for the maya area and are also linked to the deity kukulkan/quetzalcoatl in his wind god ( ehecatl ) aspect the new city was built within a defensive wall and named mayapan , meaning '' standard of the maya people '' the chief of the cocom family , a rich and ancient lineage that had taken part in the revolt against chichen , was chosen to be king , and all the other noble families and regional lords were to send members of their families to mayapan to play parts in the government ( and perhaps act as hostages for the good behavior of the subsidiary cities ) another family , the xiu , may have been living in the mayapan area prior to the arrival of the cocom ; the xiu claim to be a part of the lineage from uxmal ( an alternative account is given in a maya chronicle from the colonial era , claiming that mayapan was contemporary with chichen itza and uxmal and allied with those cities , but archeological evidence shows this version to be less likely archaeological evidence indicates that at least the ceremonial center was burned at the end of the occupation stephens was the first to document parts of the mayapan site with two important illustrations he was the first in a long string of explorers who drew the ruins of mayapan these surveys mapped the main plaza group and the city wall , and were the basis of later maps ( russell 2008 ) the current reports have recently been republished in their entirety by the university of colorado press ( john weeks 2009 ) several years later , the national institute of anthropology and history ( inah ) of mexico began extensive architectural excavations and consolidation under the direction of archaeologist carlos peraza lope this work continues to the present this '' economic foundations of mayapan '' ( pemy ) project performed mapping , surface survey and collection , test-pitting , and horizontal excavation across the city this project has also identified a probable major market plaza in square k ( between the site center and major north gate d ) ; richard terry , bruce dahlin , and daniel bair have analyzed soil samples from this location to test the function of this locality in 2008 and 2009 , the pemy project focused excavations on an outlying ceremonial group by the far eastern city gate ( gate h ) , known as itzmal ch'en , as part of its study of the economic and social links between governing elites and distant neighborhoods within the city according to robert smith , the ceramicist for the carnegie institution , there were two ceramic phases in mayapan : hocaba , which he said started around a.d 1200 and may have included types named mama red and navula unslipped , more commonly associated with southern lowland settlements : in an alley fill between the templo redondo and an adjoining hall , some charcoal was found that yielded a calibrated date of 540–820 b.c researchers think that this sample represented old charcoal that predated the context in which it was found : charcoal was found on the upper floor of one of the temples that was dated to a.d three separate samples form the frame for early mayapan occupation however , two of these dates come from inexact sources one was burned copal found in an unknown structure ( apparently the label had eroded off of the structure ) ; the researchers inferred that it was q-95 the early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in mayapan 's early history charcoal found in the early construction phase of the site 's main pyramid was dated a.d mayapan 's settlement pattern radiated outwards to its fringes over time ; many of the later dates are from materials outside of the main group of ruins 8 kukulcan 's realm : urban life at ancient mayapán , marilyn masson & carlos peraza lope , university press of colorado 2014 , chapter 8 : militarism , misery and collapse there is evidence that the area around mayapan was regularly used for slash-and-burn agriculture peraza lope in 2008 looked at faunal remains from two different middens , one located in the monumental center by some houses , and the other is located in the domestic area outside the monumental compound these percentages as well as the ones that will follow for the settlement zone are based on recognized remains within the ceremonial center , numerous deer heads and teeth were found among the remains mayapan was a major capital in the yucatán , and there is extensive evidence that it had far-reaching trade routes , as seen in architecture and artifacts of other settlements in the region zacpeten on lake salpeten & nbsp ; – incense burners found at this site are nearly identical to those found at mayapan also , tiny “ dwarf ” shrines found at this site were very similar to shrines found at mayapan the two sites appear to have been abandoned around the same time ; which may suggest a connection between their governments this evidence suggests a : “ circum-yucatecan trade route that linked mayapan to peten , northern belize , and east-coast sites in the late postclassic period the symbolism present in mayapan is particularly significant , partially because the center of the site is mainly used for ritual purposes symbols that they have in common include : : the sun disc ( there are varying interpretations of what this represents : : could represent the sun god : : however , the diving posture of the figure within the disc is a common motif used to represent a dead warrior , and because the figure is represented bound and with his heart removed it has been interpreted as a representation of a warrior sacrificed to the sun god east and west were of primary importance because it represented the track of the sun through the sky this has led many sources to believe that the itza and the xiw may have been associated with east and west some sources indicate that the analysis of oratarios or god-houses ( large house-like shrines ) show boundaries that were known to the people of mayapan however , written records state that the site was abandoned in a.d evidence of burned wood was found inside of structure y-45a as well as burned roofing material on many of the other structures that was dated to around the time of the collapse in k ’ atun 8 ahua ( roughly a.d from this they have posited that the complex was abandoned finally when the city fell ( lope 2006 ; milbrath 2003 ) 1461 there is little evidence of altars and burial cists being constructed after 1461 , suggesting that the site had been abandoned by this point ( lope 2006 ) very little evidence has been found to support later usage of mayapan however , these samples date to the industrial era and may not be valid , so any assumptions based on this evidence would also not be valid ( lope 2006:168 ) ( 2006 ) '' water sources at mayapán , yucatán , méxico , '' in precolumbian water management : ideology , ritual , and power , edited by lisa lucero and barbara fash , pp 171–188 in the carnegie maya ii : carnegie institution of washington current reports , 1952–1957 , edited by john weeks , pp '' evidence for maya-mexican interaction in the archaeological record of mayapan '' , in astronomers , scribes , and priests : intellectual interchange between the northern maya lowlands and highland mexico in the late postclassic period , edited by gabrielle vail and christine hernandez , pp '' revisting mayapan : mexico ’ s last maya capital '' , ancient mesoamerica 14:1–47 , carlos peraza lope 2009 survival and revival of terminal classic traditions at postclassic mayapán latin american antiquity : a journal of the society for american archaeology 20 ( 4 ) :581–606 tatiana proskouriakoff ( 1962 ) civic and religious structures at mayapán , in “ introduction , ” in mayapán , yucatan , mexico , by harry e “ mayapan ” in international dictionary of historic places , volume i : americas en royal courts of the maya , volume two : data and case studies , edited by takeshi inomata and stephen d '' traditional burnt-lime production at mayapán , mexico '' , journal of field archaeology 32:407-423 ledyard smith ( 1962 ) '' residential and associated structures at mayapán '' , in mayapán yucatan mexico , edited by h.e.d
