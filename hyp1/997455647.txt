to find out what someone 's number would be without compiling a list , one must first trace how they relate back to the subject or person of interest , meaning one records that someone is the subject 's father 's mother 's mother 's father 's father 's & nbsp ; use the definition that a father 's number will be twice that individual 's number , or a mother 's will be twice plus one , and just multiply and add 1 accordingly write down the digit '' 1 '' , which represents the subject , then from left to right write '' 0 '' for each father and '' 1 '' for each mother in the relation , ending with the ancestor of interest we can also work in reverse to find what the relation is from the number if it is even , the last part is '' father , '' and one divides by 2 an ancestor may have two or more numbers due to pedigree collapse in the german language , the term '' ahnentafel '' may refer to a list of coats of arms and names of one 's ancestors , even when it does not follow the numbered tabular representation given above
