for example , the hp 59501 power supply programmer and hp 59306a relay actuator were both relatively simple hp-ib peripherals implemented in ttl , without the need for a microprocessor these standards formalized the mechanical , electrical , and basic protocol parameters of gpib , but said nothing about the format of commands or data ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 provided for basic syntax and format conventions , as well as device-independent commands , data structures , error protocols , and the like scpi added standard generic commands , and a series of instrument classes with corresponding class-specific commands the standard allows up to 15 devices to share a single physical bus of up to total cable length control and data transfer functions are logically separated ; a controller can address one device as a '' talker '' and one or more devices as '' listeners '' without having to participate in the data transfer hp 's designers did not specifically plan for ieee & nbsp ; 488 to be a peripheral interface for general-purpose computers ; the focus was on instrumentation hp computer peripherals which did not utilize the rs-232 communication interface often used hp-ib including disc systems like the hp 7935 other manufacturers adopted gpib for their computers as well , such as with the tektronix 405x line the commodore pet ( introduced 1977 ) range of personal computers connected their peripherals using the ieee & nbsp ; 488 bus , but with a non-standard card edge connector commodore 's following 8-bit machines utilized a serial bus whose protocol was based on ieee & nbsp ; 488 reverse-engineered schematics for commodore c64 ieee interface several third party suppliers of commodore 64 peripherals made a cartridge for the c64 that provided an ieee & nbsp ; 488-derived interface on a card edge connector similar to that of the pet series eventually , faster , more complete standards such as scsi superseded ieee & nbsp ; 488 for peripheral access the hardware interface enabled devices made by different manufacturers to communicate with a single host although the electrical and physical interfaces were well defined , there was not an initial standard command set devices from different manufacturers might use different commands for the same function more recent standards such as usb , firewire , and ethernet take advantage of declining costs of interface electronics to implement more complex standards providing higher bandwidth
