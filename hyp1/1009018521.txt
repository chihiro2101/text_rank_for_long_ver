at some point st-calais also acquired a knowledge of canon law he became a benedictine monk at saint-calais in maine , where his father had become a monk , and soon became the prior of that house 241 greenway fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066–1300 : volume 2 : monastic cathedrals ( northern and southern provinces ) : durham : bishops his elevation may have been a reward for diplomatic services he rendered to the king in france , barlow english church p 64 or to help secure the see from further disorder following the death of the previous bishop , william walcher , during a feud 42 and moved a small community of monks from bede 's old monastery at jarrow to durham , to form the new chapter 328 after the community had settled in durham , st-calais named eadwine as prior , and arranged for lands to be set aside to support the monks the expelled clergy were offered the option of joining the new monastic house , but only one actually joined st-calais enjoyed good relations with his cathedral chapter , and they supported him when construction began on a new church in 1093 169–170 after demolishing an old saxon church , he and prior turgot of durham laid the foundation stone on 11 august 1093 for what would later become durham cathedral 131 symeon of durham said that the bishop acted towards the monks of his chapter as a '' loving father '' , and that the monks fully returned the sentiment almost always during the conqueror 's reign , st-calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops 47 some historians , including david bates , have argued that st-calais was the driving force behind the organization of the entire domesday survey , chaplais '' william of saint-calais '' domesday studies pp 201 although other candidates have been put forward , including samson , bishop of worcester , before he became bishop 68–70 pierre chaplais , who argues for st-calais being the main organizer of the survey , argues the bishop 's exile in 1088 interrupted work on the little domesday book , a subproject of the survey which was left uncompleted soon after the accession of william rufus , st-calais became one of the king 's most trusted lieutenants , mason william ii pp 100–104 later chroniclers often referred to the position that st-calais held as justiciar , although the formal office did not yet exist aird , have suggested that st-calais felt the division of the conqueror 's realm between two sons was unwise 49 but st-calais continued to hold out in durham , at first claiming he had never actually rebelled st-calais was brought before the king and royal court for trial on 2 november 1088 , at salisbury , barlow william rufus p lending support to their belief is the fact that st-calais never pursued his appeal to rome , and that later , in 1095 , he took the side of the king against anselm of canterbury when anselm tried to assert a right to appeal to rome during the course of the trial , lanfranc is said to have stated that the court was '' trying you not in your capacity as bishop , but in regard to your fief ; and in this way we judged the bishop of bayeux in regard to his fief before the present king 's father , and that king did not summon him to that plea as bishop but as brother and earl 285 unlike the later case of thomas becket , st-calais received little sympathy from his fellow bishops 285–286 the final judgement was only reached after the king lost his temper and exclaimed : '' believe me , bishop , you 're not going back to durham , and your men are n't going to stay at durham , and you 're not going to go free , until you release the castle the historian mark philpott , however , argues that st-calais was knowledgeable in canon law , since he owned a copy of the canon law , the pseudo-isidore , which still survives once the castle was back under the king 's control , st-calais was released , and exiled ; he left for normandy , and no more was heard of his appeal to rome 209 pope urban ii did write to the king in 1089 requesting that st-calais be restored to his see , but nothing came of it 108 footnote 1 duke robert had persuaded the king to allow bishop william 's return , perhaps in recognition of a service st-calais performed for the king by brokering the end of a siege in normandy that the king 's forces were about to lose for the rest of his life , st-calais remained a frequent advisor to the king 182–185 later , when the king was negotiating with walter of albano , the papal legate sent by urban to convey the pallium to anselm and to secure the king 's recognition of urban as pope , st-calais was the king 's chief negotiator both the english king and st-calais did all in their power to support malcolm 's sons , who had been educated in england , in their attempts to secure the scottish throne later , in 1095 , an english noble , robert de mowbray , who was earl of northumbria , challenged the bishop 's authority in the north 354–355 the death of malcolm and the capture of mowbray did much to make the north more secure 111–124 st-calais also ordered the destruction of the old cathedral that had been built by aldhun , to make way for the construction of a new , larger cathedral , the current romanesque-style durham cathedral 283 however , st-calais ' exile after his trial as well as his employment in the royal service meant that he was often absent from his bishopric , and this probably is the cause of the medieval chronicler symeon of durham 's comparatively neutral treatment of st-calais in his works st-calais appears to have been a devotee of the cult , and the most likely date for the creation of the confraternity link between the two houses is during st-calais ' time as bishop 163–164 in 1796 st-calais ' grave was supposedly found during the demolition of the chapter house at durham cathedral brooke english church and the papacy p brooke english church and the papacy p brooke english church and the papacy p
