the trio began to practice together in raynor 's bedroom , spending hours together writing music , attending punk shows and movies , and playing practical jokes the trio first operated under a variety of names , including duck tape and figure 8 , until delonge rechristened the band '' blink '' the band 's first performance was at a local high school during lunch , and soon the trio graduated to san diego 's spirit club and influential local shop alley kat records & nbsp ; 15-17 delonge called clubs constantly in san diego asking for a spot to play , as well as calling up local high schools convincing them that blink was a '' motivational band with a strong anti-drug message '' in hopes to play at an assembly or lunch 21 the band soon became part of a circuit that also included the likes of ten foot pole and unwritten law , and they found their way onto the bill as the opening band for local acts at soma , a local all-ages venue which they longed to headline the band 's equipment was piled into a blue station wagon for touring purposes and they first began to play shows outside san diego 14-16 '' at that point they 'd played around enough to get their chops up so i took all the money i had in savings and we went into the studio for two days , '' said secor despite this , the band carried on and the demo was complete within two days two days and they were done – including the mix '' the trio were '' super stoked '' about a sound effects tape they found at the studio , and took time out to add in applause and laughter tracks because they deemed it humorous blink also recorded joke tracks , as they felt that , in addition to the serious songs , '' it was almost as important to make people laugh '' delonge recalled that the band spent more time at the end of production on buddha trying to perfect the joke songs rather than their serious tracks secor helped the band sign to cargo music in 1994 using his connections at the label ; he felt that by helping the briskly growing band sign a deal he could build his own label , filter records , in the wake of blink 's success he alleged that cargo music began calling him and making threats , and he could not afford to fight back and was unlikely to win since he had no written contract with the band the band began to grow suspicious that secor was keeping all the money from selling copies of the buddha cassette , and contacted their lawyer , joe escalante of the vandals , who also owned independent record label kung fu records '' secor felt it was his right to sell his stock of the cassettes , since the band '' had been paid royalties for that already '' they 'd already sold 60,000 copies of cheshire cat , said escalante , '' and i thought , 'man , if i can sell just 10 % of that that would be great for the label , ' and of course it sold a lot more because they went on to be superstars '' this fast and furious beauty may have been recorded in two days , but it soon had the labels knocking at delonge and co ’ s door , '' said total guitar in 2012
