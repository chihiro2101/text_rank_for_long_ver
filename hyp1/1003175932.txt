the age of the site has been significantly refined over the last century from 1910 to 1945 , arthur posnansky maintained that the site was 11,000–17,000 years old based on comparisons to geological eras and archaeoastronomy this date is still seen in some publications and museums in bolivia most recently , a statistical assessment of reliable radiocarbon dates estimates that the site was founded around ad 110 ( 50–170 , 68 % probability ) , a date supported by the lack of ceramic styles from earlier periods this was nearly destroyed by a deep looting excavation that extends from the center of this structure to its eastern side later it was considered a boundary between the ceremonial center and the urban area yellow and red clay was used in different areas for what seems like aesthetic purposes since the late 20th century , researchers have theorized that this was not the gateway 's original location the walls are covered with tenon heads of many different styles , suggesting that the structure was reused for different purposes over time within many of the site 's structures are impressive gateways ; the ones of monumental scale are placed on artificial mounds , platforms , or sunken courts these architectural examples , as well as the recently discovered akapana gate , have unique detail and demonstrate high skill in stone-cutting inside the walls were many images devoted to human origin , which only the elites would see other damage was committed by people quarrying stone for building and railroad construction , and target practice by military personnel no standing buildings have survived at the modern site the ashlar blocks used in many of these structures were mass-produced in similar styles so that they could possibly be used for multiple purposes throughout the period of the site , certain buildings changed purposes , causing a mix of artifacts found today detailed study of tiwanaku began on a small scale in the mid-nineteenth century german geologist alphons stübel spent nine days in tiwanaku in 1876 , creating a map of the site based on careful measurements the reconstruction was not sufficiently based on research ; for instance , a new wall was built around kalasasaya as noted , the gateway of the sun , now in the kalasasaya , is believed to have been moved from its original location evidence of similar types of cranial vault modification in burials between the omo site and the main site of tiwanaku is also being used for this argument the proyecto arqueologico pumapunku-akapana ( pumapunku-akapana archaeological project , papa ) run by the university of pennsylvania , has been excavating in the area surrounding the pyramid for the past few years , and also conducting ground penetrating radar surveys of the area in former years , an archaeological field school offered through harvard 's summer school program , conducted in the residential area outside the monumental core , has provoked controversy amongst local archaeologists the restoration had consisted of facing the pyramid with adobe , although researchers had not established this as appropriate these structures spanned over 411 hectares , and included a stone temple and about one hundred circular or rectangular structures of vast dimensions , which were possibly domestic units .
