hayom yom , introduction according to meir perels of prague , the maharal was the great-great-grandson of judah leib the elder who allegedly descended paternally from hai gaon and therefore also from the davidic line , however several modern historians such as otto muneles and shlomo engard have criticized this claim by the time he was eight years old , he wrote an all-inclusive commentary on the torah based on the works of rashi , nahmanides and abraham ibn ezra 'sipurie chassidim lenoar ' kfar chabad 1984 until the age of twelve , he studied under issachar ber in lyubavichi ( lubavitch ) ; he distinguished himself as a talmudist , such that his teacher sent him back home , informing his father that the boy could continue his studies without the aid of a teacher during these years , shneur zalman was introduced to mathematics , geometry and astronomy by two learned brothers , refugees from bohemia , who had settled in liozna one of them was also a scholar of the kabbalah in the course of the hasidic movement 's establishment , opponents ( misnagdim ) arose among the local jewish community an encounter with the alter rebbe - program one hundred sixty eight - living torah his accession was disputed by one of his father 's prime students , aharon halevi of strashelye , however the majority of shneur zalman 's followers stayed with schneuri , and moved to lubavichi thus , while schneuri succeeded his father as rebbe of the chabad movement , a senior disciple of his father , aharon halevi of strashelye , a popular and respected figure , differed with him on a number of issues and led a breakaway movement while many more became followers of dovber shneuri , the strashelye school of chassidic thought was the subject of many of dovber 's discourses aharon halevi emphasized the importance of basic emotions in divine service ( especially the service of prayer ) during the latter portion of dovber 's life , his students dispersed over europe , and after dovber 's death , shneur zalman became the leader of hasidism in lithuania , along with his senior colleague menachem mendel of vitebsk 251–252 he was also active in canvassing financial support for the jewish settlements in the land of israel , then under the control of the ottoman empire as shneur zalman , founder of the chabad intellectual school in hasidism , shared the same hebrew birthday ( 18th of ellul , some 47 years apart ) with the baal shem tov , founder of the whole hasidic movement , habad tradition identifies them symbolically with the 2 great luminaries of the 4th day of creation ( genesis 1:16 : '' and god made the two great luminaries : the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night '' audio recording talk , '' the beginning of the end '' of the jewish year , by yitzchak ginsburgh , explaining the kabbalistic meaning of 18th ellul '' : politics and spirituality in early modern jewish messianism , hillel levine , jerusalem studies in jewish thought 16–17 , 2001 some argue that shneur zalman 's opposition stemmed from napoleon 's attempts to arouse a messianic view of himself in jews , opening the gates of the ghettos and emancipating their residents as he conquered he established an ersatz sanhedrin , recruiting jews to his ranks , and spreading rumors about his conquest of the holy land to make jews subversive for his own ends yisroel hopsztajn of kozienice , another hasidic leader , also considered napoleon a menace to the jewish people , a in 1797 following the death of the gaon , leaders of the vilna community accused the hasidim of subversive activities - on charges of supporting the ottoman empire , since shneur zalman advocated sending charity to support jews living in the ottoman territory of palestine in chabad tradition , his imprisonment is interpreted as a reflection of accusations in heaven that he was revealing his new dimensions of mystical teachings too widely in the hasidic story of an earlier episode among the '' holy society '' disciples of dov ber of mezeritch , one of the great followers saw a page of hasidic writings blowing around the courtyard concluded schneur zalman in defence of hasidic dissemination , the king represents god , and the son represents the jewish community , who recognise the '' god of israel '' at the time of the emerging hasidic movement , the jewish people were at a physical and spiritual low ebb the only cure would be the dissemination of the inner divine teachings of hasidic thought chabad commentary asks about this the question of why a new heavenly accusation would have arisen against shneur zalman himself , and result in his incarceration in st had he not already received the heavenly agreement to the wisdom of disseminating chassidic teachings ?
