similar to the asch conformity experiments , a study done on groups of preschool children showed that they were influenced by groups of their peers to change their opinion to a demonstrably wrong one when asked in the presence of the other children , the last child 's response was often the same as his or her peers however , when allowed to privately share their responses with a researcher the children proved much more resistant to their peers ' pressure , illustrating the importance of the physical presence of their peers in shaping their opinions the study focused on three children who were clearly identified as being more disruptive than their peers , and looked at their responses to potential techniques the system utilized was a two-part one : first , each student would be given points by their teachers for correctly completing tasks with little disruption ( e.g even small children , then , are susceptible to pressure from their peers , and that pressure can be used to effect positive change in academic and social environments children entering this period in life become aware for the first time of the other people around them and realize the importance of perception in their interactions peer pressure is commonly associated with episodes of adolescent risk taking because these activities commonly occur in the company of peers even though socially accepted children often have the most opportunities and the most positive experiences , research shows that social acceptance ( being in the popular crowd ) may increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior , depending on the norms in the group groups of popular children showed a propensity to increase risky , drug-related and delinquent behavior when this behavior was likely to receive approval in their groups gender also has a clear effect on the amount of peer pressure an adolescent experiences : girls report significantly higher pressures to conform to their groups in the form of clothing choices or speech patterns additionally , girls and boys reported facing differing amounts of pressures in different areas of their lives , perhaps reflecting a different set of values and priorities for each gender peer pressure is widely recognized as a major contributor to the initiation of drug use , particularly in adolescence for example , parental monitoring is negatively associated with substance use ; yet when there is little monitoring , adolescents are more likely to succumb to peer coercion during initiation to substance use , but not during the transition from experimental to regular use also available as : caldwell and colleagues extended this work by finding that peer pressure was a factor leading to heightened risk in the context of social gatherings with little parental monitoring , and if the individual reported themselves as vulnerable to peer pressure substance use is likely not attributed to peer pressure alone in a nationally representative sample , adolescents who had genetic predisposition were more likely to have good friends who were heavy substance users and were furthermore , more likely to be vulnerable to the adverse influence of these friends this suggests that social contexts do not play the significant role in substance use initiation and maintenance as it may for others and that interventions for these individuals should be developed with genetics in mind as well though the impact of peer influence in adolescence has been well established , it was unclear at what age this effect begins to diminish it is accepted that such peer pressure to use alcohol or illicit substances is less likely to exist in elementary school and very young adolescents given the limited access and exposure using the resistance to peer influence scale , sumter and colleagues found that resistance to peer pressure grew as age increased in a large study of 10- to 18-year-old parental social support , consistent discipline ) have been shown to be an important contributor to the ability to resist peer pressure to use substances it is believed that peer pressure of excessive drinking in college comes down to three factors ; being offered alcohol , modeling and social norms there are two reasons why people do it ; because everyone does it , or as a means to fit into social groups the known correlational relationship between substance use and relationships with others that use makes resistance skills a natural treatment target this type of training is meant to help individuals refuse participation with substance use while maintaining their membership in the peer group a study in los angeles and orange counties that established conservative norms and attempted to correct children 's beliefs about substance abuse among their peers showed a statistically significant decrease in alcohol , tobacco , and marijuana use but other studies that systematically reviewed school-based attempts to prevent alcohol misuse in children found '' no easily discernible pattern '' in both successful and failed programs in a non-substance context , however , research has showed that decision-making training can produce concrete gains in risk perception and decision-making ability among autistic children when administered the training in several short sessions that taught the children how to recognize risk from peers and react accordingly , the children showed through post-training assessments that they were able to identify potential threats and sources of pressure from peers and deflect them far better than normal adolescents in a control group they found a number of unhealthy practices derived from peer pressure : condoms are derided , threats of ridicule for abstinence , and engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners as part of a status symbol ( especially for males ) an important solution for these problems is communication with adults , which the study found to be extremely lacking within adolescent social groups literature reviews in this field have attempted to analyze the norms present in the interactions and decision making behind these behaviors the last norm defined by the study is called '' peer pressure '' by the authors , and is used to describe direct encouragement or pressure by a person 's peers to engage in sexual behavior between the two indirect norms , descriptive norms had a stronger effect : people were likely to try what they thought their peers were engaging in rather than what they thought had approval in their peer group the more trouble a subject had with self-regulation and self-control growing up , the more they were likely to fall prey to peer pressure that would lead them to engage in risky sexual acts based on these findings , it may be a good idea to prevent these through either a decision-making program or by targeting adolescents ' ability to self-regulate against possible risks without both present and functional , it would be difficult to determine the value of action based upon social circumstances according to treynor ’ s original “ identity shift effect ” hypothesis , the peer pressure process works in the following way : one ’ s state of harmony is disrupted when faced with the threat of external conflict ( social rejection ) for failing to conform to a group standard thus , one conforms to the group standard , but as soon as one does , eliminating this external conflict , internal conflict is introduced ( because one has violated one ’ s own standards ) to rid oneself of this internal conflict ( self-rejection ) , an “ identity shift ” is undertaken , where one adopts the group ’ s standards as one ’ s own , thereby eliminating internal conflict ( in addition to the formerly eliminated external conflict ) , returning one to a state of harmony the way others portray themselves on social media might lead to young people trying to mimic those qualities or actions in an attempt at conformity it may also lead to a fear of missing out , which can pressure youth into irresponsible actions or decisions actions and influence on social media may lead to changes in identity , confidence , or habits in real life for children , adolescents , and adults peer pressure can , of course , operate on isolated individuals , or small groups , but it depends upon the majority wanting to do it when looking at a sample community of 3426 in the village of tare during the genocide , mcdoom found that neighborhoods and familial structures as important micro-spaces that helped determine if an individual would participate in violence the final treatment emphasized peer pressure within a neighborhood ; neighbors could view each other 's voting habits with the lists , and so the social norm of '' voting is best for the community '' is combined with the fear that individuals ' peers would judge their lack of voting this leads to a dilemma : charities will do better by approaching groups of people ( such as friends ) ; however , this could result in increased donor discomfort , which would impact their future donations
