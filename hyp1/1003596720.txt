therefore , vlf transmissions are very stable and reliable , and are used for long distance communication so practical transmitting antennas are electrical length , a small fraction of the length at which they would be self-resonant very high power transmitters ( ~1 & nbsp ; megawatt ) are required for long distance communication , so the efficiency of the antenna is an important factor due to the low radiation resistance , to minimize power dissipated in the ground these antennas require extremely low resistance ground ( earthing ) systems , consisting of radial networks of buried copper wires under the antenna at vlf the design of this coil is challenging ; it must have low resistance at the operating rf frequency , high , and must withstand the high voltage on the antenna end the large vlf antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only 50-100 & nbsp ; hertz , and when transmitting frequency shift keying ( fsk ) , the usual mode , the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation , between the two fsk frequencies large vlf antennas usually operate in 'voltage limited ' mode : the maximum power of the transmitter is limited by the voltage the antenna can accept without air breakdown , corona , and arcing from the antenna the bandwidth of large capacitively loaded vlf antennas is so narrow ( 50–100 & nbsp ; hz ) that even the small frequency shifts of fsk and msk modulation may exceed it , throwing the antenna out of resonance , causing the antenna to reflect some power back down the feedline a recent alternative used in some military vlf transmitters is a circuit which dynamically shifts the antenna 's resonant frequency between the two output frequencies with the modulation so small inefficient receiving antennas can be used , and the low voltage signal from the antenna can simply be amplified by the receiver without introducing significant noise because of the small bandwidth of the band , and the extremely narrow bandwidth of the antennas used , it is impractical to transmit audio signals ( am or fm radiotelephony ) more significantly , it would be difficult to transmit any distance because it would require an antenna with 100 times the bandwidth of current vlf antennas , which due to the chu-harrington limit would be enormous in size a small frequency shift of 30-50 & nbsp ; hertz is used due to the small bandwidth of the antenna the of large vlf antennas is typically over 200 ; this means the antenna stores far more energy ( 200 & nbsp ; times as much ) than is supplied or radiated in any single cycle of the transmitter current vlf antennas typically operate '' voltage-limited '' , with the voltage on the antenna close to the limit that the insulation will stand , so they will not tolerate any abrupt change in the voltage or current from the transmitter without arcing or other insulation problems ; minimum-shift keying ( msk ) : a continuous phase version of fsk designed specifically for small bandwidths , this was adopted by naval vlf stations in the 1970s to increase the data rate and is now the standard mode used in military vlf transmitters if the two frequencies representing ' 1 ' and ' 0 ' are 50 & nbsp ; hz apart , the standard frequency shift used in military vlf stations , their phases coincide every 20 & nbsp ; ms early attempts were made to use radiotelephone using amplitude modulation and single-sideband modulation within the band starting from 20 & nbsp ; khz , but the result was unsatisfactory because the available bandwidth was insufficient to contain the sidebands in the 1920s the discovery of the skywave ( skip ) radio propagation method allowed lower power transmitters operating at high frequency to communicate at similar distances by reflecting their radio waves off a layer of ionized atoms in the ionosphere , and long distance radio communication stations switched to the shortwave frequencies due to its long propagation distances and stable phase characteristics , during the 20th & nbsp ; century the vlf band was used for long range hyperbolic radio navigation systems which allowed ships and aircraft to determine their geographical position by comparing the phase of radio waves received from fixed vlf navigation beacon transmitters vlf was also used for standard time and frequency broadcasts submarines receive signals from land based and aircraft transmitters using some form of towed antenna that floats just under the surface of the water – for example a buoyant cable array antenna ( bcaa ) modern receivers use sophisticated digital signal processing techniques to remove the effects of atmospheric noise ( largely caused by lightning strikes around the world ) and adjacent channel signals , extending the useful reception range vlf can also penetrate soil and rock for some distance , so these frequencies are also used for through-the-earth mine communications systems transmissions typically last from one hour up to several days and both receiver and transmitter must have their frequency locked to a stable reference such as a gps disciplined oscillator or a rubidium standard in order to support such long duration coherent detection and decoding extensive digital signal processing is required to retrieve the weak signals from beneath interference from power line harmonics and radio atmospheric these spectrograms show many signals , which may include vlf transmitters and the horizontal electron beam deflection of tv sets
