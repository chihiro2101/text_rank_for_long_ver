the olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city 's application to the international olympic committee ( ioc ) by its national olympic committee ( noc ) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the ioc during an ordinary session the ioc session in which a host city is elected takes place in a country that did not submit an application to stage the olympics members from countries that have a city taking part in the election can not vote while the city is in the running following the announcement of the host city , the successful bid delegation signs the '' host city contract '' with the ioc , which delegates the responsibilities of the games organisation to the city and respective noc '' since the ioc expressly forbids any international promotion of bids before the final candidature phase , it wrote to leading british officials asking for an explanation concerning the alleged violation the chairmen of the commonwealth games federation and the british olympic association , and spokesmen from downing street and london 2012 denied any violation of the ioc 's ethical code , insisting that blair 's comments were taken out of context as there was no intention to promote the bid the report unveiled how some olympic agents could guarantee votes from certain ioc members to the london bid , in exchange for favours or money slavkov stated he was open to negotiation since he had not made up his mind about which 2012 candidate city would get his vote even though the panorama reporters clearly stated that the london bid was nowhere associated with the investigation , the bid officials made further statements claiming the team had no knowledge and involvement , hoping to distance themselves from the scandal : '' what i have to make clear is that london 2012 knew nothing about thisâ€”we have nothing to hide , '' said alan pascoe , a london 2012 vice chairman , committing to '' do everything we can to co-operate with the ioc enquiry and take this story off the running order '' immediately after announcing the initiative , london withdrew it , most likely as a result of jacques rogge raising concerns over its potential to start a '' bidding war '' the paris bid team considered submitting a complaint against london bid consultants jim sloman and rod sheard after they stated that the stade de france was not adequate for athletics , an action that goes against the ioc rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid the london team promptly denied that the two men were under contract with the bid at that time , and underlined that their opinions did not reflect the views of the london bid '' this statement was confirmed by the ioc voting numbers , which demonstrate that , even if nikolaou had voted for madrid , the city would have failed to beat paris in the third voting round then-french president jacques chirac became the subject of controversy the day before the international olympic committee was due to pick a host city not only were chirac 's comments considered unsportsmanlike where the normal etiquette is not to criticize rival cities , there were two ioc members from finland who would vote in the final ballot besides the initial nine applicant cities , other cities also wished to bid for the 2012 summer olympics , but the bids were not internally selected by the noc ( in case of more than one bidding city from the same country ) , were not put forward to the ioc , or were withdrawn before filing the necessary paperwork the nigerian capital , abuja , planned to present a bid to become the first african city to stage the olympic games , but ended up not filling its application several european cities wanted to follow the likes of london , madrid , moscow and paris , and were thus hopeful to gain their noc 's support
