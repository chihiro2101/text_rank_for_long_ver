the idea of using a three-dimensional color solid to represent all colors was developed during the 18th and 19th centuries 20–21 albert munsell , an artist and professor of art at the massachusetts normal art school ( now massachusetts college of art and design , or massart ) , wanted to create a '' rational way to describe color '' that would use decimal notation instead of color names ( which he felt were '' foolish '' and '' misleading '' ) , , ch.1 , pg these were improved significantly in the 1929 munsell book of color and through an extensive series of experiments carried out by the optical society of america in the 1940s resulting in the notations ( sample definitions ) for the modern munsell book of color though several replacements for the munsell system have been invented , building on munsell 's foundational ideas—including the optical society of america 's osa-ucs , and the international commission on illumination ’ s cielab ( l a b ) and ciecam02 color models—the munsell system is still widely used , by , among others , ansi to define skin and hair colors for forensic pathology , the usgs for matching soil colors , in prosthodontics during the selection of shades for dental restorations , and brewery for matching beer colors beer color is measured in degrees lovibond , a metric based on the munsell system the original munsell color chart remains useful for comparing computer models of human color vision one of the first books about the munsell color system , explaining the intuition behind its three dimensions , and suggesting possible uses of the system in picking color combinations an edited version can be found at a description of color systems leading up to munsell 's , and a biographical explanation of munsell 's changing ideas about color and development of his color solid , leading up to the publication of a color notation in 1905 a concise introduction to the munsell color system , on a web page which also discusses several other color systems , putting the munsell system in its historical context a color notation was published before he had established the irregular shape of a perceptual color solid , so it describes colors positioned in a sphere munsell renotation data in plain text format ( from the 1940s optical society of america renotations ) applepainter.com , a site explaining the munsell color chart , including an edited version of cleland 's book , a practical description of the munsell color system
