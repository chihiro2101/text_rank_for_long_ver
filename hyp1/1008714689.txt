bentham applied his brother 's ideas on the constant observation of workers to prisons bentham tried to put his duty and interest junction principle into practice by encouraging a public debate on prisons the apparently constant surveillance of the prison inmates by the panopticon manager and the occasional observation of the manager by the general public was to solve the age old philosophic question : '' who guards the guards ? '' bentham continued to develop the panopticon concept , as industrialisation advanced in england and an increasing number of workers were required to work in ever larger factories despite the fact that no panopticon was built during bentham 's lifetime , the principles he established on the panopticon prompted considerable discussion and debate he argued that discipline had replaced the pre-modern society of kings , and that the panopticon should not be understood as a building , but as a mechanism of power and a diagram of political technology foucault argued that discipline had crossed the technological threshold already in the late 18th century , when the right to observe and accumulate knowledge had been extended from the prison to hospitals , schools , and later factories the modern prison in the 1970s , with its corrective technology , was rooted in the changing legal powers of the state in the electronic eye : the rise of surveillance society ( 1994 ) the sociologist david lyon concluded that '' no single metaphor or model is adequate to the task of summing up what is central to contemporary surveillance , but important clues are available in nineteen eighty-four and in bentham 's panopticon '' information circulates in the control society , just like products in the modern economy , and meaningful objects of surveillance are sought out as forward-looking profiles and simulated pictures of future demands , needs and risks are drawn up in 1997 thomas mathiesen in turn expanded on foucault 's use of the panopticon metaphor when analysing the effects of mass media on society mass media has thus turned the discipline society into a viewer society in their 2004 book welcome to the machine : science , surveillance , and the culture of control , derrick jensen and george draffan called bentham '' one of the pioneers of modern surveillance '' and argued that his panopticon prison design serves as the model for modern supermax prisons , such as pelican bay state prison in california shoshana zuboff used the metaphor of the panopticon in her 1988 book in the age of the smart machine : the future of work and power to describe how computer technology makes work more visible the hawthorne effect ( 1924â€“1933 ) and a significant number of subsequent empirical studies led to the reinterpretation of alienation : instead of being a given power relationship between the worker and management , it came to be seen as hindering progress and modernity in entrapped by the electronic panopticon ? worker resistance in the call centre ( 2000 ) , phil taylor and peter bain argue that the large number of people employed in call centres undertake predictable and monotonous work that is badly paid and offers few prospects the panopticon has become a symbol of the extreme measures that some companies take in the name of efficiency as well as to guard against employee theft time-theft by workers has become accepted as an output restriction and theft has been associated by management with all behaviour that include avoidance of work in a 2009 paper by max haiven and scott stoneman entitled walmart : the panopticon of time and the 2014 book by simon head mindless : why smarter machines are making dumber humans , which describes conditions at an amazon depot in augsburg , it is argued that catering at all times to the desires of the customer can lead to increasingly oppressive corporate environments and quotas in which many warehouse workers can no longer keep up with demands of management the concept of panopticon has been referenced in early discussions about the impact of social media because the controlled is at the center and surrounded by those who watch , early surveillance studies treat social media as a reverse panopticon in modern academic literature on social media , terms like lateral surveillance , social searching , and social surveillance are employed to critically evaluate the effects of social media however , a competitive entertainment industry emerged in london and despite the varying music , the large fountains , interesting experiments and opportunities for shopping , two years after opening the amateur science panopticon project closed zamyatin goes beyond a concept of a single prison and projects panopticon principles to the whole society where people live in buildings with fully transparent walls in the 2011 tv series , person of interest , foucault 's panopticon is used to grasp the pressure under which the character harold finch suffers in the post-9/11 united states of america .
