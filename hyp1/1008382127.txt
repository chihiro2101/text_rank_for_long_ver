throughout its existence , the national command ( the body responsible for all-arab affairs ) , gave most attention to syrian affairs the congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the arab socialist movement and the ba'ath party , which took place in 1952 the syrian regional branch rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s ; in the 1954 parliamentary elections the syrian regional branch won 22 seats in parliament , becoming the second largest party in the country the failure of the traditional parties represented by the people 's party and the national party , strengthened the ba'ath party 's public credibility in light of these criticisms , the ba'ath convened the 3rd national congress ( held 27 august – 1 september 1959 ) , which was attended by delegates from '' iraq , lebanon , jordan , south arabia , the gulf , arab south , arab maghreb , palestine and party student organisations in arab and other universities outside the arab homeland '' rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party , the arab socialist revolutionary ba'ath party , which established a rival national command to compete with the original the 4th national congress , held in august 1960 , criticized the leadership of aflaq and bitar , called for the reestablishment of the syrian regional branch and deemphasized the party 's commitment to arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party he was supported in his ideological reorientation by hammud al-shufi , the regional secretary of the syrian regional branch , yasin al-hafiz , one of the party ’ s few ideological theorists , and by certain members of the secret military committee the marxist-wing gained new ground at the 6th national congress ( held in october 1963 ) , in which the iraqi and syrian regional branches called for the establishment of '' socialist planning '' , '' collective farms run by peasants '' , '' workers ' democratic control of the means of production '' , and other demands reflecting a certain emulation of soviet-style socialism aflaq , angry at this transformation of his party , retained a nominal leadership role , but the national command as a whole came under the control of the radicals in 1963 the ba'ath party seized power , from then on the ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized syrian political party , but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions however , both in iraq and syria , the regional command became the real centre of party power , and the membership of the national command became a largely honorary position , often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership in ba'athist jargon '' nation '' means the arab nation , because of that , the national command formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the ba'ath movement throughout the arab world the term region reflected the party 's refusal to acknowledge them as separate nation-states the regional congress , which combined all the provincial branches , was the region 's highest authority and elected a regional command , the party leadership in a specific region , the regional tribunal , the body responsible for discipline inspection , and a regional secretary , the regional party leader the military organization was made up of branches similar to those in the ba'ath 's civilian sector however , unlike the civilian sector the military organization was controlled by a separate military bureau , and held periodical military congresses an active member had to attend all formal meetings of his party unit , was given the right to vote in party elections , and could run for party office according to middle east expert tabitha petran , the basic idea of the party 's ideology was ; that the arab nation is a permanent entity in history to take an example , in one instance aflaq states '' the national struggle issues such as these would only gain prominence when akram al-hawrani became a leading party figure , and when the '' transitional ba'athists '' took power the '' transitional ba'ath '' , which grew out of the dissolution of the syrian regional branch in 1958 dissolution and the military committee , were more rural in outlook , policy and ideology aflaq believed that the ba'ath party , at least in theory , would rule , and guide the people , in a transitional period of time without consulting the people , however he did support intra-party democracy when the union with egypt collapsed , the ba'ath party was put in a difficult position , the party still sought arab unity , but did not oppose the uar 's dissolution and did not want to seek another union with egypt under gamal abdel nasser 's rule however , being the unionist party that it was , the party 's leaders could not state their position on this issue the third group , led by people disenchanted with both nasser and the union period , remained in the ba'ath party , stopped believing in the feasibility of pan-arabism many rank-and-file members opposed this change in policy , with many members being both disenchanted with pan-arabism and aflaq 's continued party rule the provincial party members had not been told of the syrian regional branch 's dissolution , which in fact broke the communication line with provincial branches and the national command hammud al-shufi became the leader of the party 's marxist faction during his short stint as syrian regional secretary , literally the head of the syrian regional organization shufi was able , due to his position as head of the organization bureau of the regional command , to recruit several marxist or marxist-leaning members to the top of the syrian regional party hierarchy radical socialists led by ali salih al-sadi took control of the iraqi regional branch in 1963 , which led to the official radicalization of the party 's ideology the document , which was approved by the 6th national congress , relegated arab unity to a secondary role and gave socialism prominence neo-ba'athism is the dramatic changes that manifested in ba'athist ideology from 1960 to 1964 , and the military committee 's takeover of the syrian regional branch and the national command in the period 1964 to 1966 the 6th national congress signified the takeover of the party by an anti-militarist left , which opposed both the traditional leaders in the national command and the pragmatists in the military committee when the anti-military left called for popular democracy , no involvement of the military in national politics and popular struggle , the military committee became concerned '' in collaboration with the national command the military committee succeeded in expelling the anti-military left from the party at the 7th national congress the military committee , which now controlled the syrian regional branch , took control of the ba'ath party in the coup of 1966 at the time of 14 july revolution in 1958 , which overthrew the kingdom of iraq , the regional branch had 300 members the iraqi regional branch supported abd al-karim qasim 's rule on the grounds that he would seek iraq 's entry into the united arab republic after taking power , the regional branch through its militia , the national guard , initiated what iraqi expert con coughlin referred to as an '' orgy of violence '' against communism and left-wing elements these repressive measures coupled with factionalism within the regional branch led to the november 1963 iraqi coup d'état by president arif and his nasserite supporters following the party 's establishment in syria , ba'athist ideas spread throughout the arab world despite the ideology being very popular , it took time before the actual regional branch was established on his return from exile he tried to persuade the regional branch to join in an electoral front with the jordanian communist party however , the regional branch leaders rimawi , na'was , gharbiyah and munif al-razzaz opposed such an idea , and because of it , shuqyar left the ba'ath party however , a persistent problem for him during his election campaign was the vocal criticism of him and the regional branch by the lebanese communist party a resolution was approved , which stated that the party leaders [ aflaq , al-bitar among others had to hastily entered into a union with egypt , had wrongly dissolved the syrian regional branch in 1958 , given pan-arabism primacy when socialism was the more important , the need to use marxist , not ba'athi , tools to analyze the current situation and the need for the party to strengthen their positions amongst the popular classes–the workers , peasants , artisans and shopkeepers because of the position of the lebanese regional branch , aflaq at the 5th national congress invited enough iraqi regional branch delegates to neutralize the lebanese delegates however , at the same time , the lebanese regional branch opposed hawrani and his faction at the 7th national congress the national command in collaboration with the military committee either expelled or removed leftists such as those found in the lebanese regional branch from leadership position , and in the most severe cases , expelled them from the party the ba'athist were accused of working to overthrow '' the political , economic and social system '' of the kingdom ; the sentences ranged from everything to eight months to two years by the end of 1957 , the scp was able to weaken the ba'ath party to such an extent that the ba'ath party drafted a bill in december that called for a union with egypt , a move that proved to be very popular following the success of the ramadan revolution , led by the ba'ath party 's iraqi regional branch , the military committee hastily convened to hatch a coup against nazim al-kudsi 's presidency the military committee , which was itself a tiny minority of the already small ba'ath party membership , was forced to rule by force the ba'ath party had only 2,500 members by mid-1963 , the party lacked a popular base
