it was essentially a condensed church service on the air , with hymn singing featured along with armstrong 's message , and it was the launching point for what would become the radio church of god although his views were rejected by the local congregation , he gained a growing following of his own , chiefly through his world tomorrow broadcasts and the plain truth magazine to facilitate the work of the growing church , he incorporated it on march 3 , 1946 , as the radio church of god in 1971 armstrong criticized teachings that christ would return in 1975 and that the church should flee to a '' place of safety '' in 1972 , as no man knew the time of christ 's return ( matthew 24:36 and 25:13 ) armstrong wrote that 1975 could not possibly be the year of christ 's return because of his strong emphasis on these prophetic dates , the church grew quickly in the late 1960s and , on january 5 , 1968 , was renamed the worldwide church of god while church members were told at the time that the reason was ted armstrong 's opposition to some of his father 's teachings , ted armstrong later admitted that the actual reason was his relationships with many women any such disfellowshipments were announced at services , so the congregation as a whole became aware every month herbert armstrong would write and mail out a 'co-worker ' letter to members and non-members supportive of the work of the church , through their donations others followed , including john kerley 's top of the line ministry in 1978 ; the restoration church of god ; the church of god ( boise city ) in boise city , oklahoma ; marvin faulhaber 's sabbatarian , a group also known as church of god ( sabbatarian ) ; and the fountain of life fellowship of james and virginia porter these factions survived well past herbert armstrong 's death in 1986 , most retaining the name church of god because armstrong had pointed out that this is the name god calls his church in the bible armstrong did end up meeting with many world leaders to whom he would , appropriately , present expensive gifts , then preached to them simplistically , how that there were '' two ways '' of life , – one , of giving and the other - the way of getting during the 1960s , '' armstrong had sought to put into stronger action what he later termed god ’ s way of give '' 25-26 nevertheless , ticket sales could still not pay for the appearances of world-renowned performers , so armstrong used church tithe money to subsidize these performances without informing his congregation of how '' god 's holy tithe '' was being spent thus , the church began to cut back on its funding most were unaware that herbert armstrong had been preaching about revelation and bible prophecy on the radio as far back as world war ii after the war ended , armstrong attended a meeting in san francisco in which a proposal was made to create the united nations because church literature such as the wonderful world tomorrow , 1975 in prophecy ! , and many others had attempted to pinpoint the date of christ 's return , members continued to wait anxiously for the second coming garner ted spoke of greatly expanding the church 's media ministry on the model of the church of christ , scientist with its widely read christian science monitor to which herbert w rader characterized his involvement as that of an adviser and claimed that his advice was opening doors for armstrong that a strict theological role would not have allowed for herbert armstrong claimed that he did not approve of the establishment of the aicf , which rader set up ostensibly to give the elder armstrong a role as the '' ambassador for world peace without portfolio '' garner ted moved to tyler , texas , and there founded a splinter group , the church of god international several members in good standing with the worldwide church of god at the time prompted the state of california to investigate charges of malfeasance by rader and herbert w the matter gained the attention of mike wallace who investigated the church in a report for 60 minutes wayne cole , who was made temporary acting head of the church by herbert armstrong , that rader was attempting to take over the church after armstrong 's death , reasoning that the donated tithe money was the incentive and quite a '' magnet '' to stan rader while remaining a member , he left the public spotlight as an attorney , retired , but continued to receive payments from the worldwide church of god on his lifetime contract , 300,000 per year , until his death from acute pancreatic cancer on july 2 , 2002 directed the church theology towards mainstream evangelical christian belief , mostly against the wishes of his congregations , but they were given no input because he had maintained the same structure as herbert armstrong eventually all of herbert armstrong 's writings were withdrawn from print by the worldwide church of god though they are still made available by other denominations this decision was reached after several years of study after armstrong 's death , the church 's new leadership began a process of theological revision in order to gain acceptance by the evangelical alliance armstrong held the belief that these countries played a central role in the end times that were about to begin armstrong contended that god was not a closed trinity but was instead building a family through the holy spirit , which armstrong considered to be god 's powerful unifying essence guiding and bringing to remembrance those things which christ taught armstrong also taught that members of the church would actually become members of the god family themselves after the resurrection in fact , these practices are still observed in several of the church 's remaining branches today at that point , however , the leaders of the wcg decided to drop the case and give over not only mystery of the ages , but also several other works originally written by armstrong critics also contended that the wcg did not proclaim salvation by grace through faith alone , but rather required works as part of salvation armstrong contended that all church doctrine could be proven simply and effectively through the bible , and that one did not need to '' accept on faith '' any of the worldwide church of god 's doctrinal beliefs this and the president 's power to appoint and remove members of the advisory council have remained areas of concern even among those who applaud the church 's doctrinal changes some senior pastors are responsible for a single local church , but many are responsible for working in two or more churches the early worldwide church of god used a three-tithe system , under which members were expected to give a tithe or ten percent '' of their increase '' , usually interpreted as a family 's income the first tithe , 10 percent of a member 's total income , was sent to church headquarters to finance '' the work '' , which was all operations of the church , as well as broadcasting and publishing the church 's message unlike the first tithe , these funds were not sent into the church but retained by the member in contrast to many other churches ' religious services , the practice of the wcg was not to pass around offering plates during weekly church services but only during holy day church services ( seven days each year ) the church also gathered funds in the form of donations from '' co-workers , '' those who read the church 's free literature or watched the weekly tv show but did not actually attend services the journal : news of the churches of god , january 31 , 2013 most teach that they are the continuation of the wcg and many have also rewritten armstrong 's books and booklets grace communion international statement of
