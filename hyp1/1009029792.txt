the history of level crossings depends on the location , but often early level crossings had a flagman in a nearby booth who would , on the approach of a train , wave a red flag or lantern to stop all traffic and clear the tracks in rural regions with sparse traffic , the least expensive type of level crossing to operate is one without flagmen or gates , with only a warning sign posted article 27 suggests stop lines at level crossings with rare exceptions , trains do not stop at level crossings and rely on vehicles and pedestrians to clear the tracks in advance today , active protection is widely available , and fewer collisions take place at level crossings with active warning systems where third rail systems have level crossings , there is a gap in the third rail over the level crossing , but this does not necessarily interrupt the power supply to trains since they may have current collectors on multiple cars traffic signal-controlled intersections next to level crossings on at least one of the roads in the intersection usually feature traffic signal preemption section 4d.13 and section 8d.07 of the manual on uniform traffic control devices approaching trains activate a routine where , before the train signals and gates are activated , all traffic signal phases go to red , except for the signal immediately after the train crossing , which turns green ( or flashing yellow ) to allow traffic on the tracks to clear ( in some cases , there are auxiliary traffic signals prior to the railroad crossing which will turn red , keeping new traffic from crossing the tracks still in other areas , the traffic parallel to the railroad track will have a green light for the duration of the train while the other directions face a red light for the duration of the train further still in other areas can traffic lights operate relatively normally with only the blocked direction turning red for the duration of the train , while not having an actual runway crossing , had extra low signals and telegraph wires at the railway station to improve safety for low flying aircraft landing or taking off at-grade intersection at-grade railway automatic full barriers billups neon crossing signal boom barrier : category : level crossing accidents four-quadrant gate grade crossing signals grade separation lists of rail accidents : list of train accidents by death toll list of road accidents pedestrian crossing warning sign whistle post wigwag occupation crossing
