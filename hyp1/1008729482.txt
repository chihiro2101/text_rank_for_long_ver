bougainville , tasked with the defence of the large area between cap diamant and cap rouge , was upstream with his troops at cap rouge on the night of 12 september , and missed seeing numerous british ships moving downstream a camp of approximately 100 militia led by captain louis du pont duchambon de vergor , who had unsuccessfully faced the british four years previously at fort beauséjour , had been assigned to watch the narrow road at l'anse-au-foulon which followed a streambank , the coulée saint-denis vaudreuil and others had expressed their concern at the possibility of l'anse-au-foulon being vulnerable , but montcalm dismissed them , saying 100 men would hold off the army until daylight , remarking , '' it is not to be supposed that the enemies have wings so that they can in the same night cross the river , disembark , climb the obstructed acclivity , and scale the walls , for which last operation they would have to carry ladders a group of 24 volunteers led by colonel william howe with fixed bayonets were sent to clear the picket along the road , and climbed the slope , a maneuver that allowed them to come up behind vergor 's camp and capture it quickly left the plateau was undefended save for vergor 's camp , as vaudreuil had ordered one of the french regiments to relocate to the east of the city not long before the landing . though he might have awaited reinforcement by bougainville 's column ( allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the british position ) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces , or even yielded the city to wolfe , he instead elected to confront wolfe 's force directly . to an artillery officer named montbelliard , montcalm explained his decision thus : '' we can not avoid action ; the enemy is entrenching , he already has two pieces of cannon while the regular french forces were approaching from beauport and quebec , the canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the british left flank , sheltering in the trees and scrub ; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat , eventually holding the bridge over the st in order to cover the entire plain , wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep , rather than the more conventional three ranks the defenders pushed the british from one house , but were repelled and , in retreat , lit several houses on fire to keep them out of enemy hands watercolour by charles william jefferys ( 1869–1951 ) as french troops arrived from beauport , montcalm , one of few mounted men on the field , decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the british from their position as the french approached , the british lines held their fire wolfe had devised a firing method for stopping french column advances in 1755 that called for the centre—in this case , the 43rd and 47th foot regiments—to hold fire while waiting for the advancing force to approach within , then open fire at close range the french held their fire and both armies waited for two or three minutes . captain john knox , serving with the 43rd foot , wrote in his journal that as the french came within range , the regiments '' gave them , with great calmness , as remarkable a close and heavy discharge as i ever saw '' after the first volley , the british lines marched forward a few paces towards the shocked french force and fired a second general volley that shattered the attackers and sent them into retreat volunteer james henderson , with the louisbourg grenadiers , had been tasked with holding the hill , and reported afterwards that within moments of the command to fire , wolfe was struck with two shots , one low in the stomach and the second , a mortal wound in the chest . with wolfe dead and several other key officers injured , british troops fell into a disorganised pursuit of the retreating french troops the 78th fraser highlanders were ordered by brigadier-general james murray to pursue the french with their swords , but were met near the city by a heavy fire from a floating battery covering the bridge over the st when the highlanders were gathered together , they lay 'd on a separate attack against a large body of canadians on our flank that were posted in a small village and a bush of woods 186 townshend took charge of the british forces and realised that bougainville 's column was approaching from the british rear , having taken some time to arrive from cap rouge he quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet the oncoming french , a day-saving manoeuvre ; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force , bougainville retreated while the rest of montcalm 's army slipped back across the st the french had defeated the british , but the british were able to withdraw within the walls of quebec , to which the french laid siege a lack of artillery and ammunition , combined with british improvements to the fortifications , meant that the french were unable to take the city by storm
