here he studied for a time under ernst bengel , grandson of the eminent new testament critic , johann albrecht bengel , and at this early stage in his career he seems to have been under the influence of the old tübingen school when , a few years after his appointment at blaubeuren , he published his first important work , symbolik und mythologie oder die naturreligion des altertums ( '' symbol and mythology : the natural religion of antiquity '' , 1824–1825 ) , it became evident that he had made a deeper study of philosophy , and had come under the influence of schelling and more particularly of friedrich schleiermacher it was assumed that this 4th century opinion represented the christianity of the twelve apostles ; paulinism was originally a heresy , and a schism from the jewish christianity of james and peter and the rest ; marcion was a leader of the pauline sect in its survival in the 2nd century , using only the pauline gospel , st the clementine literature had its first origin in the apostolic age , and belonged to the original jewish , petrine , legal church catholicism under the presidency of rome was the result of the adjustment between the petrine and pauline sections of the church in the second half of the 2nd century the fourth gospel is a monument of this reconciliation , in which rome took a leading part , having invented the fiction that both peter and paul were the founders of her church , both having been martyred at rome , and on the same day , in perfect union throughout the middle of the 19th century this theory , in many forms , was dominant in germany the demonstration , mainly by english scholars , of the impossibility of the late dates ascribed to the new testament documents ( four epistles of st baur placed the completed form , ‘ ‘ h ’ ’ , soon after the middle of the 2nd century , and schliemann ( 1844 ) agreed , placing ‘ ‘ r ’ ’ , as a revision , between 211 and 230 '' the change of view is illustrated clearly in the essay , published in the tübinger zeitschrift for 1831 , on the christ-party in the apollos , die christuspartei in der korinthischen gemeinde , der gegensatz des paulinischen und petrinischen christentums in der ältesten kirche , der apostel petrus in rom , the trend of which is suggested by the title ( in english , 'the christ party in the corinthian community , the opposition of pauline and petrine christianity in the earliest church , the apostle peter in rome ' ) in this baur attempts to prove that the false teachers mentioned in the second epistle to timothy and epistle to titus are the gnostics , particularly the marcionites , of the 2nd century , and consequently that the pastoral epistles were produced in the middle of the 2nd century in opposition to gnosticism baur was prepared to apply his theory to the whole of the new testament ; in the words of h the petrine matthew bears the closest relationship to this original gospel ( urevangelium ) ; the pauline luke is later and arose independently ; mark represents a still later development according to baur ; the account in john is idealistic : it '' does not possess historical truth , and can not and does not really lay claim to it '' baur 's theory starts with the supposition that christianity was gradually developed out of judaism , see also list of events in early christianity thus there was some antagonism between the jewish apostles peter , james and john , and paul the '' apostle to the gentiles '' , and this struggle continued down to the middle of the 2nd century in short , the conflict between petrinism and paulinism is , as karl schwarz puts it , the key to the literature of the 1st and 2nd century the kirchengeschichte was published in five volumes during the years 1853-1863 , partly by baur himself , partly by his son , ferdinand baur , and his son-in-law , eduard zeller , from notes and lectures which the author left behind him the tübingen school was at the height of its influence in the 1840s , but lost ground to later historical analysis paul , the apostle of jesus christ , his life and work , his epistles and his doctrine translated by eduard zeller church history of the first three centuries vol 1 1878 english translation church history of the first three centuries vol 2 english a philological introduction to greek and latin for students translated by paul kegen 1879 f.c
