major developments and innovations include : norfolk four-course crop rotation : fodder crops , particularly turnips and clover , replaced leaving the land fallow enclosure : the removal of common rights to establish exclusive ownership of land development of a national market free of tariffs , tolls and customs barriers transportation infrastructures , such as improved roads , canals , and later , railways land conversion , land drains and reclamation increase in farm size selective breeding one of the most important innovations of the british agricultural revolution was the development of the norfolk four-course rotation , which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow the norfolk system , as it is now known , rotates crops so that different crops are planted with the result that different kinds and quantities of nutrients are taken from the soil as the plants grow an important feature of the norfolk four-field system was that it used labour at times when demand was not at peak levels during the middle ages , the open field system had initially used a two-field crop rotation system where one field was left fallow or turned into pasture for a time to try to recover some of its plant nutrients the farmers in flanders ( in parts of france and current day belgium ) discovered a still more effective four-field crop rotation system , using turnips and clover ( a legume ) as forage crops to replace the three-year crop rotation fallow year guano and nitrates from south america were introduced in the mid-19th century and fallow steadily declined to reach only about 4 % in 1900 this maintains a good amount of crops produced in the traditional open field system , many subsistence farmers cropped strips of land in large fields held in common and divided the produce as early as the 12th century , some fields in england tilled under the open field system were enclosed into individually owned fields more secure control of the land allowed the owners to make innovations that improved their yields the more productive enclosed farms meant that fewer farmers were needed to work the same land , leaving many villagers without land and grazing rights some practices of enclosure were denounced by the church , and legislation was drawn up against it ; but the large , enclosed fields were needed for the gains in agricultural productivity from the 16th to 18th centuries by the 19th century , marketing was nationwide and the vast majority of agricultural production was for market rather than for the farmer and his family eventually , the market evolved into a national one driven by london and other growing cities water transport was , and in some cases still is , much more efficient than land transport railroads would eventually reduce the cost of land transport by over 95 % ; however they did not become important until after 1850 due to the large and dense population of flanders and holland , farmers there were forced to take maximum advantage of every bit of usable land ; the country had become a pioneer in canal building , soil restoration and maintenance , soil drainage , and land reclamation technology with the development of regional markets and eventually a national market , aided by improved transportation infrastructures , farmers were no longer dependent on their local market and were less subject to having to sell at low prices into an oversupplied local market and not being able to sell their surpluses to distant localities that were experiencing shortages farming became a business rather than solely a means of subsistence to be successful , farmers had to become effective managers who incorporated the latest farming innovations in order to be low cost producers in england , robert bakewell and thomas coke introduced selective breeding as a scientific practice , mating together two animals with particularly desirable characteristics , and also using inbreeding or the mating of close relatives , such as father and daughter , or brother and sister , to stabilise certain qualities in order to reduce genetic diversity in desirable animal programmes from the mid-18th century using native stock , he was able to quickly select for large , yet fine-boned sheep , with long , lustrous wool as more and more farmers followed his lead , farm animals increased dramatically in size and quality significant imports of potash obtained from the ashes of trees burned in opening new agricultural lands were imported in addition to land for cultivation there was also a demand for pasture land to support more livestock the recovery of food imports after the napoleonic wars ( 1803–1815 ) and the resumption of american trade following the war of 1812 ( 1812–1815 ) led to the enactment in 1815 of the corn laws ( protective tariffs ) to protect cereal grain producers in britain against foreign competition though the blight also struck scotland , wales , england , and much of continental europe , its effect there was far less severe since potatoes constituted a much smaller percentage of the diet than in ireland the poor harvests , however , masked a greater threat to british agriculture : growing imports of foodstuffs from abroad farmers with much larger and more productive farms to export hard grain to britain at a price that undercut the british farmers it hit the agricultural sector hard and was the most severe in europe and the united states , which had been experiencing strong economic growth fuelled by the second industrial revolution in the decade following the american civil war the technology to manufacture affordable and reliable machinery , including agricultural machinery , improved dramatically in the last half of the nineteenth century the agricultural revolution was part of a long process of improvement , but sound advice on farming began to appear in england in the mid-17th century , from writers such as samuel hartlib , walter blith and others , thirsk despite its name , the agricultural revolution in britain did not result in overall productivity per hectare of agricultural area as high as in china , where intensive cultivation ( including multiple annual cropping in many areas ) had been practiced for many centuries the agricultural revolution in britain proved to be a major turning point in history , allowing the population to far exceed earlier peaks and sustain the country 's rise to industrial pre-eminence towards the end of the 19th century , the substantial gains in british agricultural productivity were rapidly offset by competition from cheaper imports , made possible by the exploitation of new lands and advances in transportation , refrigeration , and other technologies '' a new perspective on medieval and early modern agriculture : six centuries of norfolk farming c “ the agricultural labour market in england , 1793-1872 '' tracking the agricultural revolution in england ''
