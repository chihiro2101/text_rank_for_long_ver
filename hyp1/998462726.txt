some researchers have considered the accountability using formal theory , which makes assumptions about the state of the world to draw larger conclusions ( link ) therefore , checking the accountability is the basis of the success of public administration research suggests that public goods provision is conditional on being able to attribute outcomes to politicians as opposed to civil servants another condition determining how voters use the provision of public goods to hold leaders accountable is whether the prioritization of public goods is determined either directly via vote or delegated to a governing body an experiment in new mexico regarding proposed spending during the state 's 2008 special summer legislative session provides evidence that legislators update their positions when learning about voters ' policy preferences , indicating representative democracy can increase accountability when politicians learn about voters ' preferences a 2016 experiment in afghanistan regarding rural development projects , however , finds that when voters directly prioritize their preferences at the ballot box , they perceive the quality of local government to be higher than when a governing committee prioritizes development projects these contrasting outcomes highlight the trustee-vs-delegate debate , though the lack of objective superior outcomes in projects decided by vote as opposed to committee in the afghanistan experiment indicate neither is superior to the other in determining which public good should be given priority other research indicates voters use elections to hold politicians accountable for the provision of public goods both of these research outcomes hinge on the context of voters being able to attribute the service of public goods to politicians , however there is further evidence suggesting higher quality of life , civil liberties , and human development in electoral autocracies , lending credence to the theory that autocratic rulers use elections as a bellwether against popular discontent and citizen opposition and in turn increase public goods provision to dampen grievances of disgruntled citizens , even in non-democracies while scholars who study democratic theory emphasize the role of elections in ensuring accountability , another strand of scholars investigates non-electoral forms of accountability in democracies and non-democracies and the conditions that make unelected leaders represent the interests of the general public one study of the tea party movement in the united states has shown that protests per se have an impact on political change one study has also shown that civil society organizations such as ngos can increase the performance of local government according to the central government 's standards by monitoring and disclosing information about local government performance in authoritarian regimes like china solidary groups – groups based on shared moral obligations and interests – in rural china , where members of the group share moral obligations and interests , can hold local officials accountable as well at the local level , various accountability measures exist that impact the job performance of elected officials in uganda , civil society organizations ( csos ) that divulge to the public how well an incumbent is performing their job duties , in a district with an upcoming competitive election , increases the performance of the politician for the rest of their term in contrast to these works , meta-analysis released in 2019 uncover no effects from cso voter information campaigns on political accountability after examining the results from seven trials across six countries in ghana , election-day monitoring of polling centers for district-level positions , as well as gaining awareness of monitoring in an upcoming election , increases job performance among incumbents as these officials spent more of their annual constituency development fund allocations from the central government on public goods for the electorate these elected officials are held accountable to their positions mainly through the information provided to the public through the media when the media focuses attention on data trends associated with these positions , constituents are then able to use this information to retrospectively vote for or against the incumbent based on the performance shown while in office approval ratings generated through public opinion polling create a measure of job performance during an incumbent 's term that has implications for whether the official will retain their seat , or if reelection will even be sought when selectorates ' hold on power is not overly dependent on the leader in office , selectorates can remove poorly performing leaders , and this accountability by selectorates render it possible for autocracies to perform better for the benefit of all many customary chiefs never leave the communities they lead permanently and depend on local sources for a significant portion of their income , thus , traditional leaders may facilitate bringing local public goods in the present and benefit from the community 's development over time just like stationary bandits in olson 's argument however , recent studies suggest that , though voters have a general distaste for corruption , they often fail to punish corrupt incumbents ; and that some of them also receive benefits from their representatives ' corrupt practices , and prefer to retain this type of politicians furthermore , so far , the only agreement in the literature is that freedom of the press contributes to the reduction of corruption , by exposing these actions nevertheless , information about corruption may not only lead to vote losses for the incumbent parties , but also for the challenger parties , as well to the erosion of partisan attachments , which implies that information about corruption also provokes citizens ' disengagement from the political process because many different individuals in large organizations contribute in many ways to the decisions and policies , it is difficult even in principle to identify who should be accountable for the results another solution , recently proposed by thompson , is to hold individuals accountable for the design of the organization , both retrospectively and prospectively '' responsibility for failures of government : the problem of many hands , '' american review of public administration 44 ( 3 ) : 259–273 with the increase over the last several decades in public service provided by private entities , especially in britain and the united states , some have called for increased political accountability mechanisms for otherwise non-political entities legal scholar anne davies , for instance , argues that the line between public institutions and private entities like corporations is becoming blurred in certain areas of public service in the united kingdom , and that this can compromise political accountability in those areas v : media and corruption better media means less corruption greater political accountability and lower corruption were more likely where newspaper consumption was higher in data from roughly 100 countries and from different states in the us when elected officials and the public gain information , the public is better equipped to hold politicians accountable and politicians are more responsive in their work , they find releasing audit reports prior to elections creates a more informed electorate which holds incumbent officials accountable while large evidence supports the positive impact of press freedom on political accountability , other work has highlighted the significance of factors such as media concentration and ownership as government tools for influencing or controlling news content control of the media may also be especially beneficial to incumbents in new or developing democracies , who consider media control a spoil of office electoral reform in the united states citizen funding of news that allow individual citizens to direct small amounts of government funds to news outlets or investigative journalism projects of their choice by preventing citizens from removing leaders through elections based on their performance in office , electoral manipulation breaks down accountability and may even undercut the consolidation of democratic institutions however , governments may engage in electoral manipulation not only to obtain victory at a given election or to remain longer in office , but also for post-election reasons such as reducing the strength of the opposition and increasing their own bargaining power in the subsequent period '' responsibility for failures
