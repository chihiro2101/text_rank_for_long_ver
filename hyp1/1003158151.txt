ed summers , a pittsburgh teammate of cicotte who adopted the pitch and helped develop it , modified it by holding the ball with his fingertips and using the thumb for balance the fingertip grip is more commonly used today by knuckleball pitchers , like retired boston red sox pitcher tim wakefield , who had a knuckleball with a lot of movement sometimes young players will throw the knuckleball with their knuckles flat against the ball , giving it less spin but also making it difficult to throw any significant distance the ball completes between one-quarter and one-half a rotation on its way from the pitcher to the batter ; the position of the stitches changes as the ball travels , affecting the drag that gives the ball its motion , thus making its flight erratic hitting a knuckleball is different enough from other aspects of baseball that players specifically prepare for the pitch during batting practice before games they expect it in ( a common phrase for hitting a knuckleball is '' if it 's low , let it go ; if it 's high , let it fly '' ; meaning that a batter should attempt to hit a knuckleball only if it crosses the plate high in the strike zone due to lack of break to reduce the chances of having the knuckleball get hit for a home run , some pitchers will impart a slight topspin so that if no force causes the ball to dance , it will move downward in flight this is due to both the knuckleball 's low average speed and its erratic movement , which force the catcher to keep focusing on the ball even after the runners start stealing their next bases however , since a typical major league starting rotation exceeds the length of a series against any one opponent , one way a manager can mitigate this disadvantage is to adjust his team 's pitching rotation so as to eliminate ( or at least minimize ) games in which a knuckleballer would pitch against teams with a preponderance of fast baserunners image : wakefield throws a knuckleball.jpg thumb right 267px tim wakefield in his throwing motion , showing his grip of the knuckleball since it developed during a period when the spitball was legal and commonly used , and was similarly surprising in its motion , the knuckleball was sometimes called the '' dry spitter '' toad ramsey , a pitcher from 1885 to 1890 , is credited in some later sources with being the first knuckleballer , apparently based primarily on accounts of how he gripped the ball ; however , based on more contemporary descriptions of his pitch as an '' immense drop ball '' , it may be that his pitch was a form of knuckle curve two later pitchers , jesse haines and freddie fitzsimmons , were sometimes characterized as knuckleball pitchers even by their contemporaries , but in their cases it again refers to a harder-thrown , curving pitch that would probably not be called a knuckleball today , only about 70 major league baseball pitchers have regularly used the knuckleball during their careers , and its use has become rarer over time the knuckleball is radically different from any other pitch in a pitcher 's arsenal , being less predictable and difficult to control pitching coaches often struggle with knuckleball pitchers due to a lack of experience with the pitch coaches have also been seen as a barrier to succeeding with the knuckleball this was common due to the amount of practice one must put into the pitch furthermore , other factors , such as a dearth of knuckleball teachers and the dramatic increase in the running game -- -base stealing is often easier against knuckleball pitchers -- -may be contributing to its demise when originally developed , the knuckleball was used by a number of pitchers as simply one pitch in their repertoire , usually as part of changing speeds from their fastball it is almost never used in a mixed repertoire today , however , and some believe that to throw the knuckleball effectively with some semblance of control over the pitch , one must throw it more or less exclusively unlike conventional pitches , which perform fast results without much exertion , a knuckleball pitcher must train his body and muscle memory to be able to execute a 65 & nbsp ; mph pitch with less than one rotation pitchers like bouton have found success as knuckleballers after their ability to throw hard declined indeed , bouton 's famous best-selling book ball four ( 1970 ) , while scandalous at the time for its unvarnished and often uncomplimentary portrayal of player behavior and coaching small-mindedness , is primarily a tale of the ups and downs of trying to hang on in the major leagues as a knuckleball pitcher as with hitters , the unpredictable motion of the knuckleball makes it one of the most difficult pitches for catchers to handle , and they tend to be charged with a significantly higher number of passed balls in association football or soccer , the method of striking the ball so that it produces almost no spinning motion during its flight has been colloquially described as '' knuckleballing '' by commentators , due to the ball 's motion that resembles a baseball thrown with a knuckleball pitch knuckleball headquarters – comprehensive collection of information about the pitch and those who have thrown it the ( mostly ) complete list of knuckleball pitchers – a list of just about everyone who 's thrown the pitch in the major leagues , with links to each player 's career stats
