however , the boundary layer would separate early , as the pressure gradient switched from favorable ( pressure decreasing in the flow direction ) to unfavorable ( pressure increasing in the flow direction ) , creating a large region of low pressure behind the ball that creates high form drag this results in higher skin friction , but it moves the point of boundary layer separation further along , resulting in lower drag these layers separate the fast moving jet from the external fluid , and at a certain critical reynolds number they become unstable and break down to turbulence the characteristic which is responsible for the enhanced mixing and increased rates of mass , momentum and energy transports in a flow is called '' diffusivity '' in fluid dynamics , they are essentially vortices subjected to stretching associated with a corresponding increase of the component of vorticity in the stretching directionâ€”due to the conservation of angular momentum on the other hand , vortex stretching is the core mechanism on which the turbulence energy cascade relies to establish and maintain identifiable structure function in general , the stretching mechanism implies thinning of the vortices in the direction perpendicular to the stretching direction due to volume conservation of fluid elements as a result , the radial length scale of the vortices decreases and the larger flow structures break down into smaller structures the process continues until the small scale structures are small enough that their kinetic energy can be transformed by the fluid 's molecular viscosity into heat on the other hand , oceanic flows are dispersive but essentially non rotational and therefore are not turbulent eventually this process creates structures that are small enough that molecular diffusion becomes important and viscous dissipation of energy finally takes place via this energy cascade , turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow turbulent flows may be viewed as made of an entire hierarchy of eddies over a wide range of length scales and the hierarchy can be described by the energy spectrum that measures the energy in flow velocity fluctuations for each length scale ( wavenumber ) the scales in the energy cascade are generally uncontrollable and highly non-symmetric ; integral time scale the integral time scale for a lagrangian flow can be defined as : : t \left ( \frac \ , , since the experimental values obtained for the second order structure function only deviate slightly from the value predicted by kolmogorov theory , the value for is very near to ( differences are about 2 % )
