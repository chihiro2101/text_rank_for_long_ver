if symptoms do appear , they usually take 4–6 weeks from the time of infection the infected individual may have what appears to be a potbelly in rare instances , the central nervous system is affected individuals with chronic active schistosomiasis may not complain of typical symptoms the first potential reaction is an itchy , papule rash that results from cercariae penetrating the skin , often in a person 's first infection a similar , more severe reaction called '' swimmer 's itch '' reaction can also be caused by cercariae from animal trematodes that often infect birds another primary condition , called katayama fever , may also develop from infection with these worms , and it can be very difficult to recognize acute schistosomiasis ( katayama fever ) may occur weeks or months after the initial infection as a systemic reaction against migrating schistosomulae as they pass through the bloodstream through the lungs to the liver bladder cancer diagnosis and mortality are generally elevated in affected areas ; efforts to control schistosomiasis in egypt have led to decreases in the bladder cancer rate the risk of bladder cancer appears to be especially high in male smokers , perhaps due to chronic irritation of the bladder lining allowing it to be exposed to carcinogens from smoking in women , genitourinary disease can also include genital lesions that may lead to increased rates of hiv transmission eggs also migrate to the liver leading to fibrosis in 4 to 8 % of people with chronic infection , mainly those with long-term heavy infection in situ egg deposition following the anomalous migration of the adult worm appears to be the only mechanism by which schistosoma can reach the central nervous system in these patients the destructive action on the nervous tissue and the mass effect produced by a large number of eggs surrounded by multiple , large granulomas in circumscribed areas of the brain characterize the pseudotumoral form of neuroschistosomiasis and are responsible for the appearance of clinical manifestations : headache , hemiparesis , altered mental status , vertigo , visual abnormalities , seizures , and ataxia for several weeks , the worm remains in the vessels , continuing its development into its adult phase if the eggs do not get excreted , they can become engrained in the body tissues and cause a variety of problems such as immune reactions and organ damage because eggs may be passed intermittently or in small numbers , their detection is enhanced by repeated examinations or concentration procedures , or both antibody detection can be useful to indicate schistosome infection in people who have traveled to areas where schistosomiasis is common and in whom eggs can not be demonstrated in fecal or urine specimens test sensitivity and specificity vary widely among the many tests reported for the serologic diagnosis of schistosomiasis and are dependent on both the type of antigen preparations used ( crude , purified , adult worm , egg , cercarial ) and the test procedure haematobium infection , and less than 50 % for s mansoni , immunoblots of the species appropriate to the patient 's travel history are also tested to ensure detection of s the presence of antibody is indicative only of schistosome infection at some time and can not be correlated with clinical status , worm burden , egg production , or prognosis the drug praziquantel is used for prevention in high-risk populations living in areas where the disease is common the centers for disease control and prevention advises avoiding drinking or coming into contact with contaminated water in areas where schistosomiasis is common japonicum infection in both humans and the intermediate host snails and reduced the infection risk by 3–4 times relative to the conventional strategy because of praziquantel 's lower cost per treatment , and oxaminiquine 's lack of efficacy against the urogenital form of the disease caused by s the treatment objective is to cure the disease and to prevent the evolution of the acute to the chronic form of the disease all cases of suspected schistosomiasis should be treated regardless of presentation because the adult parasite can live in the host for years the who has developed guidelines for community treatment based on the impact the disease has on children in villages in which it is common : when a village reports more than 50 percent of children have blood in their urine , everyone in the village receives treatment another agent , mefloquine , which has previously been used to treat and prevent malaria , was recognised in 2008–2009 to be effective against schistosoma an estimated 600 to 700 million people worldwide are at risk from the disease because they live in countries where the organism is common in 2012 , 249 million people were in need of treatment to prevent the disease this likely makes it the most common parasitic infection with malaria second and causing about 207 million cases in 2013 epidemiological evidence suggests that this campaign unintentionally contributed to the spread of hepatitis c via unclean needles egypt has the world 's highest hepatitis c infection rate , and the infection rates in various regions of the country closely track the timing and intensity of the anti-schistosomiasis campaign haematobium infection called '' bilhvax '' underwent a phase 3 clinical trial among children in senegal : the results , reported in 2018 , showed that it was not effective despite provoking some immune response using crispr gene editing , researchers decreased the symptoms due to schistosomiasis in an animal model .
