thus the word cockpit came to mean a control center in an airliner , the cockpit is usually referred to as the flight deck , the term deriving from its use by the raf for the separate , upper platform in large flying boats where the pilot and co-pilot sat in the mid-1920s many aircraft manufacturers began using enclosed cockpits for the first time : airbusâ€”which features the glass cockpit concept ) both pilots use a side-stick located on the outboard side , so captain 's side-stick on the left and first-officer 's seat on the right the layout of the cockpit , especially in the military fast jet , has undergone standardisation , both within and between aircraft , manufacturers and even nations an important development was the '' basic six '' pattern , later the '' basic t '' , developed from 1937 onwards by the royal air force , designed to optimise pilot instrument scanning in the design of the cockpit in a military fast jet , the traditional '' knobs and dials '' associated with the cockpit are mainly absent automatic flight controls such as the autopilot are usually placed just below the windscreen and above the main instrument panel on the glareshield a multi-function display , usually a long narrow panel located centrally in front of the pilot , may be used to control heading , speed , altitude , vertical speed , vertical navigation and lateral navigation the primary flight display is usually located in a prominent position , either centrally or on either side of the cockpit in many cases an indicator of the engaged and armed autoflight system modes will be present along with some form of indication of the selected values for altitude , speed , vertical speed and heading the engine indication and crew alerting system ( used for boeing ) or electronic centralized aircraft monitor ( for airbus ) will allow the pilot to monitor the following information : values for n1 , n2 and n3 , fuel temperature , fuel flow , the electrical system , cockpit or cabin temperature and pressure , control surfaces and so on the flight management system/control unit may be used by the pilot to enter and check for the following information : flight plan , speed control , navigation control , and so on in a less prominent part of the cockpit , in case of failure of the other instruments , there will be a battery-powered integrated standby instrument system along with a magnetic compass , showing essential flight information such as speed , altitude , attitude and heading this standard defines the interface between an independent cockpit display system , generally produced by a single manufacturer , and the avionics equipment and user applications it is required to support , by means of displays and controls , often made by different manufacturers
