scipio , now powerful enough , proposed to end the war by directly invading the tunisia he was later authorized to employ the regular forces stationed in sicily , which consisted mainly of the remnants of the 5th and 6th legion , exiled to the island as a punishment for the humiliation they suffered at the battle of cannae under the treaty , carthage could keep its african territory but would lose its overseas empire , by that time a fait-accompli putting his cavalry on the flanks , with the inexperienced carthaginian cavalry on the right and the numidians on the left , hannibal aligned the rest of his troops in three straight lines behind his elephants hannibal intentionally held back his third infantry line , in order to thwart scipio 's tendency to pin the carthaginian center and envelop his opponent 's lines , as he had done at the battle of ilipa this was due in part to his raising of a new cavalry regiment in sicily and careful courting of masinissa as an ally hannibal most likely believed that the combination of the war elephants and the depth of the first two lines would weaken and disorganize the roman advance at the outset of the battle , hannibal unleashed his elephants and skirmishers against the roman army in order to break the cohesion of their lines and exploit the breaches that could be opened scipio 's plan to neutralize the threat of the elephants had worked ; his troops then fell back into traditional roman battle formation the carthaginian cavalry , acting on the instructions of hannibal , allowed the roman cavalry to chase them in order to lure them away from the battlefield so that they would n't attack the carthaginian armies in the rear hannibal ordered his second line not to allow the first line in their ranks with this reinforcement the roman front renewed their attack and defeated hannibal 's second line once the carthaginian cavalry was far enough away , they turned and attacked the roman cavalry but were eventually routed the battle finally turned in the romans ' favor when the roman cavalry returned to the battlefield and attacked the carthaginian line from behind hannibal experienced a major defeat that put an end to all resistance on the part of carthage unlike the treaty that ended the first punic war , the terms carthage acceded to were so punishing that it was never able to challenge rome for supremacy of the mediterranean again this startled the romans , who considered the carthaginian general a great potential threat as long as he lived one provision of the treaty ending the second punic war was that the carthaginians were not allowed to make war without roman consent though they fought with some success early on , the carthaginians simply could not defeat the by-then very aged masinissa once the armies of his roman allies arrived in africa unable to field a viable force in open combat and abandoned by all of their punic allies , the carthaginians commenced a spirited defense of their home city which , after an extended siege , was captured and completely destroyed in 146 & nbsp ; bc
