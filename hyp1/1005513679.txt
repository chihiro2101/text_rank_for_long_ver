the maya could use crown lands set aside as reservations , but these people lacked communal rights under the policy of indirect rule , a system of elected alcaldes ( mayors ) , adopted from spanish local government , linked these maya to the colonial administration however , the remoteness of the area of british honduras in which they settled , combined with their largely subsistence way of life , resulted in the mopán and kekchí maya maintaining more of their traditional way of life and becoming less assimilated into the colony than the maya of the north in different ways and to different degrees , then , the maya who returned to british honduras in the 19th century became incorporated into the colony as poor and dispossessed ethnic minorities largely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the maya , the expenses of administering the new colony of british honduras increased , and that at a time of severe depression in the economy the former group resisted the taxation of land and favoured an increase in import duties ; the latter preferred the opposite moreover , the merchants in the town felt relatively secure from mayan attacks and reluctant to contribute toward the protection of mahogany camps , whereas the landowners felt that they should not be required to pay taxes on lands given inadequate protection unable to agree among themselves , the members of the legislative assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for the establishment of direct british rule in return for the greater security of crown colony status this constitutional change confirmed and completed a change in the locus and form of power in the colony 's political economy that had evolved during the preceding half-century the new company was the chief force in british honduras 's political economy for over a century the manager of the belize estate and produce company , for example , was automatically a member of the council , while members of the emerging creole elite were excluded from holding seats on the council in the 1920s , the colonial office supported agitation for an elective council as long as the governor had reserve powers to allow him to push through any measures he considered essential without the council 's assent a brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the united states creoles , who were well-connected with businesses in the united states , challenged the traditional political-economic connection with britain as trade with the united states intensified the belize estate and produce company survived the depression years because of its special connections in british honduras and london after the elections , the governor promptly appointed brown to the council , presumably to maintain the influence of what had for so long been the colony 's chief business but brown 's defeat by turton , one of the company 's chief local business rivals , marked the decline of old british enterprises in relation to the rising creole entrepreneurs with their united states commercial connections a group calling itself the unemployed brigade marched through belize town on 14 february 1934 , to present demands to the governor and started a broad movement of most immediate importance was the creation of relief work by a governor who saw it as a way to avoid civil disturbances poor people , therefore , could not vote ; they could only support members of the creole middle classes that opposed big-business candidates working-class agitation continued , and in 1939 all six seats on the belize town board ( the voting requirements allowed for a more representative electorate ) went to middle-class creoles who appeared more sympathetic to labour employers among the unofficial members at the legislative council defeated a bill to repeal these penal clauses in august 1941 , but the employers and workers bill passed on 27 april 1943 , finally removed breach-of-labour-contract from the criminal code and enabled british honduras 's infant trade unions to pursue the struggle for improving labour conditions the general workers ' union ( gwu ) , registered in 1943 , quickly expanded into a nationwide organisation and provided crucial support for the nationalist movement that took off with the formation of the people 's united party ( pup ) in 1950 it was a decade during which the old phenomena of exploitative labour conditions and authoritarian colonial and industrial relations began to give way to new labour and political processes and institutions the third group consisted of people such as the christian social action group ( csag ) who engaged in electoral politics within the narrow limits defined by the constitution and whose goals included a '' natives first '' campaign and an extension of the franchise to elect a more representative government one member of this group , george cadle price , topped the polls in the 1947 election when he opposed immigration schemes and import controls and rode a wave of feeling against a british proposal for a federation of its colonies in the caribbean he remained the predominant politician in the country from the early 1950s until his retirement in 1996 in spite of repeated denials by the governor that the british honduras dollar would be devalued to maintain the old exchange rate with the british pound , devaluation was nevertheless effected by the governor , using his reserve powers in defiance of the legislative council the devaluation enraged labour because it protected the interests of the big transnationals , such as the belize estate and produce company , whose trade in british pounds would have suffered without devaluation while it subjected british honduras 's working class , already experiencing widespread unemployment and poverty , to higher prices for goods—especially food—imported from the united states devaluation thus united labour , nationalists and the creole middle classes in opposition to the colonial administration on the night that the governor declared the devaluation , the people 's committee was formed and the nascent independence movement suddenly matured before the end of january 1950 , the gwu and the people 's committee were holding joint public meetings and discussing issues such as devaluation , labour legislation , the proposed west indies federation , and constitutional reform the gwu was the only mass organisation of working people , so the early success of the independence movement would have been impossible without the support of this union on 29 september 1950 , the people 's committee was dissolved and the people 's united party ( pup ) formed in its place between 1950 and 1954 , the people 's united party consolidated its organisation , established its popular base , and articulated its primary demands the political leaders took control of the union to use its strength , and in turn the union movement declined as it became increasingly dependent upon politicians in the 1950s in short , pup pushed for representative and responsible government the colonial administration , alarmed by the growing support for the pup , retaliated by attacking two of the party 's chief public platforms the removal of three of four chief leaders was a blow to the party , but the events left price in a powerful position within just two years , despite persecution and division , the pup had become a powerful political force , and george price had clearly become the party 's leader the leaders of the pup , however , perceived british honduras as belonging to neither britain nor guatemala british honduras faced two obstacles to independence : british reluctance until the early 1960s to allow citizens to govern themselves , and guatemala 's complete intransigence over its long-standing claim to the entire territory by 1961 , the united kingdom was willing to let the colony become independent and from 1964 controlled only defence , foreign affairs , internal security , and the terms and conditions of the public service even after belize became independent in 1981 , however , the territorial dispute remained unsettled guatemala had an alternative view that this agreement stated that guatemala would give up its territorial claims only under certain conditions , including the construction of a road from guatemala to the caribbean coast britain argued that because neither the short-lived central american federation ( 1821–1839 ) nor guatemala had ever exercised any authority in the area or even protested the british presence in the 19th century , british honduras was clearly under british sovereignty as a result , in 1965 the united states president lyndon johnson agreed to mediate and proposed a draft treaty that gave guatemala control over the newly independent country in areas including internal security , defence and external affairs in the early days , the colonists governed themselves under a public meeting system , similar to the town meeting system used in new england in 1853 the public meeting system was abandoned in favour of a legislative assembly , part of which was elected by a restricted franchise due largely to extremely harsh working conditions , the colony experienced four slave revolts , the first in 1765 and the last in 1820 colonial officials provided incentives during the 1860s that resulted in a large influx of americans from the southern united states , especially louisiana , during and after the american civil war the confederate settlements in british honduras introduced large-scale sugar production to the colony and proved that it could be profitable where others had previously failed in the 1950s agriculture finally became a dominant part of economy , and in the 1970s fishing became significant
