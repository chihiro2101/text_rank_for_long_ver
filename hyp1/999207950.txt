the stars that make up pisces and the middle portion of modern andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess , sometimes named as anunitum or the lady of the heavens however , there is no universal depiction of andromeda and the stars used to represent her body , head , and chains arab astronomers were aware of ptolemy 's constellations , but they included a second constellation representing a fish at andromeda 's feet like all those that date back to a pattern known to ptolemy , it is attributed to a wider zone and thus many surrounding stars an arab constellation called '' al-hut '' ( the fish ) was composed of several stars in andromeda , m31 , and several stars in pisces the arabic names are a reference to the fact that α and forms an asterism known as the '' great square of pegasus '' with three stars in pegasus : α , β , and γ peg however , β and was mostly considered by the arabs to be a part of al-hut , a constellation representing a larger fish than pisces at andromeda 's feet γ and ( almach ) is an orange-hued bright giant star of type k3 found at the southern tip of the constellation with an overall magnitude of 2.14 the primary star has a planetary system with four confirmed planets , 0.96 times , 14.57 times , 10.19 times and 1.06 the mass of jupiter it is 177 light-years from earth and is an orange-hued giant star of type k3 the primary is a yellow-hued giant star of type k0 with an apparent magnitude of 5.7 that is 316 light-years away the secondary is an orange-hued giant star of type k0 and magnitude 5.9 that is 990 light-years from earth it orbits at a distance of 0.83 astronomical units from its parent star every 186 days and has a mass of of the stars brighter than 4th magnitude ( and those with measured luminosity ) , andromeda has a relatively even distribution of evolved and main sequence stars the constellation of andromeda lies well away from the galactic plane , so it does not contain any of the open clusters or bright nebulae of the milky way because of its distance in the sky from the band of obscuring dust , gas , and abundant stars of our home galaxy , andromeda 's borders contain many visible distant galaxies it is an enormous & nbsp ; – 192.4 by 62.2 arcminutes in apparent size & nbsp ; – barred spiral galaxy similar in form to the milky way and at an approximate magnitude of 3.5 , is one of the brightest deep-sky objects in the northern sky despite being visible to the naked eye , the '' little cloud '' near andromeda 's figure was not recorded until ad 964 , when the arab astronomer al-sufi wrote his book of fixed stars the distance he found was far greater than the size of the milky way , which led him to the conclusion that many similar objects were '' island universes '' on their own the andromeda galaxy 's two main companions , m32 and m110 ( also known as ngc 221 and ngc 205 , respectively ) are faint elliptical galaxies that lie near it m32 , visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes , compared to m110 , appears superimposed on the larger galaxy in a telescopic view as a hazy smudge , m110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy ; m32 is 0.5° south of the core , m32 is 1° northwest of the core along with the andromeda galaxy and its companions , the constellation also features ngc 891 ( caldwell 23 ) , a smaller galaxy just east of almach it is a loosely scattered cluster in the milky way that measures 49 arcminutes across and features approximately twelve bright stars , although more than 60 stars of approximately 9th magnitude become visible at low magnifications in a telescope the other open cluster in andromeda is ngc 7686 , which has a similar magnitude of 5.6 and is also a part of the milky way lying approximately three degrees southwest of iota andromedae at a distance of about 4,000 light-years from earth , the '' blue snowball nebula '' is a popular target for amateur astronomers it earned its popular name because it appears as a faint , round , blue-green object in a telescope , with an overall magnitude of 9.2 upon further magnification , it is visible as a slightly elliptical annular disk that gets darker towards the center , with a magnitude 13.2 central star andromedid meteors are known for being very slow and the shower itself is considered to be diffuse , as meteors can be seen coming from nearby constellations as well as from andromeda itself
