smolin has worked since the early 1980s on a series of proposals for hidden variables theories , which would be non-local deterministic theories which would give a precise description of individual quantum phenomena in recent years , he has pioneered two new approaches to the interpretation of quantum mechanics suggested by his work on the reality of time , called the real ensemble interpretation and the principle of precedence when smolin published the theory in 1992 , he proposed as a prediction of his theory that no neutron star should exist with a mass of more than 1.6 times the mass of the sun smolin has contributed to the philosophy of physics through a series of papers and books that advocate the relational , or leibnizian , view of space and time , ( 2014 ) , the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy , cambridge university press , a book length exposition of smolin 's philosophical views appeared in april 2013 time reborn argues that physical science has made time unreal while , as smolin insists , it is the most fundamental feature of reality : '' space may be an illusion , but time must be real '' ( p smolin 's 2006 book the trouble with physics explored the role of controversy and disagreement in the progress of science as a case study , the trouble with physics focused on the issue of the falsifiability of string theory due to the proposals that the anthropic principle be used to explain the properties of our universe in the context of the string landscape in his earlier book three roads to quantum gravity ( 2002 ) , smolin stated that loop quantum gravity and string theory were essentially the same concept seen from different perspectives the trouble with physics , on the other hand , was strongly critical of the prominence of string theory in contemporary theoretical physics , which he believes has suppressed research in other promising approaches finally , the trouble with physics is also broadly concerned with the role of controversy and the value of diverse approaches in the ethics and process of science in the same year that the trouble with physics was published , peter woit published a book for nonspecialists whose conclusion was similar to smolin 's , namely that string theory was a fundamentally flawed research program smolin 's view on the nature of time : more and more , i have the feeling that quantum theory and general relativity are both deeply wrong about the nature of time i believe this because i have never encountered an interpretation of the present formulation of quantum mechanics that makes sense to me i have studied most of them in depth and thought hard about them , and in the end i still ca n't make real sense of quantum theory as it stands smolin 's response to the question '' what do you believe is true even though you can not prove it ? '' '' world question center 2005 : lee smolin '' edge in a 2009 article , smolin articulated the following philosophical views ( the sentences in italics are quotations ) : there is only one universe this principle also rules out the notion of a mathematical object isomorphic in every respect to the history of the entire universe , a notion more metaphysics than scientific '' a possible solution for the problem of time in quantum cosmology '' on edge ( april 7 , 1997 ) the trouble with physics was named by newsweek magazine as number 17 on a list of 50 '' books for our time '' , june 27 , 2009 the trouble with physics : the rise of string theory , the fall of a science , and what comes next a partial list of smolin 's published work a debate of the merits of string theory between smolin and brian greene , from national public radio ( 2006 ) '' the unique universe '' : smolin explains his skepticism re the multiverse ( 2009 ) closer to the truth : series of interviews by smolin on fundamental issues in physics : smolin 's presentation at the royal society of arts ( 2013 )
