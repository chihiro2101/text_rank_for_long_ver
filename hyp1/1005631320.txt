between 1930 and 1932 , senator carter glass ( d-va ) introduced several versions of a bill ( known in each version as the glass bill ) to regulate or prohibit the combination of commercial and investment banking and to establish other reforms ( except deposit insurance ) similar to the final provisions of the 1933 banking act the senate passed a version of the glass bill that would have required commercial banks to eliminate their securities affiliates the final glass–steagall provisions contained in the 1933 banking act reduced from five years to one year the period in which commercial banks were required to eliminate such affiliations it also includes how the deposit insurance provisions of the bill were very controversial at the time , which almost led to the rejection of the bill once again the previous glass bills before the final revision all had similar goals and brought up the same objectives , which were to separate commercial from investment banking , bring more banking activities under federal reserve supervision , and to allow branch banking in may 1933 , steagall 's addition of allowing state-chartered banks to receive federal deposit insurance and shortening the time in which banks needed to eliminate securities affiliates to one year was known as the driving force of what helped the glass–steagall act to be signed into law the law gave banks one year after the law was passed on june 16 , 1933 to decide whether they would be a commercial bank or an investment bank whereas a federal reserve member bank could not buy , sell , underwrite , or deal in any security except as specifically permitted by section 16 , such a bank could affiliate with a company so long as that company was not '' engaged principally '' in such activities starting in 1987 , the federal reserve board interpreted this to mean a member bank could affiliate with a securities firm so long as that firm was not '' engaged principally '' in securities activities prohibited for a bank by section 16 by the time the glba repealed the glass–steagall affiliation restrictions , the federal reserve board had interpreted this '' loophole '' in those restrictions to mean a banking company ( citigroup , as owner of citibank ) could acquire one of the world 's largest securities firms ( salomon smith barney ) as time passed , however , the separation became so controversial that in 1935 , senator glass himself attempted to '' repeal '' the prohibition on direct bank underwriting by permitting a limited amount of bank underwriting of corporate debt financial sector firms established a favorable view of deregulation in american political circles , and in using its political influence in congress to overturn key provisions of glass-steagall and to dismantle other major provisions of statutes and regulations that govern financial firms and the risks they may take after the financial crisis of 2007–2008 , some commentators argued that the repeal of sections 20 and 32 had played an important role in leading to the housing bubble and financial crisis instead , the five year anniversary of its repeal was marked by numerous sources explaining that the glba had not significantly changed the market structure of the banking and securities industries following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 , legislators unsuccessfully tried to reinstate glass–steagall sections 20 and 32 as part of the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act glass–steagall act & nbsp ; – further readings on the systematic dismemberment of the act from pbs 's frontline full text of the glass–steagall act followed by new york federal reserve bank explanation glass subcommittee hearings pecora investigation hearings fdic history : 1933-1983 1987 federal reserve bank of kansas city jackson hole symposium on restructuring the financial system public law 73-66 , 73d congress , h.r
