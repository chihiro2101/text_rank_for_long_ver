alt unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts , this breed was not developed simply by selective breeding the rough collie for smaller and smaller size a shaded dog ( one with a lot of black overlay on a sable coat ) may or may not be tri-factored or bi-factored a bi-black sheltie carries two bi-black genes ; thus any dog with a bi-black parent is always bi-factored whatever its own coat color is sable merles are shown in the breed ring as sables ; therefore , blue eyes are a major fault in akc white factoring affects the amount of white on the dog it is hard to tell , without actually breeding , whether a dog is white-factored or not , though dogs with white going up the stifle ( the front of the hind leg ) are usually assumed to be white-factored for show dogs , dogs more than 50 percent white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring ; they are normal in every other way double merles , a product of breeding two merle shelties together , have a very high incidence of deafness or blindness accepted height ranges may differ depending on country and standard used in the us and canada , breed standards state that males and females can be between , all other standards ( australia , new zealand and uk ) specify males : , females : except fci which specifies females : at the shoulder ( withers ) , however , some shelties can be found outside of these ranges but are not considered truly representative of the breed variation can be found within litters , and height ( in the range of is above the breed standard in some lines if a dog 's ears are not bent ( referred to as prick ears ) some owners brace them into the correct position for several weeks to several months wide-set ( too much distance between ) ears are also not a desired trait , nor are ears which tip too low down ( referred to as 'hound ' ears ) the topcoat consists of long , straight , water-repellent hair , which provides protection from cold and the elements females will also shed right before or right after giving birth male shelties technically shed less than females but fur still comes off constantly this makes them much easier to groom and clean up after than many smooth-haired dogs , which leave loose fur in their space although small breed dogs do not usually suffer unduly from hip dysplasia , it has been identified in shelties that is , the severity of the disease at birth will not change throughout the dog 's life breeders should actively try to breed this disease out by only breeding with dogs that have '' clear '' eyes or very low scoring eyes a cea score considered too high to breed with may still be low enough not to affect the dog 's life pra can be detected at any time but usually does not show up until the dog is around two years old breeding dogs should be tested for genotype for this condition before breeding and only animals found '' clear '' should be used for breeding both male and female should be tested for thyroid problems , von willebrands disease and brucellosis , as well as have hip x-rays and eyes cleared by the relevant national authorities breeding colours are also a problem for many beginner breeders certain colour combinations can produce unwanted or potentially harmful results , such as mating blue merle to blue merle , which can produce what is called a '' double merle '' , more likely to suffer from deafness or blindness ) there are many more examples of breeding for colour , so a good breeder will research colour genetics prior to breeding dogs carrying mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success , having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog this breed is rarely aggressive and tends to do well with children and being handled by them
