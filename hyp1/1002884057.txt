the flowers are in corymbs of 15â€“30 together , yellow to yellow-green with five sepals and five petals long ; flowering occurs in early spring before the new leaves emerge under ideal conditions in its native range , norway maple may live up to 250 years , but often has a much shorter life expectancy ; in north america , for example , sometimes only 60 years the norway maple is a member ( and is the type species ) of the section platanoidea pax , characterised by flattened , disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap from the field maple , the norway maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed , not blunt , lobes , and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes flowering and seed production begins at ten years of age , however large quantities of seeds are not produced until the tree is 20 as with most maples , norway maple is normally dioecious ( separate male and female trees ) , occasionally monoecious , and trees may change gender from year to year the sugar maple usually has a brighter orange autumn color , where the norway maple is usually yellow , although some of the red-leaved cultivars appear more orange the heavy seed crop and high germination rate contributes to its invasiveness in north america , where it forms dense monotypic stands that choke out native vegetation since norway maple 's leafout in spring is also tied to photoperiod unlike most north american trees which leaf out based on air temperature , the tree has a competitive advantage in that it may leaf out well before native trees and shrubs since the latter may be delayed by the weather conditions by comparison , in its native range , norway maple is rarely a dominant species and instead occurs mostly as a scattered understory tree the norway maple was introduced to northeastern north america between 1750 and 1760 as an ornamental shade tree the roots of norway maples grow very close to the ground surface , starving other plants of moisture for example , lawn grass ( and even weeds ) will usually not grow well beneath a norway maple , but english ivy , with its minimal rooting needs , may thrive the norway maple also suffers less herbivory than the sugar maple , allowing it to gain a competitive advantage against the latter species despite these steps , the species is still available and widely used for urban plantings in many areas file : acer platanoides fruit kz.jpg fruit ( samara ) : note the flat seed capsule and the angle of the '' wings '' file:2014-10-30 10 39 54 norway maple foliage during autumn on durham avenue in ewing , new jersey.jpg typical yellow fall foliage file:2014-10-30 09 32 43 norway maple foliage during autumn in ewing , new jersey.jpg atypical orange-red fall colour file : acer platanoides 'schwedleri ' leaf.jpg purple leaves of cultivar 'schwedleri' file : acer platanoides twig and buds.jpg acer platanoides twig and buds
