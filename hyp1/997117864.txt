the writ of prohibition mandates the inferior court to cease any action over the case because it may not fall within that inferior court 's jurisdiction in some cases , this writ may also be used to prevent an inferior court from acting contrary to the rules of natural justice however , unlike a writ of prohibition , superior courts issue writs of certiorari to review decisions which inferior courts have already made a writ of prohibition is issued primarily to prevent an inferior court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction in cases pending before it or acting contrary to the rules of natural justice when the court , before whom the matter is pending , has ceased to exist , in that condition too , the writ of prohibition will not lie because there can be no proceedings upon which it can operate but on the other hand , if the court is functioning , the writ can be issued at any stage of the proceeding before the inferior court or tribunal writs could be issued against another court or an individual defendant , somewhat similar to the way an injunction works in courts today as courts of equity provided new relief that before had been encompassed by but limited in the common law courts , writs of prohibition helped prevent plaintiffs from being able to '' forum shop '' for the court that would be most favorable to their position any plaintiff who could gain adequate relief in a common law court was prohibited from bringing his case in a different court , even if he preferred the procedure , allowable defenses , or possible remedies of a different court the use of the writ of prohibition also varied with the relationship between the chancery and the common law judges while at the beginning of the transformation of the chancery into a judicial body , the common law judges often cooperated in helping the new court decide cases or even referred plaintiffs who had equitable claims that meant that if a party wanted to halt proceedings in another court on the grounds that the presiding court did not have proper jurisdictional authority , the party would petition the managing courts to do one of the following things : ( 1 ) eliminate liability altogether by applying common law , ( 2 ) have the case be sued de novo at common law , or ( 3 ) secure trial by the common law method of a jury or judicial ruling prior to deciding whether or not to grant the writ , the managing court would usually allow for open-court debate between the plaintiff seeking prohibition , the defendant opposing prohibition , and/or the judges themselves if the chancellor agreed , he could issue a writ of consultation , reversing the writ of prohibition and allowing the case to continue in the ecclesiastical court
