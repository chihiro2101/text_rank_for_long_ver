rather than face steady demise as the new form of transport developed , a number of the proprietors formed the manchester & lincoln union railway company in october 1845 the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level however , the owners considered options for converting the canal from kiverton park to chesterfield into a railway in 1872 , 1873 and 1884 , but on each occasion , the plans were shelved the original route of the canal at hague lane was largely destroyed by the construction of the railway and renishaw central station , but further north , the section around chapel wheel forge and dam is still clearly visible , and reinstatement of it as part of a restored canal was considered but rejected on practical grounds prior to construction of this section , the canal looped to the north around the iron works , passing through cinderhill lock before turning south-eastwards some 40 boats were still working on the canal , although a short section between staveley and chesterfield had become unnavigable responsibility for the canal passed the london and north eastern railway ( lner ) in 1923 , who carried out regular maintenance , and repaired and enlarged the lock connecting west stockwith basin to the river trent between 1923 and 1925 the british transport commission agreed to keep the canal open for two more years in 1962 , although the lockgates from worksop to kiveton were removed , and the lock walls bulldozed , on the grounds of public safety progress beyond worksop moved forwards rapidly in 1995 , when a derelict land grant was obtained by nottinghamshire county council , and with additional funding from british coal , a £4.5 million scheme began to restore the canal between worksop and the aqueduct over the river ryton which forms the county boundary three bridges had been rebuilt with navigable headroom , one over tylden road , the main access road into rhodesia , an adjacent one that provided access to nearby cottages , and one which carried shireoaks common over the canal near to shireoaks railway station however , in practice progress had been slow , and attention turned to the section west of norwood tunnel , where much more damage had been done to the canal bed , with it being filled in and built over in many places the last few miles of the canal , from chesterfield to staveley , were in reasonable condition , although the towpath was overgrown and difficult to access , while much of the route was under threat from opencast coal mining and a planned bypass , which had first been proposed in 1927 in a separate development , a private owner of a length of the canal near boiley farm , killamarsh , obtained a derelict land grant to enable him to restore around of the channel in 1992 the work included the new renishaw foundry footbridge ( 18a ) , which connects the housing to green space and a play area on the bank of the canal , and deep piling where an embankment originally carried the canal over the smithy brook over the winter of 2010–11 , the canal trust obtained its first permanent base , when the lock house at hollingwood lock was renovated and a large extension added to the rear the next big advance was the opening of some of canal beyond mill green bridge , and the construction of a new mooring basin at staveley , which was completed in early 2012 the solution adopted to overcome this was the construction of a dropped pound , with a new staveley town lock ( 5a ) immediately to the north of staveley basin to lower the level of the canal , and railway lock ( 5b ) constructed just beyond the railway bridge although the track on the mineral line has been removed , its route may be reused to provide access to a maintenance depot , for the high speed 2 ( hs2 ) railway project on 1 october 2017 , the trust received permission from network rail to investigate the bridge remains , and the infill was removed over the next few days the project involves the creation of a short length of new canal to create an island in the centre of the site , navigation being restored to a length of the river , and a new basin at the southern edge of the site the basin was completed and was opened in october 2009 , although it remains isolated from the river rother , to which it will be connected by a lock , while a back-pumping facility will supply it with water whereas most of the work so far had involved restoration of the existing channel , this section includes some significant engineering challenges , with completely new construction needed to bypass the housing estate in killamarsh , built over the original line in the 1970s , and the replacement of norwood tunnel with an alternative route at the time , the eastern route was felt to be the best option , and consultation with residents resulted in that route being included in the north east derbyshire local plan it will not be possible to reopen the norwood tunnel , as several sections have collapsed , the national coal board filled in some sections to stabilise the land above it , and when the m1 motorway was built , the tunnel below it was injection grouted , to ensure there would not be a subsequent collapse the engineers arup considered options for this section in 2007 , proposing a route running largely on the surface , and crossing the site of the kiveton park colliery , which closed in 1994 one is for a short tunnel at the western end , starting at the existing western portal , but heading in a different direction in 2012 the uk government 's announcement of the preferred route for the hs2 rail line extension to leeds indicated that the line would conflict with the planned restoration of the canal in several places what are often called '' traditional '' working narrowboats were the product of the main canal system – but the craft that plied the 46 miles between chesterfield , retford , and the river trent were very different this has enabled the canal trust to create a new boat , named the dawn rose , which was constructed at shireoaks marina using traditional methods although a small section of it at the eastern end may be reused as part of the restoration , most of it will remain abandoned , as it has suffered from subsidence , and parts of it have been filled in
