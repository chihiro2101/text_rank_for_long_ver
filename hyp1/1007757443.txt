in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown constitutional precedence has even established the unwritten but binding rule that the monarch must give assent to any parliamentary decision , regardless of any other considerations ( which can only be advanced in private audience with government members , not imposed ) , as soon as the government presents it for royal signature and thus assumes full political responsibility instead , he requested that the cabinet declare him unable to reign for a day , which it did , thereby assuming the king 's constitutional powers within the dominions , until the 1920s , most reserve powers were exercised by a governor-general on the advice of either the local or the british government , though the latter took precedence for example , the first governor-general of the irish free state , tim healy , was instructed by the british dominions office in 1922 to withhold the royal assent on any bill passed by the two houses of the oireachtas ( the irish parliament ) that attempted to change or abolish the oath of allegiance while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis '' the reserve power of dismissal has never been used in canada , although other reserve powers have been employed to force the prime minister to resign on two occasions : the first took place in 1896 , when the prime minister , sir charles tupper , refused to step down after his party did not win a majority in the house of commons during that year 's election , leading governor general the earl of aberdeen to no longer recognize tupper as prime minister and disapprove of several appointments tupper had recommended at the provincial level , on 29 june 2017 lieutenant governor of british columbia judith guichon used her reserve powers to deny the request of premier christy clark to dissolve the legislature and call a new election only 51 days after the recent provincial election clark had advised guichon to dissolve the legislature as , in her view , the appointment of a speaker would have resulted in frequent tie votes and an untenable position guichon refused this advice and instead asked john horgan to form a government , becoming the new premier peter hogg , a constitutional scholar , has opined that '' a system of responsible government can not work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers sir kenneth keith describes the use of these powers as based on the principle that '' the queen reigns , but the government rules , so long as it has the support of the house of representatives '' this power is exercised every time a general election results in a change of government , most recently in 2017 it may also be exercised if a prime minister no-confidence motion and resigns instead of advising a dissolution of parliament ; the last such occasion was in 1912 though the power of appointment is listed among the reserve powers , in fact the governor-general abides by strict conventions , and has always appointed the leader of the dominant party in the house of representatives the governor-general retains the theoretical power to appoint as prime minister a member of the house of representatives who clearly does not have the support of a majority of mps , but no governor-general has sought to use this power since new zealand gained responsible government , though some cabinets in the 19th century proved extremely short-lived today , however , the practice of appointing – on prime ministerial advice – a permanent deputy prime minister , who becomes acting prime minister when needed , has largely removed even this discretion from the governor-general dissolving parliament and calling for elections is part of the governor-general 's normal duties ; every parliamentary dissolution and subsequent general election in new zealand 's history has been called by the governor or governor-general however , all elections since responsible government was introduced , including snap elections , have been requested by the incumbent premier or prime minister , and are accordingly not examples of use of the reserve powers many constitutional commentators believe that the governor-general ( or the sovereign ) no longer has the power to refuse royal assent to any bill properly passed by the house of representatives - former law professor and prime minister sir geoffrey palmer and professor matthew palmer argue any refusal of royal assent would lead to a constitutional crisis in the 1890s , premier john ballance advised the governor to make several new appointments to the ( since abolished ) legislative council the opposition immediately called for the government to reconvene parliament , so that a motion of no confidence could be introduced , and a new government formed '' tuvalu ’ s opposition waiting to hear from gg '' , islands business , 1 july 2013 prime minister telavi responded that , under the constitution , he was only required to convene parliament once a year ( for a vote on the budget ) , and was thus under no obligation to summon it until december in the uk , the monarch has numerous theoretical personal prerogatives , but beyond the appointment of a prime minister , there are in practice few circumstances in modern british government where these prerogatives could be justifiably exercised ; they have rarely been exercised in the last century in october 2003 the government made public the following prerogatives but it said at the time that a comprehensive catalogue of prerogative powers could not be supplied : to refuse to dissolve parliament when requested by the prime minister harold wilson , leading a minority government in 1974 , was advised elizabeth ii might refuse to dissolve parliament if she could identify an alternative prime minister able to command a cross-party majority to summon and prorogue parliament to command the armed forces to dismiss and appoint ministers to commission officers in the armed forces to appoint queen 's counsel to issue and withdraw passports to create corporations via royal charter to appoint bishops and archbishops of the church of england to grant honours to grant the prerogative of mercy to delay a bill 's assent through the use of his or her reserve powers in near-revolutionary situations , thereby vetoing the bill to refuse the royal assent of a parliamentary bill on the advice of ministers , thomas erskine may 's parliamentary practice , page 373 , 2nd edition , 1851 last exercised by queen anne when she withheld royal assent from the scottish militia bill 1708 to declare war and peace to deploy the armed forces overseas to ratify and make treaties to refuse the '' queen 's consent queen 's king 's consent '' , where direct monarchical assent is required for a bill affecting , directly or by implication , the prerogative , hereditary revenues—including ultimus haeres , treasure trove , and bona vacantia—or the personal property or interests of the crown to be heard in parliament in 1999 , queen elizabeth ii , acting on the advice of the government , refused to signify her consent to the military action against iraq ( parliamentary approval ) bill , which sought to transfer from the monarch to parliament the power to authorise military strikes against iraq for example , in the hung parliament in 1974 , the serving prime minister , edward heath , attempted to remain in power but was unable to form a working majority the constitution of spain does not specifically grant emergency powers to the government , though does state in article 56 that the monarch '' arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions '' , and invests the monarch with the responsibility of overseeing that the forms of the constitution are observed often minor parties form part of a larger major party , and through that membership it can be said that the king fulfills his constitutional mandate of consulting with party representatives with congressional representation title iv government and administration section 99 ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) ( 1 ) after each renewal of the congress and the other cases provided for under the constitution , the king shall , after consultation with the representatives appointed by the political groups with parliamentary representation , and through the speaker of the congress , nominate for the presidency of the government article 92 invests the king with the right to call for referendum on the advice of the president and the previous authorization of congress the king , however , is not subordinate to the government and thus could play an independent role as moral authority , but the prevailing convention , expressed in the preparatory works of the 1974 instrument of government , is that the king should stay away from anything which could reasonably be interpreted as courtyard speech reserve powers can also be written into a republican constitution that separates the offices of head of state and head of government during this time , the president may not use his prerogative to dissolve the national assembly and call early elections the german constitution limits the powers available to the president to prevent a situation in which the executive could effectively rule without legislative approval , which was the case in the weimar republic however , in case of a '' legislative emergency '' the german president can accept legislation without approval of the '' bundestag '' ( parliament ) article 81 of the german constitution states the possibility that the president can by this means keep a government capable of action even in case of loss of a constructive majority in the bundestag however , the president has certain reserve powers , also known as '' discretionary powers '' in ireland , which can be exercised by the president at his or her discretion – without , or even contrary to , the government 's advice the first of these means that a taoiseach who has been defeated by a vote of no-confidence can not automatically expect to appeal to the people by calling a general election by the second of these powers , the president may refuse to assent to legislation passed by parliament when he or she considers it to be unconstitutional the president may decide to call a referendum on legislation '' of great national significance '' the president of the republic : can send official messages to the chambers of parliament ; appoints the prime minister of italy ; may appoint up to five senator for life ; appoints a third of the judges of the constitutional court ; can grant pardons and commutation of sentence ; can call for new elections for both or only one of the chambers , except during the last six months of his term if the rejected law is passed again by a majority in the parliament , however , the president must sign it
