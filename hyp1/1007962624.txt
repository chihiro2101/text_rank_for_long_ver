european sailors may have first noticed the clouds during the middle ages when they were used for navigation in 1908 , the results of her study were published , which showed that a type of variable star called a '' cluster variable '' , later called a cepheid variable after the prototype star delta cephei , showed a definite relationship between the variability period and the star 's apparent brightness leavitt reaized that since all the stars in the smc are roughly the same distance from earth , this result implied that there is similar relationship between period and absolute brightness she hoped a few cepheid variables could be found close enough to earth so that their parallax , and hence distance from earth , could be measured announced in 2006 , measurements with the hubble space telescope suggest the large and small magellanic clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the milky way in 2017 , using dark energy survey plus maglites data , a stellar over-density associated with the small magellanic cloud was discovered , which is probably the result of interactions between smc and lmc recent star formation has led to a large population of massive stars and high-mass x-ray binaries ( hmxbs ) which are the relics of the short-lived upper end of the initial mass function 2010 have now cataloged several hundred x-ray sources in the direction of the smc , of which perhaps half are considered likely hmxbs , and the remainder a mix of foreground stars , and background agn visvanathan that the smc may in fact be split in two , with a smaller section of this galaxy behind the main part of the smc ( as seen from earth perspective ) , and separated by about 30,000 ly they suggest the reason for this is due to a past interaction with the lmc splitting the smc , and that the two sections are still moving apart nasa extragalactic database entry on the smc seds entry on the smc smc at esa/hubble astronomy picture of the day 2010 january 7 the tail of the small magellanic cloud - likely stripped from the galaxy by gravitational tides , the tail contains mostly gas , dust , and newly formed stars
