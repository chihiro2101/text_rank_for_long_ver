mirna research revealed different sets of mirnas expressed in different cell types and tissues and multiple roles for mirnas in plant and animal development and in many other biological processes in 2000 , a second small rna was characterized : let-7 rna , which represses lin-41 to promote a later developmental transition in c the let-7 rna was found to be conserved in many species , leading to the suggestion that let-7 rna and additional '' small temporal rnas '' might regulate the timing of development in diverse animals , including humans this suggested that most might function in other types of regulatory pathways for example : : hsa-mir-181a : : hsa-mir-181b : pre-mirnas , -mirnas and genes that lead to 100 % identical mature mirnas but that are located at different places in the genome are indicated with an additional dash-number suffix plant mirnas usually have near-perfect pairing with their mrna targets , which induces gene repression through cleavage of the target transcripts in contrast , animal mirnas are able to recognize their target mrnas by using as few as 6–8 nucleotides ( the seed region ) at the 5 ' end of the mirna , which is not enough pairing to induce cleavage of the target mrnas a given mirna may have hundreds of different mrna targets , and a given target might be regulated by multiple mirnas estimates of the average number of unique messenger rnas that are targets for repression by a typical mirna vary , depending on the estimation method , but multiple approaches show that mammalian mirnas can have many unique targets likewise , experiments show that a single mirna species can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique messenger rnas other experiments show that a single mirna species may repress the production of hundreds of proteins , but that this repression often is relatively mild ( much less than 2-fold ) the dna template is not the final word on mature mirna production : 6 % of human mirnas show rna editing ( isomir ) , the site-specific modification of rna sequences to yield products different from those encoded by their dna animal mirnas are initially transcribed as part of one arm of an ∼80 nucleotide rna stem-loop that in turn forms part of a several hundred nucleotide-long mirna precursor termed a pri-mirna as many as 16 % of pre-mirnas may be altered through nuclear rna editing rna editing can halt nuclear processing ( for example , of pri-mir-142 , leading to degradation by the ribonuclease tudor-sn ) and alter downstream processes including cytoplasmic mirna processing and target specificity ( e.g although either strand of the duplex may potentially act as a functional mirna , only one strand is usually incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex ( risc ) where the mirna and its mrna target interact while the majority of mirnas are located within the cell , some mirnas , commonly known as circulating mirnas or extracellular mirnas , have also been found in extracellular environment , including various biological fluids and cell culture media the mature mirna is part of an active rna-induced silencing complex ( risc ) containing dicer and many associated proteins in some cases , both strands of the duplex are viable and become functional mirna that target different mrna populations argonautes are needed for mirna-induced silencing and contain two conserved rna binding domains : a paz domain that can bind the single stranded 3 ' end of the mature mirna and a piwi domain that structurally resembles ribonuclease h and functions to interact with the 5 ' end of the guide strand some argonautes , for example human ago2 , cleave target transcripts directly ; argonautes may also recruit additional proteins to achieve translational repression the human genome encodes eight argonaute proteins divided by sequence similarities into two families : ago ( with four members present in all mammalian cells and called e1f2c/hago in humans ) , and piwi ( found in the germ line and hematopoietic stem cells ) gene silencing may occur either via mrna degradation or preventing mrna from being translated some mirnas work as buffers of random gene expression changes arising due to stochastic events in transcription , translation and protein stability in what has been called a '' use it or lose it '' strategy , argonaute may preferentially retain mirnas with many targets over mirnas with few or no targets , leading to degradation of the non-targeting molecules the actual work of rna silencing is performed by risc in which the main catalytic subunit is one of the argonaute proteins ( ago ) , and mirna serves as a template for recognizing specific mrna sequences animal mirnas are usually complementary to a site in the 3 ' utr whereas plant mirnas are usually complementary to coding regions of mrnas animal mirnas inhibit protein translation of the target mrna ( this is present but less common in plants ) mirnas occasionally also cause histone modification and dna methylation of promoter sites , which affects the expression of target genes however , genes involved in functions common to all cells , such as gene expression , have relatively fewer microrna target sites and seem to be under selection to avoid targeting by micrornas dsrna can also activate gene expression , a mechanism that has been termed '' small rna-induced gene activation '' or rnaa up to 35 different mirnas have been found to be altered in the alcoholic post-mortem brain , all of which target genes that include the regulation of the cell cycle , apoptosis , cell adhesion , neural development and cell signaling altered mirna levels were found in the medial prefrontal cortex of alcohol-dependent mice , suggesting the role of mirna in orchestrating translational imbalances and the creation of differentially expressed proteins within an area of the brain where complex cognitive behavior and decision making likely originate mirnas also play crucial roles in the regulation of complex enzymatic cascades including the hemostatic blood coagulation system viral micrornas play an important role in the regulation of gene expression of viral and/or host genes to benefit the virus large scale studies of functional mirna targeting suggest that many functional mirnas can be missed by target prediction algorithms .
