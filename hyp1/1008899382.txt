the oldest offshore well recorded in infield 's offshore database is the bibiheyb…ôt well which came on stream in 1923 in azerbaijan in the early 1930s , texaco developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf in 1937 , pure oil company ( now chevron corporation ) and its partner superior oil company ( now part of exxonmobil corporation ) used a fixed platform to develop a field in of water , one mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) offshore of calcasieu parish , louisiana in any case , that made kerr-mcgee 's well the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land when offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to , fixed platform rigs were built , until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the to depth of the gulf of mexico , the first jackup rig began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ensco international it was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small , and blue water drilling and shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in its floating mode since then , many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet these platforms are built on concrete or steel legs , or both , anchored directly onto the seabed , supporting the deck with space for drilling rigs , production facilities and crew quarters offshore concrete structure , pioneered by the condeep concept , often have in-built oil storage in tanks below the sea surface and these tanks were often used as a flotation capability , allowing them to be built close to shore ( norway fjords and scotland firths are popular because they are sheltered and deep enough ) and then floated to their final position where they are sunk to the seabed jack-up mobile drilling units ( or jack-ups ) , as the name suggests , are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered , much like jacks these modus ( mobile offshore drilling units ) are typically used in water depths up to , although some designs can go to depth it is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling these platforms are moored to a location for extended periods , and do not actually drill for oil or gas mini tlps can also be used as utility , satellite or early production platforms for larger deepwater discoveries steel gbs are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform , for example in the caspian sea it is mainly installed by pulling it off the yard , by either wet-tow or/and dry-tow , and self-installing by controlled ballasting of the compartments with sea water to position the gbs during installation , the gbs may be connected to either a transportation barge or any other barge ( provided it is large enough to support the gbs ) using strand jacks these installations , also known as satellite platforms , are small unmanned platforms consisting of little more than a well bay and a small process plant a typical oil production platform is self-sufficient in energy and water needs , housing electrical generation , water desalinators and all of the equipment necessary to process oil and gas such that it can be either delivered directly onshore by pipeline or to a floating platform or tanker loading facility , or both the following also are not names officially recognized in the industry : oim ( offshore installation manager ) who is the ultimate authority during his/her shift and makes the essential decisions regarding the operation of the platform ; operations team leader ( otl ) ; offshore methods engineer ( ome ) who defines the installation methodology of the platform ; offshore operations engineer ( ooe ) who is the senior technical authority on the platform ; pstl or operations coordinator for managing crew changes ; dynamic positioning operator , navigation , ship or vessel maneuvering ( modu ) , station keeping , fire and gas systems operations in the event of incident ; automation systems specialist , to configure , maintain and troubleshoot the process control systems ( pcs ) , process safety systems , emergency support systems and vessel management systems ; second mate to meet manning requirements of flag state , operates fast rescue craft , cargo operations , fire team leader ; third mate to meet manning requirements of flag state , operate fast rescue craft , cargo operations , fire team leader ; ballast control operator to operate fire and gas systems ; crane operators to operate the cranes for lifting cargo around the platform and between boats ; scaffolders to rig up scaffolding for when it is required for workers to work at height ; coxswains to maintain the lifeboats and manning them if necessary ; control room operators , especially fpso or production platforms ; catering crew , including people tasked with performing essential functions such as cooking , laundry and cleaning the accommodation ; production techs to run the production plant ; helicopter pilot ( s ) living on some platforms that have a helicopter based offshore and transporting workers to other platforms or to shore on crew changes ; maintenance technicians ( instrument , electrical or mechanical ) the accident greatly accelerated the practice of providing living accommodations on separate platforms , away from those used for extraction in the gulf of mexico and offshore california , the waters around oil platforms are popular destinations for sports and commercial fishermen , because of the greater numbers of fish near the platforms the united states and brunei have active rigs-to-reefs programs , in which former oil platforms are left in the sea , either in place or towed to new locations , as permanent artificial reefs on the us pacific coast , marine biologist milton love has proposed that oil platforms off california be retained as artificial reefs , instead of being dismantled ( at great cost ) , because he has found them to be havens for many of the species of fish which are otherwise declining in the region , in the course of 11 years of research produced water is also generated , which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas ; it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons the increasing number of oil rigs also increase movement of oil tankers which also increases co2 levels which directly warm water in the zone , warm waters are a key factor for hurricanes to form old oil rigs could become co2 storage sites ageing oil rigs could be used to store carbon and fight climate change others have been sea launch launches , and more are being redesigned for use with heavy-lift launch vehicles production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment , such as the troll a platform standing on a depth of 300 meters another type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location while a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform , the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities the trend today is to conduct more of the production operations subsea , by separating water from oil and re-injecting it rather than pumping it up to a platform , or by flowing to onshore , with no installations visible above the sea an offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria , sleeping quarters , management and other support functions supplies and waste are transported by ship , and the supply deliveries need to be carefully planned because storage space on the platform is limited subsea facilities are also easier to expand , with new separators or different modules for different oil types , and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above-water installation list of tallest oil platforms accommodation platform chukchi cap conductor support system deep sea mining deepwater drilling drillship north sea oil offshore geotechnical engineering offshore oil and gas in the united states oil drilling protocol for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of fixed platforms located on the continental shelf sar201 shallow water drilling submarine pipeline tempsc texas towers oil rig disasters listing of oil rig accidents oil rig photos collection of pictures of drilling rigs and production platforms an independent review of offshore platforms in the north sea overview of conventional platforms pictorial treatment on the installation of platforms which extend from the seabed to the ocean surface
