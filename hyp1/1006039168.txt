this period contains technetium , one of the two elements until lead that has no stable isotopes ( along with promethium ) , as well as molybdenum and iodine , two of the heaviest elements with a known biological role , and niobium has the largest magnetic known penetration depth of all the elements many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny for example , rubidium has 5 electron shells , a property found in all other period 5 elements , whereas its electron configuration 's ending is similar to all other alkali metals : s 1 rubidium also follows the trend of increasing reactivity as the atomic number increases in the alkali metals , for it is more reactive than potassium , but less so than caesium in addition , both potassium and rubidium yield almost the same hue when ignited , so researchers must use different methods to differentiate between these two 1st group elements it is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a '' rare earth element '' yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier , although minor amounts are used as alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion it is a soft , grey , ductile transition metal , which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral , the main commercial source for niobium , and columbite niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum , and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish niobium is used mostly in alloys , the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines in the last two applications , niobium 's low toxicity and ability to be colored by anodizing are particular advantages it readily forms hard , stable carbides , and for this reason it is often used in high-strength steel alloys molybdenum does not occur as a free metal on earth , but rather in various oxidation states in minerals it is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes ; every form of it is radioactive rhodium is a chemical element that is a rare , silvery-white , hard , and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal , alloyed with similar metals , and never as a chemical compound palladium plays a key role in the technology used for fuel cells , which combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity , heat , and water the metal occurs naturally in its pure , free form ( native silver ) , as an alloy with gold and other metals , and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite today , silver metal is also used in electrical contacts and conductors , in mirrors and in catalysis of chemical reactions its compounds are used in photographic film , and dilute silver nitrate solutions and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides cadmium is a chemical element with the symbol cd and atomic number 48 this soft , bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12 , zinc and mercury like zinc , it prefers oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds and like mercury it shows a low melting point compared to transition metals cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals , in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states indium is a chemical element with the symbol in and atomic number 49 this rare , very soft , malleable and easily fusible other metal is chemically similar to gallium and thallium , and shows the intermediate properties between these two indium was discovered in 1863 and named for the indigo blue line in its spectrum that was the first indication of its existence in zinc ores , as a new and unknown element zinc ores continue to be the primary source of indium , where it is found in compound form very rarely the element can be found as grains of native ( free ) metal , but these are not of commercial importance indium 's current primary application is to form transparent electrodes from indium tin oxide in liquid crystal displays and touchscreens , and this use largely determines its global mining production it is also used for making particularly low melting point alloys , and is a component in some lead-free solders in a similar way to aluminium salts , indium ( iii ) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection , but oral indium compounds do not have the chronic toxicity of salts of heavy metals , probably due to poor absorption in basic conditions radioactive indium-111 ( in very small amounts on a chemical basis ) is used in nuclear medicine tests , as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body tin shows chemical similarity to both neighboring group 14 elements , germanium and lead and has two possible oxidation states , +2 and the slightly more stable +4 antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used for cosmetics , metallic antimony was also known but mostly identified as lead its extreme rarity in the earth 's crust , comparable to that of platinum , is partly due to its high atomic number , but also due to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused the element to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet however , they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself , which is normally extracted as by-product of copper and lead production iodine 's relatively high atomic number , low toxicity , and ease of attachment to organic compounds have made it a part of many radiocontrast materials in modern medicine in the universe and on earth , iodine 's high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element although generally unreactive , xenon can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate , the first noble gas compound to be synthesized
