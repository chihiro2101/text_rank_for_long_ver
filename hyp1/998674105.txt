although , fundamentally , both western and japanese primatology share many of the same principles , the areas of their focus in primate research and their methods of obtaining data differ widely early primate study focused primarily on medical research , but some scientists also conducted '' civilizing '' experiments on chimpanzees in order to gauge both primate intelligence and the limits of their brainpower there are three methodological approaches in primatology : field study , the more realistic approach ; laboratory study , the more controlled approach ; and semi-free ranging , where primate habitat and wild social structure is replicated in a captive setting in semi-free ranging studies , scientists are able to watch how primates might act in the wild but have easier access to them , and the ability to control their environments all types of primate study in the western methodology are meant to be neutral early field primatology tended to focus on individual researchers long-term sites of research tend to be best associated with their founders , and this led to some tension between younger primatologists and the veterans in the field the japanese theory believes that studying primates will give us insight into the duality of human nature : individual self vs though kawai is the only japanese primatologist associated with the use of this term , the underlying principle is part of the foundation of japanese primate research japanese primatologists are renowned for their ability to recognise animals by sight , and indeed most primates in a research group are usually named and numbered comprehensive data on every single subject in a group is a uniquely japanese trait of primate research each member of the primate community has a part to play , and the japanese researchers are interested in this complex interaction a team of researchers may observe a group of primates for several years in order to gather very detailed demographic and social histories ) the meeting point of these two disciplines has become a nexus of discussion on key issues concerning the evolution of sociality , the development and purpose of language and deceit , and the development and propagation of culture additionally , this interface is of particular interest to the science watchers in science and technology studies , who examine the social conditions which incite , mould , and eventually react to scientific discoveries and knowledge robin dunbar suggests a link between primate grooming and the development of human language set into an evolutionary context , the dunbar number shows a drive for the development of a method of bonding that is less labor-intensive than grooming : language this view of language evolution covers the general biological trends needed for language development , but it takes another hypothesis to uncover the evolution of the cognitive processes necessary for language the contrary theory , of generalist mind , suggests that the brain is just a big computer that runs one program , the mind this test strongly suggests that human logic is based on a module originally developed in a social environment to root out cheaters , and that either the module is at a huge disadvantage where abstract thinking is involved , or that other less effective modules are used when faced with abstract logic a very recent study indicated that human babies and grown monkeys approach and process numbers in a similar fashion , suggesting an evolved set of da for mathematics ( jordan ) theory of mind asks whether or not an individual recognizes and can keep track of information asymmetry amongst individuals in the group , and whether or not they can attribute folk psychology to their peers his studies have shown that chimpanzees can recognize whether a researcher desires a dropped object , and act accordingly by picking it up in a related experiment , groups of chimps were given rope-pulling problems they could not solve individually this research is highly indicative of the ability of chimps to detect the folk psychological state of '' desire '' , as well as the ability to recognize that other individuals are better at certain tasks than they are however primates do not always fare so well in situations requiring theory of mind scientific studies concerning primate and human behavior have been subject to the same set of political and social complications , or biases , as every other scientific discipline current scientific practice , especially in the hard sciences , requires a total dissociation of personal experience from the finished scientific product ( bauchspies 8 ) data supporting the authors ' conclusion that cottontop tamarin monkeys displayed pattern-learning behavior similar to human infants reportedly could not be located after a three-year investigation because of the high number of women , schiebinger has even asserted that '' primatology is widely celebrated as a feminist science '' early research emphasized male-male competition for females '' the female point of view '' respect for nature and an ethic cooperation with nature move away from reductionism promote humanitarian values rather than national interests diverse community , accessible and egalitarian schiebinger suggests that only two out of the six features characteristic of feminism one of them is the discussion of the politics of participation and the attention placed on females as subjects of research in 1970 jeanne altmann drew attention to representative sampling methods in which all individuals , not just the dominant and the powerful , were observed for equal periods of time sarah hrdy , a self-identified feminist , was among the first to apply what became known as sociobiological theory to primates while some influential women challenged fundamental paradigms , schiebinger suggests that science is constituted by numerous factors varying from gender roles and domestic issues that surround race and class to economic relations between researchers from developed world countries and the developing world countries in which most nonhuman primates reside
