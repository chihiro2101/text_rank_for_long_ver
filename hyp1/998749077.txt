these writings reveal a conservative tendency that distinguished his later works — an unbounded respect for the earlier authorities nachmanides ' adherence to the words of the rishonim may be due to piety , or the influence of the northern french jewish school of thought however , it is thought that it also may be a reaction to the rapid acceptance of greek philosophy among the jews of spain and provence ; this occurred soon after the appearance of maimonides ' guide for the perplexed in a letter addressed to the french rabbis , he draws attention to the virtues of maimonides and holds that maimonides ' mishneh torah – his code of jewish law – not only shows no leniency in interpreting prohibitions within jewish law , but may even be seen as more stringent , which in nachmanides ' eyes was a positive factor ) '' if , '' he says , '' you were of the opinion that it was your duty to denounce the guide as heretical , why does a portion of your flock recede from the decision as if it regretted the step ? is it right in such important matters to act capriciously , to applaud the one to-day and the other tomorrow ? '' to reconcile the two parties , nachmanides proposed that the ban against the philosophical portion of maimonides 's code of jewish law should be revoked , but that the ban against the study of the guide for the perplexed , and against those who rejected allegorical interpretation of the bible , should be maintained and even strengthened the book iggeret ha-kodesh ( אגרת הקודש - the holy epistle ) on the topics of marriage , holiness , and sexual relations was commonly attributed to nachmanides , who supposedly wrote it for his son as a wedding gift in the view of the author , the body with all its functions being the work of god , is holy , and so none of its normal sexual impulses and actions can be regarded as objectionable for nachmanides , divine revelation is the best guide in all these questions , and proceeds to give his views on jewish eschatology the resurrection spoken of by the prophets , which will take place after the coming of the messiah , is referred by nachmanides to the body ramban 's commentary on the torah ( five books of moses ) was his last work , and his most well known he was prompted to record his commentary by three motives : ( 1 ) to satisfy the minds of students of the law and stimulate their interest by a critical examination of the text ; ( 2 ) to justify the ways of god and discover the hidden meanings of the words of scripture , '' for in the torah are hidden every wonder and every mystery , and in her treasures is sealed every beauty of wisdom '' ; ( 3 ) to soothe the minds of the students by simple explanations and pleasant words when they read the appointed sections of the pentateuch on sabbaths and festivals his commentary on the creation of the world describes the heavens and the earth being created out of a noncorporeal substance : as in his preceding works , he vehemently attacks the greek philosophy , especially aristotle , and frequently criticizes maimonides ' biblical interpretations 18:8 , in his '' ma'amar tehiyyat hametim '' ( '' treatise on resurrection '' ) , maimonides dismisses as '' utter fools '' anyone who believes that the three angels who visited abraham 's tent actually '' ate '' the '' curd , and milk , and the calf '' that abraham had prepared for them , despite the explicit language of the text asserting that maimonides ' preferred understanding is contrary to the evident meaning of the biblical words and that it is sinful even to hear it while maimonides endeavored to reduce the miracles of the bible to the level of nature , nachmanides emphasizes them , declaring that '' no man can share in the torah of our teacher moses unless he believes that all our affairs , whether they concern masses or individuals , are miraculously controlled , and that nothing can be attributed to nature or the order of the world this was the religious disputation in which he was called upon to defend his faith in 1263 relying upon the reserve his adversary would be forced to exercise due to fear of offending the feelings of the christians , pablo assured the king that he would prove the truth of christianity from the talmud and other rabbinical writings the subjects discussed were : whether the messiah had appeared ; whether the messiah announced by the prophets was to be considered as divine or as a man born of human parents whether the jews or the christians were in possession of the true faith christiani argued , based upon several aggadah passages , that the pharisee sages believed that the messiah had lived during the talmudic period , and that they ostensibly believed that the messiah was therefore jesus nachmanides argued that the biblical prophets regarded the future messiah as a human , a person of flesh and blood , and not as divine , in the way that christians view jesus he stated that their promises of a reign of universal peace and justice had not yet been fulfilled , that since the appearance of jesus , the world had been filled with violence and injustice , and that among all denominations the christians were the most warlike he noted that questions of the messiah were of less dogmatic importance to jews than most christians imagine the reason given by him for this bold statement was that it was more meritorious for the jews to observe the precepts under a christian ruler , while in exile and suffering humiliation and abuse , than under the rule of the messiah , when every one would perforce act in accordance with the law from this publication pablo selected certain passages which he construed as blasphemies against christianity and denounced to the head of his order , raymond of penyafort nachmanides admitted that he had stated many things against christianity , but he had written nothing which he had not used in his disputation in the presence of the king , who had granted him freedom of speech in another , addressed to his second son , who occupied an official position at the castilian court , nachmanides recommends the recitation of the daily prayers and warns above all against immorality
