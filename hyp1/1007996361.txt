– he seems reluctant to believe he is a pickpocket when mr brownlow sends oliver out to pay for some books , one of the gang , a young girl named nancy , whom oliver had previously met at fagin 's , accosts him with help from her abusive lover , the robber bill sikes , and oliver is quickly bundled back to fagin 's lair after being abandoned by sikes , the wounded oliver makes it back to the house and ends up under the care of the people he was supposed to rob : miss rose and her guardian mrs maylie monks is apparently related to oliver in some way after one such argument , mr bumble walks to a pub where he meets monks , who questions him about oliver after mrs bumble tells monks all she knows for a price , monks takes the locket and ring proving oliver 's parents , which had once belonged to oliver 's mother , and drops them into the river flowing under his place now ashamed of her role in oliver 's kidnapping and worried for the boy 's safety , nancy goes to rose maylie , staying in london she knows that monks and fagin are plotting to get their hands on the boy again , and offers to meet again any sunday night on london bridge fagin realizes that nancy is up to something , perhaps has a new boyfriend , and resolves to find out what her secret is using the name '' morris bolter '' , he joins fagin 's gang for protection and becomes a practicer of '' the kinchin lay '' ( robbing of children ) , and charlotte is put with the girls next , noah is sent by fagin to spy on nancy , and discovers her meeting with rose and mr brownlow on the bridge , hearing their discussion of why she did not appear the prior week and how to save oliver from fagin and monks she marries her sweetheart harry maylie , who gives up his political ambitions to become a parson , drawing all their friends to settle near them the novel ends with the tombstone of oliver 's mother on which it is written only one name : agnes oliver , an innocent child , is trapped in a world where his only options seem to be the workhouse , a life of crime symbolised by fagin 's gang , a prison , or an early grave in the midst of corruption and degradation , the essentially passive oliver remains pure-hearted ; he steers away from evil when those around him give in to it , and in proper fairy-tale fashion , he eventually receives his reward – leaving for a peaceful life in the country , surrounded by kind friends on the way to this happy ending , dickens explores the kind of life an outcast , orphan boy could expect to lead in 1830s london in an early chapter , oliver attends a pauper 's funeral with mr sowerberry and sees a whole family crowded together in one miserable room oliver owes his life several times over to kindness both large and small oliver , born for better things , struggles to survive in the savage world of the underclass before finally being rescued by his family and returned to his proper place—a commodious country house the 2005 film adaptation of oliver twist of the novel dispenses with the paradox of oliver 's genteel origins by eliminating his origin story completely , making him just another anonymous orphan like the rest of fagin 's gang the '' merry old gentleman '' fagin , for example , has satanic characteristics : he is a veteran corrupter of young boys who presides over his own corner of the criminal world ; he makes his first appearance standing over a fire holding a toasting-fork , and he refuses to pray on the night before his execution the novel is also concerned with social class , and the stark injustice in oliver 's world in addition , charley bates turns his back on crime when he sees the murderous cruelty of the man who has been held up to him as a model image : cruikshank - the last chance ( oliver twist ) however , oliver and his name may have been based on a young workhouse boy named peter tolliver whom dickens knew while growing up this is also illustrated when sikes dies and the dog immediately dies as well bull's-eye 's name also conjures up the image of nancy 's eyes , which haunt sikes until the bitter end and eventually cause him to hang himself accidentally dickens also juxtaposes honest , law-abiding characters such as oliver himself with those who , like the artful dodger , seem more comfortable on the wrong side of the law crime and punishment is another important pair of themes , as is sin and redemption : dickens describes criminal acts ranging from picking pockets to murder , and the characters are punished severely in the end neither character achieves redemption ; sikes dies trying to run away from his guilt , and on his last night alive , the terrified fagin refuses to see a rabbi or to pray , instead asking oliver to help him escape she is one of the few characters in oliver twist to display much ambivalence as one of fagin 's victims , corrupted but not yet morally dead , she gives eloquent voice to the horrors of the old man 's little criminal empire she wants to save oliver from a similar fate ; at the same time , she recoils from the idea of turning traitor , especially to bill sikes , whom she loves when he was later criticised for giving a '' thieving , whoring slut of the streets '' such an unaccountable reversal of character , dickens ascribed her change of heart to '' the last fair drop of water at the bottom of a dried-up , weed-choked well '' '' dickens ( who had extensive knowledge of london street life and child exploitation ) explained that he had made fagin jewish because '' it unfortunately was true , of the time to which the story refers , that that class of criminal almost invariably was a jew i always speak well of them , whether in public or private , and bear my testimony ( as i ought to do ) to their perfect good faith in such transactions as i have ever had with them '' eliza davis , whose husband had purchased dickens 's home in 1860 when he had put it up for sale , wrote to dickens in protest at his portrayal of fagin , arguing that he had '' encouraged a vile prejudice against the despised hebrew '' , and that he had done a great wrong to the jewish people while dickens first reacted defensively upon receiving davis 's letter , he then halted the printing of oliver twist , and changed the text for the parts of the book that had not been set , which explains why after the first 38 chapters fagin is barely called '' the jew '' at all in the next 179 references to him the story takes place in modern-day new york city , with oliver ( voiced by joey lawrence ) portrayed as an orphaned kitten , the dodger as a street-wise mongrel ( voiced by billy joel ) , and fagin ( voiced by dom deluise ) as a homeless bum who lives on the docks with his pack of stray dogs that he trains to steal so he can survive and repay his debt to loan shark sykes ( voiced by robert loggia ) saban 's adventures of oliver twist , a 52 episode animated american-french co-production that aired between 1996 and 1997 , where the story is downplayed for younger viewers , where oliver loses his mother in a crowd rather than being dead and the characters are represented by anthropomorphic animals
