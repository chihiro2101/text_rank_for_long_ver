even to say that god is all-knowing , all-powerful , and all-good is to introduce plurality , if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that god 's power is greater than ours , that god 's life is more permanent than ours , or that god 's knowledge is broader than ours maimonedes believed that statements such as '' god lives '' or '' god is powerful '' are nonsense if they are interpreted in the normal fashion , but they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations still , maimonedes also believed that negation is objectionable to the degree that it introduces complexity : god is neither this nor that , and ultimately any kind of verbal expression fails us god , as creator is by definition separate from the universe and thus free of any property ( and hence an absolute unity ) ; see negative theology on the other hand , it is understood that god 's essence contains every possible element of perfection : '' the first foundation is to believe in the existence of the creator , blessed be he in western christian classical theism , god is simple , not composite , not made up of thing upon thing thomas morris notes that divine simplicity can mean any or all of three different claims : god has no spatial parts ( spatial simplicity ) god is without the sort of metaphysical complexity where god would have different parts which are distinct from himself ( property simplicity ) in other words , property simplicity ( or metaphysical simplicity ) states that the characteristics of god are not parts of god that together make up god theologians holding the doctrine of property simplicity tend to distinguish various modes of the simple being of god by negating any notion of composition from the meaning of terms used to describe it thus , in quantitative or spatial terms , god is simple as opposed to being made up of pieces , present in entirety everywhere , if in fact present anywhere in terms of essences , god is simple as opposed to being made up of form and matter , or body and soul , or mind and act , and so on and so , in terms of subjects and accidents , as in the phrase '' goodness of god '' , divine simplicity allows that there is a conceptual distinction between the person of god and the personal attribute of goodness , but the doctrine disallows that god 's identity or '' character '' is dependent upon goodness , and at the same time the doctrine dictates that it is impossible to consider the goodness in which god participates separately from the goodness which god is furthermore , according to some kant , the critique of pure reason ? , as creatures our concepts are all drawn from the creation ( the assumption of empiricism ) ; it follows from this and divine simplicity that god 's attributes can only be spoken of by analogy , since it is not true of any created thing that its properties are identical to its being consequently , when christian scripture is interpreted according to the guide of divine simplicity , when it says that god is good for example , it should be taken to speak of a likeness to goodness as found in humanity and referred to in human speech first , he argues our concepts can apply univocally to god , even if our language to describe god is limited , fragmentary , halting , and inchoate if none of our concepts apply to god , then it is sheer confusion to say there is such a person as god , and yet god does not have properties such as wisdom , being the creator , and being almighty in fact , god would not have any properties for which we have concepts first , the thomist doctrine of simplicity states that all abstract objects are identical with god 's essence and hence god himself just as it seems there are characteristics that god has but could have lacked , it also seems the case that there are characteristics that god lacks but could have had on the doctrine of divine simplicity , god is absolutely similar in all possible worlds by postulating a distinction between existence and essence for all created beings , which was perceived to be uniquely absent in god , al-farabi established another model of divine simplicity avicenna supported and elaborated this position , al-ghazali contested this identification of divine essence and existence , but still saw all divine attributes and acts as enveloped in and indistinct from the divine essence , this latter view of divine simplicity was shared with some of the most trenchant critics of the muslim philosophical writers , like ibn taymiyyah '' making sense of divine simplicity '' , faith and philosophy 25 ( 1 ) ( 2008 ) : 3â€“30
