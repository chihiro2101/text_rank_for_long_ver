watkin 's father was closely involved in the anti-corn law league , and edward soon joined him , rising to become a key league organiser in manchester watkin began to show an interest in railways and in 1845 he took on the secretaryship of the trent valley railway , which was sold the following year to the london and north western railway ( lnwr ) , for Â£438,000 back in great britain he was appointed secretary of the worcester and hereford railway his grand vision was a transcontinental railway lying largely within canada , but owing to the sparse population west of lake superior , the scheme could not be profitable in the absence of government financial backing in 1866 he became a director of the great western railway and in january 1868 the great eastern railway he was instrumental in the creation of the ms & lr 's 'london extension ' , sheffield to marylebone , the great central main line , opened in 1899 for watkin , opening an independent route to london was crucial for the long-term survival and development of the ms & lr , but it was also one part of a grander scheme : a line from manchester to paris the great central railway 's main line to london was also built to a comparatively generous structure gauge , but contrary to popular belief it was not built to a 'continental ' gauge , not least because there were no agreed dimensions for such a gauge until the berne gauge convention was signed in 1912 the project was highly controversial and fears grew of the tunnel being used as a route for a possible french invasion of great britain ; notable opponents of the project were the war office scientific committee , lord wolseley and prince george , duke of cambridge ; queen victoria reportedly found the tunnel scheme '' objectionable '' watkin was skilled at public relations and attempted to garner political support for his project , inviting such high-profile guests as the prince and princess of wales , liberal party leader william gladstone and the archibald tait to submarine champagne receptions in the tunnel the park was served by wembley park station , which officially opened in the same month , though it had in fact been open on saturdays since october 1893 to cater for football matches in the pleasure gardens without watkin 's pleasure gardens and station it is unlikely that the british empire exhibition would have been held at wembley , which in turn would have prevented wembley becoming either synonymous with english football or a successful popular music venue without watkin , it is likely that the district would have simply become inter-war semi-detached suburbia like the rest of west london the foundations of the tower were laid in 1892 , the first stage was completed in september 1895 and it was opened to the public in 1896 watkin for his part insisted that he was a liberal , albeit one who had moved away from the official party their son , alfred mellor watkin , became locomotive superintendent of the south eastern railway in 1876 biographical details of managers , chairmen , etc and member of parliament for the great grimsby constituency in 1877
