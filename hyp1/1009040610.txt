although the saturday-morning timeslot had always featured a great deal of children 's television series beginning in the early 1950s , the idea of commissioning new animated series for broadcast on saturday mornings caught on in the mid-1960s , when the networks realized that they could concentrate kids ' viewing on that one morning to appeal to advertising while production times and costs were undeniably higher with animated programming , the cost of talent was far less ( voice actors became known for their ability to hold several characters at once , sometimes even on the same show ) and networks could rerun children 's animated programming more frequently than most live-action series , negating the financial disadvantages during the 1960s and 1970s , it was not uncommon to have animated shorts produced with both film and television in mind ( depatie-freleng was particularly associated with this business model ) , so that by selling the shorts to theaters , the studios could afford a higher budget than would otherwise be available from television alone , which at the time was still a free medium for the end-user the schoolhouse rock ! series on abc became a television classic ; abc also had several other short-form animated featurettes , including time for timer and the bod squad , that had long runs just as notable were cbs 's news segments for children , in the news and nbc 's ask nbc news and one to grow on , which featured skits of everyday problems with advice from the stars of nbc prime time programs the rise of cable television networks such as the disney channel , nickelodeon and cartoon network , which provided appealing animated entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours , making saturday-morning timeslots far less important to viewers and advertisers the increased availability of home video services ( both hard-copy and later through the internet in the form of video on demand ) , which , just like cable , allowed children to watch their favorite cartoons at any given time this almost always meant that the educational programming was placed during the saturday-morning cartoon block nbc abandoned its original saturday-morning cartoon lineup in 1992 , replacing it with a saturday-morning edition of today and adding an all live-action teen-oriented block , tnbc , which featured saved by the bell , california dreams and other teen sitcoms cartoons returned to the network in the fall of 2002 , after cable network discovery kids ( now discovery family ) won the rights to the timeslot in an auction , beating out other children 's television companies ( notably nickelodeon , which already programmed cbs 's saturday-morning block as nickelodeon on cbs ) prior to that , and particularly in the early 1990s , it was not uncommon for affiliates to preempt part or all of abc 's cartoon lineup with local programming fox carried little or no e/i programming , leaving the responsibility of scheduling the e/i shows to the affiliates themselves ( although the network did eventually add daily reruns of the magic school bus to meet the e/i mandates from 1998 to 2001 ) following the closure of its 4kids tv block in 2008 , fox would not carry any children 's programming at all for five years until the launch of xploration station several channels , while not offering original animated series , do air reruns of older saturday-morning cartoons in the 2010s , the channel 's focus shifted toward airing reruns of cancelled animated series from the 1990s and 2000s ( many of which were never intended for the saturday-morning programming block ) , and as of 2014 , all earlier cartoons are relegated to graveyard slots hub network owned the broadcast rights to rerun several of fox kids ' most popular programs ( this was a byproduct of former fox kids head margaret loesch working as head of the hub network at the time ) ; the majority of that programming was dropped or relegated to early morning time slots when loesch left the network and the channel was relaunched as discovery family in 2014 abc was bought by the walt disney company in 1996 , which began airing all disney-produced programming by 1997 and cancelled programs produced by companies other than disney ( with the notable exceptions of two shows the bugs bunny show , which continued to air until warner bros after being purchased by disney , abc 's saturday-morning cartoons became part of a block called abc kids before switching to a block of live-action and animated programs under the banner abc kids in 2002 at one point , abc kids had only two animated shows on its schedule , while the remainder of the lineup consisted of live-action entertainment shows by late 2008 , most shows that were part of the abc kids block ( except for power rangers ) were reruns of older episodes that originally aired a few years earlier ; this remained the case for the next three years , with no episodes added into rotation ( thus , for instance , the first season of hannah montana was still running on abc kids in constant repeats , even though several further seasons had aired on disney channel by the time the block ended ) this is the second time cbs has dropped animated children 's programming from its lineup ; the network had previously gone with an all-live-action programming lineup for the 1997–98 season when the e/i rules took effect , but reverted to animated programming the following season the 4kids-produced block , which by that point had become 4kids tv , ended its run on december 27 , 2008 , fox opted to drop children 's programming altogether rather than lease the block to another company , becoming the third broadcast network ( after ion television ( then known as pax tv , which discontinued its pax kids lineup in 2000 , before reviving children 's programming as i : independent television through the 2006 launch of qubo ) and upn ) to completely abandon children 's programming , and replaced 4kids tv with a two-hour infomercial block called weekend marketplace ; as with 4kids tv and its predecessors , fox has allowed several stations the option to decline to carry the block and lease it to another station in the market , especially those stations which had never carried fox kids following the 1994–1996 united states broadcast television realignment resulting from fox 's 1994 affiliation agreement with new world pictures during the run of the weekday morning blocks , the network aired the animated series histeria ! to meet regulations on children 's television programming in the united states content quotas for the network 's affiliates the kids ' wb block ended its run on may 17 , 2008 , and was replaced on may 24 , 2008 by the 4kids entertainment-produced toonzai ( 4kids already produced fox 's 4kids tv block at that time , which would not end for another seven months due to a dispute with the network over distribution on fox stations and compensation for the time lease ) nbc kids , which was the only and final saturday-morning programming block to air animated programming , ended its run on september 25 , 2016 on february 24 , 2016 , nbc announced a new e/i block produced by litton entertainment , the more you know—a brand extension of nbc 's public service announcement brand '' the more you know '' , and it launched on october 8 , 2016 , resulting in nbc removing all cartoons from its saturday-morning lineups for the first time since september 1992 the block featured mainly scripted animated and live action series ; cookie jar-produced programs that did not count towards regulations on children 's television programming in the united states quotas aired under the sub-block this is for kids cookie jar toons/this is for kids was discontinued on october 31 , 2013 , effectively removing saturday children 's programming from the network ; after tribune broadcasting assumed part-ownership of thistv from weigel broadcasting the following day , tribune replaced the block with a three-hour sunday morning lineup of exclusively e/i-compliant programs from various syndication distributors on may 2 , 2017 , sinclair broadcast group announced that it would introduce a new children 's programming block named kidsclick , which airs on mainly cw and mynetworktv affiliates , and nationally on this tv , beginning on july 1 , 2017 on september 6 , 1999 , the block was rebranded as '' pbs kids '' and spun off into a 24-hour cable channel using the same name , which was turned into a joint venture with comcast , hit entertainment , and sesame workshop in 2005 , called pbs kids sprout , which later became simply sprout due to comcast buying full ownership of the network via nbcuniversal , eventually becoming universal kids in 2017 an additional three-hour weekend morning block for preschool-aged children that was produced in conjunction with the canada-based animation studio nelvana called the pbs kids bookworm bunch debuted in september 30 , 2000 and ended in 2004 telexitos airs both cartoons and three-hour children 's programming ;
