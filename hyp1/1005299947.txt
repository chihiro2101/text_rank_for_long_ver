the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state commenter lucian pye has argued that the modern '' nation state '' is fundamentally different from a traditional empire , and argues that dynamics of the current people 's republic of china ( prc ) – a concentration of power at a central point of authority – share an essential similarity with the ming and qing empires chinese nationalism as it emerged in the early 20th century was based on the experience of european nationalism , especially as viewed and interpreted by sun yat-sen chinese nationalism was rooted in the long historic tradition of china as the center of the world , in which all other states were offshoots and owed some sort of deference over the first half of the twentieth century , chinese nationalism has constituted a crucial part of many political ideologies , including the anti-manchuism during 1911 revolution , the anti-imperialism sentiment of the may fourth movement in 1919 , and the maoist thoughts that guided the communist revolution in 1949 shaped by the global discourse of social darwinism , reformers and intellectuals debated how to build a new chinese national subject based on a proper racial order , particularly the man-han relations after the collapse of the qing regime and the founding of the republic of china in 1911 , concerns of both domestic and international threat made the role of racism decline , while anti-imperialism became the new dominant ideology of chinese nationalism over the 1910s while intellectuals and elites advocated their distinctive thoughts on chinese nationalism , political scientist chalmers johnson has pointed out that most of these ideas had very little to do with china 's majority population -- the chinese peasantry johnson contends that early nationalism of the kuomintang was quite similar to the late nineteenth-century nationalism in europe , as both referred to the search for their national identities and positions in the modern world by the intelligentsia in the 1990s , rising economic standards , the dissolution of soviet union , and the lack of any other legitimizing ideology has led to what most observers see as a resurgence of nationalism within mainland china the main method by which they accomplished control of the chinese heartland was by portraying themselves as enlightened confucian sages part of whose goal was to preserve and advance chinese civilization it was during this time that the concept of han chinese came into existence as a means of describing the majority of chinese ethnicity due to sinicization in early chinese history the official chinese nationalistic view in the 1920s and 1930s was heavily influenced by modernism and social darwinism , and included advocacy of the cultural assimilation of ethnic groups in the western and central provinces into the '' culturally advanced '' han state , to become in name as well as in fact members of the chinese nation over the next decades , chinese nationalism was influenced strongly by russian ethnographic thinking , and the official ideology of the prc asserts that china is a multi-ethnic state , and han chinese , despite being the overwhelming majority ( over 95 % in the mainland ) , they are only one of many ethnic groups of china , each of whose culture and language should be respected however , many critics argue that despite this official view , assimilationist attitudes remain deeply entrenched , and popular views and actual power relationships create a situation in which chinese nationalism has in practice meant han dominance of minority areas and peoples and assimilation of those groups chinese muslims have played an important role in chinese nationalism chinese muslim students returning from study abroad , from places such as al-azhar university in egypt , learned about nationalism and advocated chinese nationalism at home chinese muslims believed that their '' watan '' was the whole of the republic of china , non-muslims included ma bufang , a chinese muslim general who was part of the kuomintang , supported chinese nationalism and tolerance between the different chinese ethnic groups he presented himself as a chinese nationalist to his advantage to keep himself in power as noted by the author erden islam was barely mentioned or used in politics or life except as a vague spiritual focus for unified opposition against the soviet union one unified common goal of current chinese nationalists is the unification of mainland china and taiwan while this was the commonly stated goal of both the people 's republic of china and the republic of china ( roc ) especially before 1991 , both sides differed sharply in the form of unification due to obvious and salient differences in political ideology despite this , the relationship between chinese nationalism and taiwan remains controversial , involving symbolic issues such as the use of '' the republic of china '' as the official name of the government on taiwan and the use of the word '' china '' in the name of government-owned corporations ( e.g the argument against unification is partly over culture and whether the taiwanese people should see themselves as chinese or taiwanese ; and partly over mistrust of the ruling chinese communist party ( ccp ) , such as its de-democratizing actions in hong kong ( e.g these misgivings are particularly prevalent amongst younger generations of taiwanese , who generally view both the ccp and the kmt as obsolete and consider themselves to have little connection to china except for ancestral cultural roots after the end of world war ii , overseas chinese were encouraged or sometimes coerced to regard themselves as citizens of their adopted nations rather than as part of the wider ethnic chinese nationality as a result , ethnic chinese in regional countries such as malaysia , singapore and thailand , as well as in the western world such as australia , canada and the united states were sharply divided over the concept of ethnic chinese from the concept of '' political chinese '' during the 1960s , the people 's republic of china ( prc ) and republic of china ( roc ) maintained different attitudes toward overseas chinese initially , the prc government viewed overseas chinese as capitalist agents ; in addition , the prc government also thought that maintaining good relations with southeast asian governments was more important than maintaining the support of overseas chinese with opening of china under deng xiaoping and the death of mao zedong , the prc 's attitude toward overseas chinese became much more favourable , and overseas chinese were seen as a source of capital and expertise in the 1990s , the prc 's efforts toward overseas chinese became mostly focused on maintaining the loyalty of '' chinese emigration '' , which consisted of mostly graduate students having moved , either temporarily or permanently in recent years , there have been summer camps which have been set up by organizations such as the china institute and confucius institute in which overseas chinese youths may attend to learn first-hand about its own ancestral chinese culture as well as the language in addition to the taiwan independence movement , hong kong independence and japanese nationalism , there are a number of ideologies which exist in opposition or are hostile to chinese nationalism some critics states that chinese nationalism is '' inherently backward '' such as nationalism in every country and is therefore incompatible with a modern state some even claim that chinese nationalism is actually a manifestation of beliefs in han chinese ethnic superiority ( also known as sinocentrism ) , though this is hotly debated while opponents have argued that reactionary nationalism is inherently unnecessary for a powerful nation , chinese nationalists assert that chinese nationalism was in many ways a result of western imperialism and is fundamental to the founding and stability of a modern chinese state furthermore , certain uyoku dantai are anti-chinese , to the extent which includes nanjing massacre denial or suppressing unit 731 , and nationalists say that a certain national consciousness is needed to defend or prevent such events from happening in china or against chinese people again edward friedman has argued that there is a northern governmental , political , bureaucratic chinese nationalism that is at odds with a southern , commercial chinese nationalism this division is rejected by most chinese and many non-chinese scholars , who believe that friedman has overstated the differences between the north and the south , and point out that the divisions within chinese society do not fall neatly into '' north-south '' divisions during the 1990s , chinese intellectuals have vigorously debated the political meaning and significance of the rising nationalism in china from their debates has emerged a multifarious populism nationalism which argues that anti-imperialist nationalism in china has provided a valuable public space for popular participation outside the country 's political institutions and that nationalist sentiments under the postcolonial condition represent a democratic form of civic activity it began to take recognizable shape after 1996 , as a joint result of the evolving nationalist thinking of the early 1990s and the ongoing debates on modernity , postmodernism , postcolonialism , and their political implications-debates that have engaged many chinese intellectuals since early 1995 one remarkable phenomenon in the post-cold war upsurge of chinese nationalism is that chinese intellectuals became one of the driving forces as an indication of the popular and intellectual origins of recent chinese nationalist sentiment , all coauthors of china can say no , the first in a string of defiant rebuttals to american imperialism , are college educated , and most are self-employed ( a freelancer , a fruit-stand owner , a poet , and journalists working in the partly market-driven field of chinese newspapers , periodicals , and television stations ) chinese nationalism targets against two major groups : japan , which second sino-japanese war , and secessionism like tibetan independence , xinjiang independence , taiwanese independence , hong kong independence , occasionally mongolian independence , and their supporters like us and india in the 21st century , notable spurs of grassroots chinese nationalism grew from what the chinese saw as the marginalization of their country from japan and the western world because the 2008 summer olympics were a major source of national pride , anti-olympics sentiments are often seen as anti-chinese sentiments inside china since the state-controlled media has control over most media outlets , the internet is one of the rare places where chinese nationalists can freely express their feelings as xi jinping became the general secretary of the chinese communist party that solidified his control after 2012 , the ccp has used the phrase '' chinese dream '' , to describe his overarching plans for china in the public media , the china dream and nationalism are interwoven in diplomacy , the chinese dream and nationalism have been closely linked to the belt and road initiative '' talent , virtue and nation : chinese nationalism and female
