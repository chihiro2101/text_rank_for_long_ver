using only us 30,000 in capital , atmel was initially operated as a fabless company , using sanyo and general instrument to make the chip wafers fundinguniverse.com , '' atmel corporation history '' the first atmel memory products used less power than competitors about.com , '' atmel corporation '' rather than fight the patent claim , atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property in addition , atmel then entered the flash memory business that intel had focused on in 1995 , atmel was among the first companies to license the arm architecture , creating initially its at91 family of devices , followed by the sam family , and more recently a full selection of cortex-based solutions , including ones based on the ultra-low-power arm cortex-m4 atmel completed the sale of their secure microcontroller solutions smart card business to inside secure in february 2011 , atmel sold its digital research in electronics , acoustics and music ( dream ) business , which sold products for karaoke and other entertainment machines , for us 2.3 million atmel 's dataflash serial interface flash memory products were sold to adesto technologies in october 2012 '' atmel completes acquisition of quantum research group '' work done at quantum , led to the 2012 release of atmel 's xsense product line , a flexible touch screen based on copper mesh electrodes they completed the acquisition of advanced digital design s.a , a spanish company that develops power line communication ozmo devices , which developed products for wi-fi direct , was acquired by atmel in december 2012 atmel purchased the smart metering product lines of idt corporation in march 2013 microchip to boost 8bit avr range following acquisition what â€™ s the deal with atmel and microchip ? in addition atmel still makes microcontrollers that use the 8051 architecture , albeit improved to do single-cycle instructions they also provide an atmel software framework to support the application of its touch controller chips , atmel provides a free qtouch library of software routines atmel 's original business was in memory , and it still sells several memory products these ics are used in many applications , including secure access , communications , control , and to prevent cloned products like batteries or ink cartridges not approved by the product manufacturer finally atmel offers a trusted platform module that gives strong hardware-based public key ( rsa algorithm ) security for both personal computers and embedded processors on a single chip the company also makes power management and analog companions ( pmaac ) that combine a group of discrete ics often used in handheld or battery-powered products products include fpgas , products with military and aerospace applications , and application-specific standard products ( assp ) for space applications , power management , and secure cryptographic memory products atmel also has chips specialized for the smart energy and smart metering markets
