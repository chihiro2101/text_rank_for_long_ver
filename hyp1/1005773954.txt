the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the radio antenna along with the rest of the instrument was built by nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory with international contributions by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) , among others the consert experiment provided information about the deep interior of the comet using radar this allowed it to determine the comet 's internal structure and deduce information on its composition rsi made use of the probe 's communication system for physical investigation of the nucleus and the inner coma of the comet giada analysed the dust environment of the comet coma by measuring the optical cross section , momentum , speed and mass of each grain entering inside the instrument comets are thought to have delivered a vast quantity of water to earth , and they may have also seeded earth with organic molecules the supernova could wipe out one type of molecules while also flinging the other surviving molecules into space , where they could eventually end up on a planet the mission has yielded a significant science return , collecting a wealth of data from the nucleus and its environment at various levels of cometary activity the virtis spectrometer on board the rosetta spacecraft has provided evidence of nonvolatile organic macromolecular compounds everywhere on the surface of comet 67p with little to no water ice visible measurements by the cosac and ptolemy instruments on the philae lander revealed sixteen organic compounds , four of which were seen for the first time on a comet , including acetamide , acetone , methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde one of the most outstanding discoveries of the mission was the detection of large amounts of free molecular oxygen gas surrounding the comet ; 2005 4 march – rosetta executed its first planned close swing-by ( gravity assist passage ) of earth the moon and the earth 's magnetic field were used to test and calibrate the instruments on board of the spacecraft 4 july – imaging instruments on board observed the collision between the comet tempel 1 and the impactor of the deep impact mission together with observations by hubble space telescope it could be confirmed that p/2010 & nbsp ; a2 is not a comet , but an asteroid , and that the tail most likely consists of particles from an impact by a smaller asteroid ; 2014 may to july – starting on 7 may , rosetta began orbital correction manoeuvres to bring itself into orbit around 67p 14 july – the osiris on-board imaging system returned images of comet 67p which confirmed the irregular shape of the comet 4 september – the first science data from rosetta alice instrument was reported , showing that the comet is unusually dark in ultraviolet wavelengths , hydrogen and oxygen are present in the coma , and no significant areas of water-ice have been found on the comet 's surface 10 december 2014 – data from the rosina mass spectrometers show that the ratio of heavy water to normal water on comet 67p is more than three times that on earth the ratio is regarded as a distinctive signature , and the discovery means that earth 's water is unlikely to have originated from comets like 67p ; 2015 14 april 2015 – scientists report that the comet 's nucleus has no magnetic field of its own 28 october 2015 – scientists publish an article in nature reporting high levels of dioxygen around 67p although philae sent back some data during its descent , rosetta has more powerful and more varied sensors and instruments , offering the opportunity to get some very close-in science to complement the more distant remote sensing it has been doing the script for each episode of the series is written by science communicators at the european space research and technology centre , who kept close with mission operators and the producers at design & data to promote the spacecraft 's arrival at comet 67p/churyumov–gerasimenko and the landing of philae in 2014 , a short film was produced by the european space agency with polish visual effects production company platige image
