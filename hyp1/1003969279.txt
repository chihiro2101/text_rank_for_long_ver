' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people throughout his career , lewin was focused on how the study of group dynamics could be applied to real-world , social issues also , a combination of evolution and game theory has been used to explain the development and maintenance of cooperative behavior between individuals in a group he coined the term group dynamics to describe the way groups and individuals act and react to changing circumstances he discovered several mass group processes which involved the group as a whole adopting an orientation which , in his opinion , interfered with the ability of a group to accomplish the work it was nominally engaged in tuckman 's model states that the ideal group decision-making process should occur in four stages : forming ( pretending to get on or get along with others ) storming ( letting down the politeness barrier and trying to get down to the issues even if tempers flare up ) norming ( getting used to each other and developing trust and productivity ) performing ( working in a group to a common goal on a highly efficient and cooperative basis ) tuckman later added a fifth stage for the dissolution of a group called adjourning this model refers to the overall pattern of the group , but of course individuals within a group work in different ways peck describes the stages of a community as : pseudo-community chaos emptiness true community communities may be distinguished from other types of groups , in peck 's view , by the need for members to eliminate barriers to communication in order to be able to form true community hackman suggested that groups are successful when they satisfy internal and external clients , develop capabilities to perform in the future , and when members find meaning and satisfaction in the group enabling structure : which results from having tasks which have variety , a group size that is not too large , talented group members who have at least moderate social skill , and strong norms that specify appropriate behaviour expert coaching : which occurs on the rare occasions when group members feel they need help with task or interpersonal issues intragroup dynamics ( also referred to as ingroup- , within-group , or commonly just ‘ group dynamics ’ ) are the underlying processes that give rise to a set of norms , roles , relations , and common goals that characterize a particular social group in many fields of research , there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour , attitudes , and opinions the dynamics of a particular group depend on how one defines the boundaries of the group notably , on this very broad level , the study of group dynamics is similar to the study of culture additionally , from the social identity approach , group formation involves both identifying with some individuals and explicitly not identifying with others yet , these groups still express high levels of interdependence and coordinate knowledge , resources , and tasks joining a group is determined by a number of different factors , including an individual 's personal traits ; gender ; social motives such as need for affiliation , need for power , and need for intimacy ; attachment style ; and prior group experiences groups can offer some advantages to its members that would not be possible if an individual decided to remain alone , including gaining social support in the forms of emotional support , instrumental support , and informational support however , joining a group may also cost an individual time , effort , and personal resources as they may conform to social pressures and strive to reap the benefits that may be offered by the group in john thibaut and harold kelley 's social exchange theory , comparison level is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the desirability of becoming a member of the group and forming new social relationships within the group this comparison level is influenced by previous relationships and membership in different groups according to the social exchange theory , group membership will be more satisfying to a new prospective member if the group 's outcomes , in terms of costs and rewards , are above the individual 's comparison level as well , group membership will be unsatisfying to a new member if the outcomes are below the individual 's comparison level comparison level only predicts how satisfied a new member will be with the social relationships within the group this comparison level for alternatives is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the quality of the group in comparison to other groups the individual has the opportunity to join ” joining and leaving groups is ultimately dependent on the comparison level for alternatives , whereas member satisfaction within a group depends on the comparison level past research has identified four basic types of groups which include , but are not limited to : primary groups , social groups , collective groups , and categories it is important to define these four types of groups because they are intuitive to most lay people for example , in an experiment , participants were asked to sort a number of groups into categories based on their own criteria individuals that are a part of primary groups consider the group to be an important part of their lives cooley believed that primary groups were essential for integrating individuals into their society since this is often their first experience with a group individuals can be born into a primary group ; however , primary groups can also form when individuals interact for extended periods of time in meaningful ways for this reason , categories can appear to be higher in entitativity and essentialism than primary , social , and collective groups the degree of entitativity that a group has is influenced by whether a collection of individuals experience the same fate , display similarities , and are close in proximity if individuals believe that a group is high in entitativity , then they are likely to believe that the group has unchanging characteristics that are essential to the group , known as essentialism in contrast , one 's social identity is defined by his or her group membership , and the general characteristics ( or prototypes ) that define the group and differentiate it from others in the social sciences , group cohesion refers to the processes that keep members of a social group connected it is thought to be one of the most important characteristics of a group , and has been linked to group performance , group conflict and therapeutic change later , this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group , termed attraction to the group whereas new members of a group must prove themselves to the full members to become accepted , full members have undergone socialization and are already accepted within the group results showed that the new members judged themselves as consistent with the stereotypes of their in-groups , even when they had recently committed to join those groups or existed as marginal members they also tended to judge the group as a whole in an increasingly less positive manner after they became full members nevertheless , depending on the self-esteem of an individual , members of the in-group may experience different private beliefs about the group 's activities but will publicly express the opposite—that they actually share these beliefs for example , studies have found that individuals work harder and faster when others are present ( see social facilitation ) , and that an individual 's performance is reduced when others in the situation create distraction or conflict this type of influence is often useful in the context of work settings , team sports , and political activism frequently studied elements of group structure include roles , norms , values , communication patterns , and status differentials group structure has also been defined as the underlying pattern of roles , norms , and networks of relations among members that define and organize the group a group with a high level of role differentiation would be categorized as having many different roles that are specialized and narrowly defined they are a fundamental aspect of group structure as they provide direction and motivation , and organize the social interactions of members norms are said to be emergent , as they develop gradually throughout interactions between group members while many norms are widespread throughout society , groups may develop their own norms that members must learn when they join the group clapping after a speech ) injunctive norms : describe behaviours that people ought to do ; more evaluative in nature than a descriptive norm intermember relations are the connections among the members of a group , or the social network within a group examining the intermember relations of a group can highlight a group 's density ( how many members are linked to one another ) , or the degree centrality of members ( number of ties between members ) analysing the intermember relations aspect of a group can highlight the degree centrality of each member in the group , which can lead to a better understanding of the roles of certain group ( e.g status differentials may affect the relative amount of pay among group members and they may also affect the group 's tolerance to violation of group norms ( e.g this dynamogenic factor is believed to have laid the groundwork for what is now known as social facilitation—an '' improvement in task performance that occurs when people work in the presence of other people '' if social facilitation occurs , the task will have required a dominant response from the individual resulting in better performance in the presence of others , whereas if social interference occurs the task will have elicited a nondominant response from the individual resulting in subpar performance of the task distraction-conflict theory contends that when a person is working in the presence of other people , an interference effect occurs splitting the individual 's attention between the task and the other person it predicts that self-confident individuals with a positive outlook will show performance gains through social facilitation , whereas a self-conscious individual approaching social situations with apprehension is less likely to perform well due to social interference effects this includes perceptions , attitudes , opinions , and behaviours towards one 's own group , as well as those towards another group despite strong evidence for the effectiveness of the jigsaw classroom , the strategy was not widely used ( arguably because of strong attitudes existing outside of the schools , which still resisted the notion that racial and ethnic minority groups are equal to whites and , similarly , should be integrated into schools )
