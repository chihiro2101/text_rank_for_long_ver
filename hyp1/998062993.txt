wetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water , or frequently doused with heavy spray , often approaching from near-horizontal directions , where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out the elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes , but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety together , these features greatly reduce the amount of water moving through the suit as the wearer moves in the water though more expensive and more difficult to take on and off than a wetsuit ( in most cases , a helper will be needed to close the dry-zip , which is usually located across the shoulders ) , semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits , and in the case of scuba diving , require no additional skills to use hot water suits are a loose fit as there is a constant supply of heated water piped into the suit which must escape to allow even flow distribution in this case , the water would quickly reach skin temperature and the air in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way in the popular mind , the layer of water between skin and suit has been credited with providing the insulation , but bradner clearly understood that the suit did not need to be wet because it was not the water that provided the insulation but rather the gas in the suit fabric as early as july 1951 , spearfishing in australia were experimenting with a natural rubber wetsuit '' of a 'wrap on ' variety , which does not set out to be 100 % waterproof ( but it is claimed that ) the leakage of water through it is so slow that body warmth under it is maintained for hours backing materials first arrived in the form of nylon cloth applied to one side of the neoprene this allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the nylon took most of the stress of pulling on the suit , but the suit still had the bare foam exposed on the outside and the nylon was relatively stiff , limiting flexibility a small strip reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck , wrists , and ankles in a rubber wetsuit this does not work well for a number of reasons , the main one being that punching holes straight through both layers of foam for the thread opens up passages for water to flow in and out of the suit this meant that a wetsuit could be very cold all along the seams of the suit and although the sewn edge did hold the two pieces together , it could also act as a perforated tear edge , making the suit easier to tear along the seams when putting it on and taking it off with this technology , the suit could be sewn and then taped , and the tape would cover the sewing holes as well as providing some extra strength to prevent tearing along the needle holes this created a smooth , flat surface that did not necessarily need taping , but unfortunately , raw foam glued to foam is not a strong bond and still prone to tearing blindstitch seams also lay flat , butting up the edge of one sheet against another , allowing the material to lay flatter and closer to the skin incorporating lycra into the backing permits a large amount of stretching that does not damage the suit , and allowed suits to become closer fitting for example , a thin strip of single-backed wrapped around the leg , neck , and wrist openings of the suit creates a seal that greatly reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit as the person 's body moves but since the strip is very narrow , it does not drag on the skin of the wearer and thus makes the suit easy to put on and remove the strip can also be fitted with the smooth side out and folded under to form a seal with a small length of smooth surface against the skin additionally , the animal skin 's looser fit allowed for the use of a supplemental vest in extreme conditions precision computer-controlled cutting and assembly methods , such as water jet cutter , have allowed ever greater levels of seam precision , permitting designers to use many small individual strips of different colors while still keeping the suit free of bulging and ripples from improper cutting and sewing although double-backed neoprene is strong , the cloth surface is relatively rough and creates a large amount of drag in the water , slowing down the swimmer to achieve flexibility and low bulk for a given warmth of suit , they are unlined inside , and the slightly porous raw surface of the neoprene adheres closely to the skin and reduces flushing of the suit extremely thin 1 & nbsp ; mm neoprene is also often used in the under-arm area , to decrease stretch resistance and reduce strain on the swimmer when they extend their arms out over their head these are not usually intended to be worn alone , but as an extra layer over or under a longer wetsuit some suits are arranged in two parts ; the jacket and long johns can be worn separately in mild conditions or worn together to provide two layers of insulation around the torso in cold conditions because wetsuits offer significant protection from jellyfish , coral , sunburn and other hazards , many divers opt to wear a thin suit which provides minimal insulation ( often called a '' bodysuit '' ) even when the water is warm enough to comfortably forego insulating garments some suits have extra layers added for key areas such as the lower back in the early days of wetsuits this was often a diamond pattern or similar , but can also be slick and smooth for low drag and quick drying the cut surfaces of the foam have a slightly porous mat finish as the cutting process passes through a large number of bubbles , leaving what is called an open cell surface finish , but the bulk of the foam remains closed cell it is relatively form fitting and comfortable on the skin , but the porosity encourages bacterial growth if not well washed after use , and the foam surface does not slide freely against skin the cut surfaces are usually bonded to a nylon knit fabric , which provides much greater tear resistance , at the expense of some loss of flexibility zippers are often used for closure or for providing a close fit at the wrists and ankles , but they also provide leakage points for water cross shoulder zipper can be made relatively watertight as it has no free ends , and is therefore used in semi-dry wetsuits they are relatively comfortable for most applications , the suit is easy to remove , and they place the zipper directly over the spine , which though flexible in bending , does not change much in length gaps where the suit does not touch the skin will vary in volume as the diver moves and this is a major cause of flushing custom fitted suits are produced by many manufacturers to provide a better fit for people for whom a well fitting off-the shelf suit is not available usually a wetsuit has no covering for the feet , hands or head , and the diver must wear separate neoprene boots , gloves and hood for additional insulation and environmental protection other accessories to the basic suit include pockets for holding small items and equipment , and knee-pads , to protect the knee area from abrasion and tearing , usually used by working divers using hoods : in the human body temperature , the heat loss over the head is at least 20 % of the whole balance flushing in the neck area can be reduced by using a hood attached to the top part of the suit , or by having sufficient overlap between the hood and the top part of the suit to constrain flow between the two parts where boots are worn with a wetsuit they are usually tucked under the leg of the suit for streamlining , to help hold the zip closed , and to keep foreign objects out typically , this is a solid rubber compound that is thicker and tougher than the neoprene used for the upper part of the bootee but is still flexible divers wearing bootees use fins with a foot part larger than needed with bare feet short-cut boots are frequently used in warmer conditions where the boots help give grip and foot protection while launching and portaging some divers cut the fingertips of the gloves off on the fingers most used for delicate work like operating the controls on a camera housing for cold water use , thicker mittens with a single space for the middle , ring and fifth fingers are available and can provide more warmth at the cost of reducing dexterity this could nearly double for a large person wearing a farmer-john and jacket for cold water
