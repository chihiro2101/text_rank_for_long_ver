in general terms , the procedure for an open appendectomy is : antibiotics are given immediately if signs of actual sepsis are seen ( in appendicitis , sepsis and bacteremia usually only occurs at some point after rupture , once peritonitis has begun ) , or if there is reasonable suspicion that the appendix has ruptured ( e.g , on imaging ) or if the onset of peritonitis- which will lead to full sepsis if not quickly treated- is suspected ; otherwise , a single dose of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics is given immediately before surgery as the two run at right angles to each other , this reduces the risk of later incisional hernia these incisions are placed for appendectomy : mcburney 's incision , also known as grid iron incision lanz incision rutherford morison incision paramedian incision over the past decade , the outcomes of laparoscopic appendectomies have compared favorably to those for open appendectomies because of decreased pain , fewer postoperative complications , shorter hospitalization , earlier mobilization , earlier return to work , and better cosmesis ; however , despite these advantages , efforts are still being made to decrease abdominal incision and visible scars after laparoscopy recent research has led to the development of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery ( notes ) ; however , numerous difficulties need to be overcome before a wider clinical application of notes is adopted , including complications such as the opening of hollow viscera , failed sutures , a lack of fully developed instrumentation , and the necessity of reliable cost-benefit analyses additionally , reports in the literature indicate that minilaparoscopic appendectomy using 2â€“ or 3-mm or even smaller instruments along with one 12-mm port minimizes pain and improves cosmesis also , a trend is increasing towards single-incision laparoscopic surgery ( sils ) , using a special multiport umbilical trocar there is a natural elevation in white blood cell count in addition to anatomical changes of the appendix that occur during pregnancy overall , there is no increased risk of fetal loss or preterm delivery with the laparoscopic approach ( la ) as compared to the open approach ( oa ) however , the la was associated with shorter length of stay in the hospital as well as reduced risk of wound infection thumb thumb a study from 2010 found that the average hospital stay for people with appendicitis in the united states was 1.8 days one of the most common post-operative complications associated with an appendectomy is the development of a surgical site infection ( ssi ) placement of an abdominal drain was originally thought to reduce the risk of these post-operative complications however , abdominal drains have not been found to play a significant role in reducing ssis and have lead to increased length of stay in the hospital in addition to increased cost of the operation in 1889 in new york city , charles mcburney described the presentation and pathogenesis of appendicitis accurately and developed the teaching that an early appendectomy was the best treatment to avoid perforation and peritonitis on september 13 , 1980 , kurt semm performed the first laparoscopic appendectomy opening up the path for a much wider application of minimally invasive surgery while appendectomy is a standard surgical procedure , its cost has been found to vary considerably in the united states
