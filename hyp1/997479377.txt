when the lunar phase is new as viewed from earth , earth would appear nearly fully sunlit from the moon earthshine is used to help determine the current albedo of earth thus , the part of earth where it is daytime and from where the moon is visible determines how bright the earthshine on the moon appears at any given time studies of earthshine can be used to show how the earth 's cloud cover varies over time for example , when its phase is full , the moon reflects light preferentially toward the sun and also earth , which is in almost the same direction similarly , near new moon , sunlight that has been backscattered from earth toward the sun and also the moon , which is in almost the same direction , and then backscattered again from the moon toward earth appears much brighter , as viewed from earth , than it would without the retroreflective effects it would use advanced telescope technologies to look for life-marks in the light reflected from the planets , including water , oxygen and methane unlike many traditional astronomical challenges , the most serious challenge for these missions is not gathering enough photons from the faint planet , but rather detecting a faint planet that is extremely close to a very bright star astronomers have paid particular attention to whether earthshine measurement can detect the red edge , a spectral feature that is due to plants the detection of a similar spectral feature in light from an extrasolar planet would be particularly interesting , since it might be due to a light-harvesting organism while the red edge is almost certainly the easiest way to directly detect life on earth via earthshine observations , it could be extremely difficult to interpret a similar feature due to life on another planet , since the wavelength of the spectral feature is not known in advance ( unlike most atomic or molecular spectral features )
