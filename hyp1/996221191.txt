the iao began funding research and development of the total information awareness ( tia ) program in february 2003 but renamed the program the terrorism information awareness program in may that year after an adverse media reaction to the program 's implications for public surveillance although tia was only one of several iao projects , many critics and news reports conflated tia with other related research projects of the iao , with the result that tia came in popular usage to stand for an entire subset of iao programs the tia program itself was the '' systems-level '' program of the iao that intended to integrate information technologies into a prototype system to provide tools to better detect , classify , and identify potential terrorists with the goal to increase the probability that authorized agencies of the united states could preempt adverse actions the tia program was researching , developing , and integrating technologies to virtually aggregate data , to follow subject-oriented link analysis , to develop descriptive and predictive models through data mining or human hypothesis , and to apply such models to additional datasets to identify terrorists and terrorist groups among the other iao programs that were intended to provide tia with component data aggregation and automated analysis technologies were the genisys , genisys privacy protection , evidence extraction and link discovery , and scalable social network analysis programs search results - thomas ( library of congress ) a similar measure introduced by senator ron wyden would have prohibited the iao from operating within the united states unless specifically authorized to do so by congress , and would have shut the iao down entirely 60 days after passage unless either the pentagon prepared a report to congress assessing the impact of iao activities on individual privacy and civil liberties or the president certified the program 's research as vital to national security interests in response to this legislation , darpa provided congress on may 20 , 2003 with a report on its activities the global information society project in this report , iao changed the name of the program to the terrorism information awareness program and emphasized that the program was not designed to compile dossiers on us citizens , but rather to research and develop the tools that would allow authorized agencies to gather information on terrorist networks iao research was conducted along five major investigative paths : secure collaboration problem solving ; structured discovery ; link and group understanding ; context aware visualization ; and decision making with corporate memory so they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation in order to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases , as well as unstructured public data sources , such as the world wide web '' effective analysis across heterogenous databases '' means the ability to take things from databases which are designed to store different types of dataâ€”such as a database containing criminal records , a nsa call database and a foreign intelligence database another goal was to develop '' a large , distributed system architecture for managing the huge volume of raw data input , analysis results , and feedback , that will result in a simpler , more flexible data store that performs well and allows us to retain important data indefinitely another function was to be able to make estimates of possible future scenarios to assist intelligence officials in deciding what to do , in a manner similar to the darpa 's deep green program which is designed to assist army commanders in making battlefield decisions the intent is to create a core enabling technology ( technology that is used as a component for future technologies ) suitable for a wide range of future surveillance applications bio-surveillance aimed to develop the necessary information technologies and resulting prototype capable of detecting the covert release of a biological pathogen automatically , and significantly earlier than traditional approaches unlike automated translation of natural language speech , which is much more complex due to an essentially unlimited vocabulary and grammar , the communicator program is directed task specific issues so that there are constrained vocabularies ( the system only needs to be able to understand language related to war ) research was also started to focus on foreign language computer interaction for use in supporting coalition operations wanted : competent big brothers , newsweek , 8 february 2006 , retrieved 27 july 2007 legislators included a classified annex to the defense appropriations act that preserved funding for tia 's component technologies , if they were transferred to other government agencies however , the act also stipulated that the technologies only be used for military or foreign intelligence purposes against foreigners in the following months , as more information emerged about the scope of the tia project , civil libertarians became concerned over what they saw as the potential for the development of an orwellian mass surveillance system advise , full population data mining & analysis to '' monitor social threats '' carnivore , fbi us digital interception program combat zones that see , or cts , a project to link up all security cameras citywide and '' track everything that moves '' communications assistance for law enforcement act echelon , nsa worldwide digital interception program fusion center government information awareness information processing technology office intellipedia , a collection of wikis used by the u.s
