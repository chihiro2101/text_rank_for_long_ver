git supports writing to http remotes , although the '' smart '' git protocol for http requiring special server support was made the preferred protocol over webdav linux via gvfs , including gnome files and via kio , including konqueror and dolphin macos , including native support for caldav and carddav , the design of which is based on webdav microsoft windows , including native support in explorer microsoft office the webdav working group produced several works : a requirements document : '' requirements for a distributed authoring and versioning protocol for the world wide web '' , issued february 1998 a base protocol document ( excluding versioning , despite its title ) : '' http extensions for web distributed authoring and versioning ( webdav ) '' , issued june 2007 ( which updates and supersedes '' http extensions for distributed authoring webdav '' , issued february 1999 ) the ordered collections protocol : '' web distributed authoring and versioning ( webdav ) ordered collections protocol '' , issued december 2003 the access control protocol : '' web distributed authoring and versioning ( webdav ) access control protocol '' , issued may 2004 a quota specification : '' quota and size properties for distributed authoring and versioning ( dav ) collections '' , issued february 2006 a redirect specification : '' web distributed authoring and versioning ( webdav ) redirect reference resources '' , issued march 2006 these extensions include a new verb and new headers , and properties that enable previously unmanageable file types and optimize protocol interactions for file system clients the client extensions in this specification extend the webdav protocol by introducing new headers that both enable the file types that are not currently manageable and optimize protocol interactions for file system clients the server extensions in this specification extend webdav by introducing new http request and response headers that both enable the file types that are not currently manageable and optimize protocol interactions for file system clients this specification also introduces a new webdav method that is used to send search queries to disparate search providers file transfer protocol ( ftp ) , a simple and widely adapted network protocol based on ip , allows users to transfer files between network hosts a distributed file system such as the server message block ( smb ) protocol allows microsoft windows and open-source samba clients to access and manage files and folders remotely on a suitable file server atompub , an http-based protocol for creating and updating web resources , can be used for some of the use cases of webdav cmis , a standard consisting of a set of web services for sharing information among disparate content repositories , seeks to ensure interoperability for people and applications using multiple content repositories ; it has both soap- and atompub-based interfaces wiki software , such as mediawiki linked data platform ( ldp ) , a linked data specification defining a set of integration patterns for building restful http services that are capable of read-write of rdf data
