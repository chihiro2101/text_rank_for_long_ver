in order to design a system without the shortcomings of the straight air system , westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an pressure tank and a triple valve , also known as a control valve thumb unlike the straight air system , the westinghouse system uses a reduction in air pressure in the train line to indirectly apply the brakes when the engine operator applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve , the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate , reducing the train line pressure and in turn triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder when the train brakes are applied during normal operation , the engine operator makes a '' service application '' or a '' service rate reduction ‚Äù , which means that the brake pipe pressure reduces at a controlled rate the independent brake is a '' straight air '' system that makes brake applications on the head-of-train locomotive consist independently of the automatic brake , providing for more nuanced train control the independent system also provides a bail off mechanism , which releases the brakes on the lead locomotives without affecting the brake application on the rest of the train in the event the train needs to make an emergency stop , the engine operator can make an '' emergency application , '' which will rapidly vent all of the brake pipe pressure to atmosphere , resulting in a faster application of the train 's brakes the triple valve is divided into two portions : the service section , which contains the mechanism used during brake applications made during service reductions , and the emergency section , which senses the faster emergency reduction of train line pressure normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service section to the brake cylinder , while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the sections of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder , resulting in a 20 to 30 percent stronger application due to the length of trains and the small diameter of the brake pipe , the rate of reduction is highest near the front of the train ( in the case of an engine operator-initiated emergency application ) or near the break in the brake pipe ( in the case of loss of brake pipe integrity ) , remotely controlled locomotive units mid-train and/or at the rear end ) somewhat mitigates the time-lag problem with long trains , because a telemetry radio signal from the engine operator in the front locomotive commands the distant units to initiate brake pressure reductions that propagate quickly through nearby cars the train brakes are released by admitting reduced and regulated main reservoir air pressure to the brake pipe through the engineer 's automatic brake valve the brakes are applied when the engineer moves the automatic brake handle to a '' service '' position , which causes a reduction in brake pipe pressure during normal service , the pressure in the brake pipe is never reduced to zero and in fact , the smallest reduction that will cause a satisfactory brake response is used to conserve brake pipe pressure passenger trains have had for a long time a 3-wire version of the electro-pneumatic brake , which gives up to seven levels of braking force on the conventional side , the control valve set a reference pressure in a volume , which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve this controller compared the pressure in the straight air trainline with that supplied by a self lapping portion of the engineers valve , signaling all of the '' apply '' or '' release '' magnets valves in the train to open simultaneously , changing the pressure in the '' straight air '' trainline much more rapidly and evenly than possible by simply supplying air directly from the locomotive the relay valve was equipped with four diaphragms , magnet valves , electric control equipment , and an axle-mounted speed sensor , so that at speeds over full braking force was applied , and reduced in steps at , bringing the train to a gentle stop westinghouse 24rl air brake manual later systems replace the automatic air brake with an electrical wire which runs in a circle round the whole train and has to be kept energized to keep the brakes off fully recharging the reservoirs on a long train can require considerable time ( 8 to 10 minutes in some cases emd enginemen 's operating manual ) , during which the brake pipe pressure will be lower than locomotive reservoir pressure if many brake pipe reductions are made in short succession ( '' fanning the brake '' in railroad slang ) , a point may be reached where car reservoir pressure will be severely depleted , resulting in substantially reduced brake cylinder piston force , causing the brakes to fail therefore , as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe , each car 's triple valve will cause an emergency brake application however , if the brake pipe pressure is too low due to an excessive number of brake applications , an emergency application will not produce a large enough volume of air flow to trip the triple valves , leaving the engine driver with no means to stop the train another solution to loss of brake pressure is the two-pipe system , fitted on most locomotive-hauled passenger stock and many freight wagons main reservoir pipe pressure can also be used to supply air for auxiliary systems such as pneumatic door operators or air suspension when brake pipe continuity exists throughout the train , failure of the brakes to apply or release on one or more cars is an indication that the cars ' triple valves are malfunctioning conversely , the vacuum brake had the advantage of gradual release long before the westinghouse automatic air brake , which was originally only available in the direct-release form still common in freight service
