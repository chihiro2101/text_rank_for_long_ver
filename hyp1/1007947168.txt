lines show various types of edges : a thick line shows the edge of the paper a dashed line shows a valley fold a dashed and dotted line shows a mountain fold ( there may be one or two dots per dash depending on the author ) the paper is folded behind itself , this is normally done by turning the paper over , folding a valley fold and then turning the paper back over again a dotted line shows a previous fold that 's hidden behind other paper , or sometimes shows a fold that 's not yet made reverse folds of a corner are typically used to produce feet or birds heads the version shown here is called an open sink and there is another version called a closed sink which generates a triangular pocket with no flaps showing a squash fold starts with a flap with at least two layers ( for example , one flap of a waterbomb base ) make a radial fold from the closed point down the center of this flap fold one layer of the open point upward and flatten it using the existing creases a petal fold is equivalent to two side-by-side rabbit ears , which are connected along the reference crease it is sometimes called the square base the bird base , or crane base , consists of a preliminary fold with both the front and the back sides petal folded upward however , generally swivel folds involve a flap of paper '' swivelling '' at a certain point or vertex and another flap or edge of paper , connected to the first , dragged around that point or vertex ) after forming the bird base , either partially unfold the paper , and/or '' stretch '' two opposite corners of the bird base the open sink usually involves opening out the paper , and reversing creases to make a waterbomb base in the middle of the model the open double sink is used in many box-pleated models instead of creating a long point to one side of the flap 's base , the spread squash creates a wide splat around the flap 's base it is difficult because the paper can not be opened out further than a triangle the twist fold involves , as the name implies , twisting a section of the paper with respect to its original position it is also possible to twist a single conical point indefinitely , collapsing the sides in a waterbomb-base-like fashion as one goes unsink , or sometimes open unsink , makes a concave pocket convex without fully unfolding the paper , or the opposite of an open sink it is more difficult than the closed unsink below because there is no internal flap to grab onto to help unsink the paper , so the paper must be opened out and the area to be unsunk is pushed out ( to be convex ) from inside the model and from behind in practice , it is very difficult , because the paper being '' popped '' into place usually must be pulled ( not pushed ) , and because it involves simultaneously folding over a locking flap that is hidden inside the sink
