one woman brings a basket full of yarn in order to get some work done as the assembly fills up , to which praxagora chastises her for this decision as it will ruin their cover chremes , returning from the assembly , comes upon blepyrus and his neighbor and explains that he was not paid because of the unprecedented turn-out of pale faced shoe-makers ( referring to the women in disguise ) believing she was a '' good-looking young man , '' chremes explains how he argued women were better at keeping secrets , returning borrowed items without cheating , that they don ’ t sue or inform on people or try to overthrow the democracy , all points that blepyrus agreed upon the chorus enters , still in disguise and on their way home from the assembly , trying not to draw attention to themselves she further adds that men and women will be free to sleep with anyone they want , so long as they first sleep with the uglier members of the opposite sex in the next scene , blepyrus ’ neighbor is laying his household objects out in front of his house to be contributed to the common fund as the selfish man enters he plans on waiting to see if everyone else gives up their property before he does it himself , citing failed decrees from the assembly in the past they exchange vulgar insults and go inside their homes as epigenes enters the scene , lamenting the new laws governing sex citing the new law , the old woman attempts to force epigenes to sleep with her first she finds blepyrus passing by , already on his way to dinner with two girls in his arms even though the idea of a female-led government was a fantasy at the time , it was not unfamiliar to the people of athens the ascent of women in political power in assemblywomen is yet another commentary on what aristophanes saw as the shameful effeminacy of the men currently in power in athens the fact that women in this instance could enter the assembly and successfully pass as men was a commentary on politicians being indistinguishable from women in costume though prominent in the first and last scenes of the play , the chorus ’ lack of involvement throughout the central scenes is more similar to the style of greek tragedy
