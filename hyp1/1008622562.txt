the highest position ( sometimes '' college high '' or '' open high '' ) is used for men 's sprint hurdle races ( 60 m , and 110 m ) , which are the next lower position , is called the '' women 's high '' used for women 's short hurdle races the lowest position , called the '' low hurdle '' is used for women 's long hurdles plus many youth and veteran races hurdles that go to this position are rare and are notable by having a sixth position in long hurdle events , whether for men or women , the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is when approaching the first hurdle , athletes try to avoid stutter stepping ( a term used to refer to the cutting of stride length before reaching a hurdle ) athletes attack the hurdle by launching at it from 6â€“7 feet away ( depending on runner 's closing speed ) ; the lead leg extended yet slightly bent ( because a straight leg leads to more time over the hurdle ) so that the heel just narrowly clears the barrier 's height an effective trail leg will be parallel to the top of the hurdle and will be as close to the top of the hurdle as possible this helps with the runner 's balance and rhythm throughout the race in men 's hurdles it is usually necessary to straighten the leg at the top of the flight path over the hurdle , although a partial bend in the knee gains a faster push off when the athlete hits the ground in women 's hurdles , the lead leg is usually straight and the center of gravity does not rise relative to a normal running stride as the lead leg touches down to the ground , it 's critical that the runner remains in a sprint however , pushing the hurdle with one 's hands or running out of one 's lane as a result of hitting the hurdle is cause for disqualification some coaches suggest if you lightly '' kiss '' the hurdle with the side of the leg closest to the hurdle , it can help with the runners speed by keeping the runner closer to the ground there are also shuttle hurdle relay races , although they are rarely run instead of using batons , the runners waiting for their teammate to finish must wait until their teammate gets to a certain point to begin their part of the race
