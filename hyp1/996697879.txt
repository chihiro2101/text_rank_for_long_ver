the first patent was awarded in 1979 , & nbsp ; — bridge mechanism patent ; and shortly afterward , rose made an agreement with kramer guitars because he could no longer keep up with demand manufacturing the bridges by hand it is the balance between string-tension and spring-tension , as well as the fact that the strings end at the bridge saddles and nut ( eliminating '' play '' in the string , which would negatively affect tuning ) , that brings the strings reliably back into tune when force on the bar is removed due to the limitations on the assembly 's movement imposed by the guitar 's body , the amount of available pitch change is much larger when the bar is depressed than when it is lifted the main advantage of the floyd rose vibrato system is its double-locking design in this set-up , a broken string has no effect on the pitch of the other strings , as the reduced overall string tension from the broken string does n't make the bridge move , since it already presses against the body of the guitar this also allows fitting a device to the bridge that can drop the low e-string down to d to extend the tonal variety of the guitar , even during live performance some players find that the floyd rose bridge has a '' thin '' tone , which has led to the development of replacement sustain blocks floyd rose ii is a lower end version of the original floyd used mostly on import and mid-range instruments later versions were made double locking , but used weaker materials than the original floyd rose , making them less dependable the bridge and arm design is changed in such a way that the guitarist 's hand is generally closer to the strings while holding the vibrato arm floyd rose speedloader is a redesign developed in 1995–1999 and introduced around 2003 that combines floyd rose original with the speedloader system , and requires special strings and is manufactured under license of mccabe us patents for '' macrotuners '' , ie previously , all similar double locking vibrato systems were produced under license from floyd rose , and marked as such , but in 2003 the relevant patents expired vigier floyd rose created by vigier guitars at the beginning of the '90s , this system uses force-tolerant needle bearings for improved wear on the bridge and enhanced tuning stability ( some special edition guitars used these trems prior to their reintroduction ; however , the vibratos used were nos , rather than production runs ) these two vibratos , whether old or new , bear a mark of floyd rose licensing , as they are produced using the same tooling , by japanese guitar parts manufacturer gotoh ibanez fixed edge , while it still uses the locking nut and locking bridge , was mounted on top of the body , and was used not as a vibrato system , but to provide a familiar feel to vibrato users , and even more tuning stability on a hardtailed guitar floyd rose holds a number of patents on floating bridge design : & nbsp ; — bridge mechanism patent ; & nbsp ; — first fine tuners and saddle patent ; & nbsp ; — second fine tuners and saddle patent ; & nbsp ; — spring and claw mechanism ; & nbsp ; — early patent for a tremstopper device ; & nbsp ; — patent for floyd rose pro , low-profile version ;
