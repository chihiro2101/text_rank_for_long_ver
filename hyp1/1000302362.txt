because fuel is not injected into the combustion chamber until just before the combustion is required to begin , there is little risk of engine knocking the engine can also run on a much leaner overall air/fuel ratio , using stratified charge , in which a small charge of a rich fuel mixture is ignited first and used to improve combustion of a larger charge of a lean fuel mixture disadvantages include : increased injector cost and complexity higher fuel pressure requirements carbon build-up on the back of the intake valve due to the lack of gasoline passing by the intake valve to act as a cleaning agent for the valve on traditional multi-port injection designs increased no x formation , due to the presence of extremely lean zones charge stratification can also be achieved where there is no 'in cylinder ' stratification : the inlet mixture can be so lean that it is unable to be ignited by the limited energy provided by a conventional spark plug this exceptionally lean mixture can , however , be ignited by the use of a conventional mixture strength of 12-15:1 , in the case of a petrol fuelled engine , being fed into a small combustion chamber adjacent to and connected to the main lean-mixture chamber the fuel is now injected into the cylinder and the fuel ' burn ' or expansion is started at this point by the high temperature of the , now compressed , air the principle of injecting fuel directly into the combustion chamber at the moment at which combustion is required to start was first invented by george brayton in 1887 , but it has been used to good effect in petrol engines for a long time '' another part reads '' i have for the first time , so far as my knowledge extends , regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion '' this was the first engine to use a lean burn system to regulate engine speed / output in this manner the engine fired on every power stroke and speed / output was controlled solely by the quantity of fuel injected hesselman engines used the ultra lean burn principle and injected the fuel in the end of the compression stroke and then ignited it with a spark plug , it was often started on gasoline and then switched over to run on diesel or kerosene with the stratified-charge application , the 3.0l v-6 will continue to employ direct fuel injection , but the injectors have been redesigned to spray under higher pressure later in the intake stroke , just before compression , and the fuel is shaped to arrive in certain areas within the cylinder to optimize combustion some advantages of tfsi engines : better fuel distribution and better fuel charge inside the combustion chamber during the injection process the fuel gets evaporated , cooling the cylinder chamber cooling effect of the pressurized fuel allows for use of a lower octane fuel leading to a cost savings for the end user higher compression ratios , which translates into more power increased fuel combustion efficiency higher power during pick-up of vehicle more expensive - much higher pressure fuel pumps are required to inject the fuel directly into the cylinder
