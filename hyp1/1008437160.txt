these emigrants left the cape colony for various reasons , but all shared the desire for independence from british authority in december 1836 the emigrants beyond the orange drew up in general assembly an elementary republican form of government at that time the british government was not prepared to exercise control over the immigrants some of the boer farmers in this district , unlike their fellows dwelling farther north , were willing to accept british rule this fact induced mr justice menzies , one of the judges of the cape colony then on circuit at colesberg , to cross the orange and proclaim the country british territory in october 1842 the majority of the boer farmers in kok 's territory sent a deputation to the british commissioner in natal , henry cloete , asking for equal treatment with the griquas , and expressing the desire to come under british protection under such terms british troops moved up to support the griquas , and after a skirmish at zwartkopjes ( 2 may 1845 ) a new arrangement was made between kok and peregrine maitland , the then governor of cape colony , virtually placing the administration of his territory in the hands of a british resident , a post filled in 1846 by captain henry douglas warden the place purchased by captain ( afterwards major ) warden as the seat of his court was known as bloemfontein , and it subsequently became the capital of the whole country in 1846 major warden occupied winburg for a short time , and the relations between the boers and the british were in a continual state of tension a nominated legislative council was created , a high court established and other steps taken for the orderly government of the country , which was officially styled the orange river sovereignty the british resident had , however , no force sufficient to maintain his authority , and moshoeshoe and all the neighboring clans became involved in hostilities with one another and with the europeans the british government ( under first russell ministry ) , which had reluctantly agreed to the annexation of the country , had , however , already repented its decision and had resolved to abandon the sovereignty the majority of the whites still wished for the continuance of british rule provided that it was effective and the country guarded against its enemies '' and then , '' wrote george mccall theal , '' was seen forced the strange spectacle of an english commissioner addressing men who wished to be free of british control as the friendly and well-disposed inhabitants , while for those who desired to remain british subjects and who claimed that protection to which they believed themselves entitled he had no sympathising word five days later the representatives of the elected delegates had an interview in london with the colonial secretary , the duke of newcastle , who informed them that it was now too late to discuss the question of the retention of british rule the colonial secretary added that it was impossible for england to supply troops to constantly advancing outposts , '' especially as cape town and the port of table bay were all she really required in south africa eventually , in 1861 , he sold his sovereign rights to the free state for £4000 and moved with his followers to the district later known as griqualand east on the abandonment of british rule , representatives of the people were elected and met at bloemfontein on 28 march 1854 , and between then and 18 april were engaged in framing a constitution the difficulties of the state were at that time so great that the volksraad in december 1858 passed a resolution in favour of confederation with the cape colony both parties laid claims to land beyond the warden line , and each party had taken possession of what it could , the basotho being also expert cattle-lifters many of the burghers would have at this time welcomed union with the transvaal , but learning from sir george grey that such a union would nullify the conventions of 1852 and 1854 and necessitate the reconsideration of great britain 's policy towards the native tribes north of the orange and vaal rivers , the project was dropped but before peace could be established an end had to be made of the difficulties with the basothos a treaty was signed at thaba bosiu in april 1866 , but war again broke out in 1867 , and the free state attracted to its side a large number of adventurers from all parts of south africa the offer was accepted , and on 27 october 1871 the district , together with some adjacent territory to which the transvaal had laid claim , was proclaimed , under the name of griqualand west , british territory waterboer 's claims were based on the treaty concluded by his father with the british in 1834 , and on various arrangements with the kok chiefs ; the free state based its claim on its purchase of adam kok 's sovereign rights and on long occupation the free state , however , did not abandon its claims it was then disposed of by henry herbert , 4th earl of carnarvon , at that time secretary of state for the colonies , who granted to the free state a £90,000 payment '' in full satisfaction of all claims which it considers it may possess to griqualand west the influx of british and other immigrants to the diamond fields , in the early 1870s , restored public credit and individual prosperity to the boers of the free state the relations between the british and the orange free state , after the question of the boundary was settled , remained perfectly amicable down to the outbreak of the second boer war in 1899 at the time of the first annexation of the transvaal the free state declined lord carnarvon 's invitation to federate with the other south african communities this suggestion was not acted upon , but when war broke out in the transvaal , brand declined to take any part in the struggle in spite of the neutral attitude taken by their government a number of the orange free state boers , living in the northern part of the country , went to the transvaal and joined their brethren then in arms against the british this fact was not allowed to influence the friendly relations between the free state and great britain in 1889 an agreement made between the orange free state and the cape colony government , whereby the latter was empowered to extend , at its own cost , its railway system to bloemfontein having accepted the assistance of the cape government in constructing its railway , the state also in 1889 entered into a customs union convention with them natal at this time had not seen its way to entering the customs union , but did so at a later date the political treaty referred in general terms to a federal union between the south african republic and the orange free state , and bound each of them to help the other , whenever the independence of either should be assailed or threatened from without , unless the state so called upon for assistance should be able to show the injustice of the cause of quarrel in which the other state had engaged while thus committed to an alliance with its northern neighbour no change was made in internal administration the state , however , became increasingly identified with the reactionary party in the south african republic a further offensive and defensive alliance between the two republics was then entered into , under which the orange free state took up arms on the outbreak of hostilities between the british and the south african republic in october 1899 the free staters were practically bound to the south african republic , under the offensive and defensive alliance , in case hostilities arose with great britain the orange free state began to expel british subjects in 1899 , and the first act of the second boer war was committed by orange free state boers , who , on 11 october 1899 , seized a train upon the border belonging to natal for nearly two years longer the burghers kept the field under christiaan de wet and other leaders , but by the articles of peace signed on 31 may 1902 british sovereignty was acknowledged
