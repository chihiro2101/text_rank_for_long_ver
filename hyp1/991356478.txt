passing through these two equilibrium points , debris can commute between the external region ( figure-eights of yellow and green in the outer side ) and the communal gravity region of the binary system in principle , mass transfer could lead to the total disintegration of the object , since a reduction of the object 's mass causes its roche lobe to shrink second , with the transfer of mass between the two binary components , angular momentum is transferred as well the expansion of the binary orbit will lead to a less dramatic shrinkage or even expansion of the donor 's roche lobe , often preventing the destruction of the donor to determine the stability of the mass transfer and hence exact fate of the donor star , one needs to take into account how the radius of the donor star and that of its roche lobe react to the mass loss from the donor ; if the star expands faster than its roche lobe or shrinks less rapidly than its roche lobe for a prolonged time , mass transfer will be unstable and the donor star may disintegrate if the donor star expands less rapidly or shrinks faster than its roche lobe , mass transfer will generally be stable and may continue for a long time mass transfer happens rapidly on the dynamical time scale of the star and may end with a complete merger similar to ad , but as the star onto which matter is rapidly accreting gains mass , it gains physical size enough for it to reach its own roche-lobe similar to as , but the star gaining mass overtakes the star donating mass to evolve past the main sequence the donor star can shrink so small to stop mass transfer , but eventually mass transfer will start again as stellar evolution continues leading to the cases mass transfer does not begin until the star reaches the red giant branch but before it has exhausted its hydrogen core ( after which the system is described as case b ) this case can be further subdivided into classes br and bc according to whether the mass transfer occurs from a star dominated by a radiation zone ( br ) and therefore evolves as the situation with most case a rlof or a convective zone ( bc ) after which a common envelope phase may occur ( similar to case c )
