recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities four characteristics definitively separate adult tsetse from other kinds of flies : the infection progresses into the blood stream and eventually crosses into the central nervous system and invades the brain leading to extreme lethargy and eventually to death these diseases reduce the growth rate , milk productivity , and strength of farm animals , generally leading to the eventual death of the infected animals certain species of cattle are called trypanotolerant because they can survive and grow even when infected with trypanosomes although they also have lower productivity rates when infected other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly economic analysis indicates that the cost of managing trypanosomosis through the elimination of important populations of major tsetse vectors will be covered several times by the benefits of tsetse-free status area-wide interventions against the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem appear more efficient and profitable if sufficiently large areas , with high numbers of cattle , can be covered many techniques have reduced tsetse populations , with earlier , crude methods recently replaced by methods that are cheaper , more directed , and ecologically better one early technique involved slaughtering all the wild animals tsetse fed on while the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s , the new population of tsetse was free from the disease the use of chemicals as attractants to lure tsetse to the traps has been studied extensively in the late 20th century , but this has mostly been of interest to scientists rather than as an economically reasonable solution the traps are just the entry point , followed by improved farming , human health and marketing inputs as a result , this technique can eventually eradicate populations of wild flies the sustainable removal of the tsetse fly is in many cases the most cost-effective way of dealing with the t & t problem resulting in major economic benefits for subsistence farmers in rural areas insecticide-based methods are normally very ineffective in removing the last remnants of tsetse populations , while , on the contrary , sterile males are very effective in finding and mating the last remaining females therefore , the integration of the sit as the last component of an area-wide integrated approach is essential in many situations to achieve complete eradication of the different tsetse populations , particularly in areas of more dense vegetation feasibility studies indicated that the fly population was confined to very fragmented habitats and a population genetics study indicated that the population was genetically isolated from the main tsetse belt in the south eastern part of senegal after completion of the feasibility studies ( 2006â€“2010 ) , an area-wide integrated eradication campaign that included an sit component was started in 2011 , and by 2015 , the niayes region had become almost tsetse fly free the entire target area ( block 1 , 2 and 3 ) has a total surface of 1000 km2 , and the first block ( northern part ) can be considered free of tsetse , as intensive monitoring has failed to detect since 2012 a single wild tsetse fly although insecticides are being used for fly suppression , they are applied for short periods on traps , nets and livestock , and are not spread into the environment results suggest that the tsetse decimated livestock populations , forcing early states to rely on slave labor to clear land for farming , and preventing farmers from taking advantage of natural animal fertilizers to increase crop production the authors also suggest that under a lower burden of tsetse , africa would have developed differently agriculture ( measured by the usage of large domesticated animals , intensive agriculture , plow use and female participation rate in agriculture ) as well as institutions ( measured by the appearance of indigenous slavery and levels of centralization ) would have been more like those found in eurasia while this is certainly true for areas with high densities of the fly , similar cases outside tsetse-suitable areas exist while the fly definitely had a relevant influence on the adoption of new technologies in africa , it has been contended that it does not represent the single root cause
