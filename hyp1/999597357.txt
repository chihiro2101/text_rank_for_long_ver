though oppenheimer had asked bohm to work with him at los alamos ( the top-secret laboratory established in 1942 to design the atom bomb ) , the project 's director , brigadier general leslie groves , would not approve bohm 's security clearance after seeing evidence of his politics and his close friendship with weinberg , who had been suspected of espionage without security clearance , bohm was denied access to his own work ; not only would he be barred from defending his thesis , he was not even allowed to write his own thesis in the first place ! '' to satisfy the university , oppenheimer certified that bohm had successfully completed the research he also worked closely with albert einstein at the nearby institute for advanced study dodds russell olwell : physics and politics in cold war america : the two exiles of david bohm , working paper number 20 although einstein considered appointing him as his research assistant at the institute , oppenheimer ( who had served as the institute 's president since 1947 ) '' opposed the idea and : science and exile : david bohm , the cold war , and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics , hsps , vol during his early period , bohm made a number of significant contributions to physics , particularly quantum mechanics and relativity theory his first book , quantum theory , published in 1951 , was well received by einstein , among others he began to develop his own interpretation ( the de broglie–bohm theory , also called the pilot wave theory ) , the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory he initially called his approach a hidden variable theory , but he later called it ontological theory , reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found bohm and his colleague basil hiley later stated that they had found their own choice of terms of an '' interpretation in terms of hidden variables '' to be too restrictive , especially since their variables , position , and momentum '' are not actually hidden '' bohm 's work and the epr paradox became the major factor motivating john stewart bell 's inequality , which rules out local hidden variable theories ; the full consequences of bell 's work are still being investigated after bohm 's arrival in brazil on 10 october 1951 , the us consul in são paulo confiscated his passport , informing him he could retrieve it only to return to his country , which reportedly frightened bohm russell olwell : physics and politics in cold war america : the two exiles of david bohm , working paper number & nbsp ;

1070–1076 ( abstract ) it was that form of the epr paradox that was discussed by john stewart bell in his famous paper of 1964 stuart : on a new mode of description in physics , international journal of theoretical physics , vol david peat : science , order , and creativity , 1987 in the view of bohm and hiley , '' things , such as particles , objects , and indeed subjects '' exist as '' semi-autonomous quasi-local features '' of an underlying activity in that picture , the classical limit for quantum phenomena , in terms of a condition that the action function is not much greater than planck 's constant , indicates one such criterion in addition to his scientific work , bohm was deeply interested in exploring the nature of consciousness , with particular attention to the role of thought as it relates to attention , motivation , and conflict in the individual and in society a more recent and extensive examination of the relationship between the two men presents it in a more positive light and shows that bohm 's work in the psychological field was complementary to and compatible with his contributions to theoretical physics it was one of a series of seminars held by bohm at oak grove school , and it was published as thought as a system in the seminar , bohm described the pervasive influence of thought throughout society , including the many erroneous assumptions about the nature of thought and its effects in daily life he points out that thought is the ubiquitous tool that is used to solve every kind of problem : personal , social , scientific , and so on in his book on creativity , quoting alfred korzybski , the polish-american who developed the field of general semantics , bohm expressed the view that '' metaphysics is an expression of a world view '' and is '' thus to be regarded as an art form , resembling poetry in some ways and mathematics in others , rather than as an attempt to say something true about reality as a whole '' in his book science , order and creativity , bohm referred to the views of various biologists on the evolution of the species , including rupert sheldrake gardner said that bohm 's view of the interconnectedness of mind and matter ( on one occasion , he summarized : '' even the electron is informed with a certain level of mind to address societal problems during his later years , bohm wrote a proposal for a solution that has become known as '' bohm dialogue '' , in which equal status and '' free space '' form the most important prerequisites of communication and the appreciation of differing personal beliefs he also spoke to audiences across europe and north america on the importance of dialogue as a form of sociotherapy , a concept he borrowed from london psychiatrist and practitioner of group analysis patrick de maré , and he had a series of meetings with the dalai lama there was a significant revival of interest in bohm 's ideas in the late 1950s and the early 1960s ; the ninth symposium of the colston research society in bristol in 1957 was a key turning point toward greater tolerance of his ideas the film infinite potential is based on bohm 's life and studies ;
