according to penfield , '' the old data showed a large concentric set of onshore gravity anomalies image : chicxulub shockedquartz.png thumb penfield with the sample of shocked quartz found at well 2 , chicxulub pemex disallowed release of specific data but let penfield and company official antonio camargo present their results at the 1981 society of exploration geophysicists conference coincidentally , many experts in impact craters and the cretaceous–paleogene boundary were attending a separate conference on earth impacts this layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an earth impact , but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a lava dome—a feature uncharacteristic of the region 's geology thick , jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present , thought to have been scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an earth impact hildebrand interview : 'similar deposits of rubble occur all across the southern coast of north america … indicate that something extraordinary happened here a team of california researchers including kevin pope , adriana ocampo , and charles duller , surveying regional satellite images in 1996 , found a cenote ( sinkhole ) ring centered on chicxulub that matched the one penfield saw earlier ; the cenotes were thought to be caused by subsidence of bolide-weakened lithostratigraphy around the impact crater wall more recent evidence suggests the crater is wide , and the 180 & nbsp ; km ring is an inner wall of it the impact created a hole wide and deep , leaving a crater mainly under the sea and covered by of sediment by the 21st century '' fossil evidence for an instantaneous die-off of diverse animals was found in a soil layer only thick in new jersey away from the impact site , indicating that death and burial under debris occurred suddenly and quickly over wide distances on land field research from the hell creek formation in north dakota published in 2019 shows the simultaneous mass extinction of myriad species combined with geological and atmospheric features consistent with the impact event the emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the earth for several years , possibly a decade , creating a harsh environment for living things '' this was borne out by the results of a drilling project in 2016 which found that sulfate-containing rocks found in the area were not found in the peak ring ( the rocks found were from deep within the earth 's crust instead ) , the interpretation being that they had been vaporized by the impact and dispersed into the atmosphere the k–pg boundary inside the feature is depressed to compared with the normal depth of about measured away from the impact feature this makes an asteroid from this family highly improbable to be the asteroid that created the chicxulub crater , as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years in february 2021 , scientists reported studies suggesting the impactor that led to the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was a fragment from a disrupted comet , rather than an asteroid which has long been the leading candidate among scientists luis and walter alvarez , at the time both faculty members at the university of california , berkeley , postulated that this enormous extinction event , which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the chicxulub crater , could have been caused by just such a large impact in 2013 a study compared isotopes in impact glass from the chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the extinction event occurred in the fossil record ; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66.038 ± 0.049 ma , and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 ± 0.021 ma , the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other , or almost exactly the same within experimental error the main evidence of such an impact , besides the crater itself , is contained in a thin layer of clay present in the k–pg boundary across the world similarly , an iridium anomaly in core samples from the pacific ocean suggested the eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago in a march 2019 article in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , an international team of twelve scientists revealed the contents of the tanis fossil site discovered near bowman , north dakota that appeared to show the destruction of an ancient lake and its inhabitants at the time of the chicxulub impact the exact mechanism of the site 's destruction has been debated as either an impact-caused tsunami or lake and river seiche activity triggered by post-impact earthquakes ; there has yet been no firm conclusion upon which researchers have settled this has led to the hypothesis that the chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger shiva crater , though the structure 's status as an impact crater is contested this scenario may have occurred on earth at the end of the cretaceous , though shiva and the chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart macleod conducted his analysis approximately from the chicxulub crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site , while still close enough to be affected by the impact the analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment , which indicated there was only one impact 364 obtained the first offshore core samples from the peak ring , surrounding the central zone of the crater it was announced in november 2016 that pink granite , usually found deep in the earth 's crust , had been found in drilling samples the findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated deep in the earth , and was ejected to the surface it had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat and shocked by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes ; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant , since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits , originating much deeper in the earth , and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact gypsum , a sulfate-containing rock usually present in the shallow seabed of the region , had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere , an event immediately followed by a megatsunami sufficient to lay down the largest-known layered bed of sand , around deep and separated by grain size , directly above the peak ring taken together , analyses indicate that the impactor was large enough to create a peak ring , to melt , shock and eject granite from many kilometers within the earth , to create colossal water movements , and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere , where they would have persisted over years to decades a 2020 study mentioned that expedition 364 drilled to a depth of below the sea floor to reach the peak ring , and discovered a massive hydrothermal system filled with magma , which modified ~1.4 × 10 5 km 3 of earth 's crust and lasted for hundreds of thousands of years ; in addition , those hydrothermal system might support the impact origin of life hypothesis for the hadean , when the entire surface of earth was affected by impactors enormously larger than the chicxulub impactor .
