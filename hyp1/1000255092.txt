this article will explore many aspects of infrastructure , including classification , applications , related concepts , ownership and financing , the developing world , and its sustainable future & nbsp ; both specific functional modes – highways , streets , roads , and bridges ; mass transit ; airports and airways ; water supply and water resources ; wastewater management ; solid-waste treatment and disposal ; electric power generation and transmission ; telecommunications ; and hazardous waste – and the combined system these modal elements comprise a comprehension of infrastructure spans not only these public works facilities , but also the operating procedures , management practices , and development policies that interact together with societal demand and the physical world to facilitate the transport of people and goods , provision of water for drinking and a variety of other uses , safe disposal of society 's waste products , provision of energy where it is needed , and transmission of information within and between communities as the united states presumably looks to upgrade its existing infrastructure , sustainable measures could be a consideration of the design , build , and operation plans many were built within the last 50 years , which means many infrastructures are needing substantial maintenance to continue functioning green infrastructure uses plant or soil systems to restore some of the natural processes needed to manage water and create healthier urban environments green infrastructure has become an increasingly popular strategy in recent years due to its effectiveness in providing ecological , economic , and social benefits -- including positively impacting energy consumption , air quality , and carbon reduction and sequestration smart cities utilize innovative methods of design and implementation in various sectors of infrastructure and planning to create communities that operate at a higher level of relative sustainability than their traditional counterparts in a sustainable city , urban resilience as well as infrastructure reliability must both be present urban resilience is defined by a city ’ s capacity to quickly adapt or recover from infrastructure defects , and infrastructure reliability means that systems must work efficiently while continuing to maximize their output when urban resilience and infrastructure reliability interact , cities are able to produce the same level of output at similarly reasonable costs as compared to other non sustainable communities , while still maintaining ease of operation and usage some individuals have referred to this planned settlement as “ utopia-like ” , due to the fact that it will feature multiple sustainable infrastructure elements , including energy , water , waste management , and transportation masdar city is located in a desert region , meaning that sustainable collection and distribution of water is dependent on the city ’ s ability to utilize water at innovative stages of the water cycle additionally , the city will implement a system to convert waste into fertilizer , which will decrease the amount of space needed for waste accumulation as well as provide an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fertilizer production methods body of knowledge on infrastructure regulation next generation infrastructures international research programme report card on america 's infrastructure
