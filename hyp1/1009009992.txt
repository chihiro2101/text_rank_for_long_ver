when a designer designs something – whether a house , computer program , or lamp – they must make many decisions about how to solve problems a single problem is documented with its typical place ( the syntax ) , and use ( the grammar ) with the most common and recognized good solution seen in the wild , like the examples seen in dictionary elemental or universal patterns such as '' door '' or '' partnership '' are versatile ideals of design , either as found in experience or for use as components in practice , explicitly described as holistic resolutions of the forces in recurrent contexts and circumstances , whether in architecture , medicine , software development or governance , etc in pattern languages for design , the parts break down in this way : the language description – the vocabulary – is a collection of named , described solutions to problems in a field of interest in the language description , grammar and syntax cross index ( often with a literal alphabetic index of pattern names ) to other named solutions , so the designer can quickly think from one solution to related , needed solutions , and document them in a logical way this simplifies the design work because designers can start the process from any part of the problem they understand and work toward the unknown parts at the same time , if the pattern language has worked well for many projects , there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process , and the result will be usable just as words must have grammar and semantic relationships to each other in order to make a spoken language useful , design patterns must be related to each other in position and utility order to form a pattern language this gives the designer using the language a great deal of guidance about the related problems that must be solved the most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable , complete list of the problems to be solved an important aspect of design patterns is to identify and document the key ideas that make a good system different from a poor system ( that may be a house , a computer program or an object of daily use ) , and to assist in the design of future systems the idea expressed in a pattern should be general enough to be applied in very different systems within its context , but still specific enough to give constructive guidance the range of situations in which the problems and solutions addressed in a pattern apply is called its context usually the author of a pattern language or collection chooses a generic structure for all the patterns it contains , breaking each into generic sections like context , problem statement , solution etc christopher alexander 's patterns , for instance , each consist of a short name , a rating ( up to two ' ' symbols ) , a sensitizing picture , the context description , the problem statement , a longer part of text with examples and explanations , a solution statement , a sketch and further references when design is done by a team , pattern names will form a vocabulary they can share a pattern language , as conceived by alexander , contains links from one pattern to another , so when trying to apply one pattern in a project , a designer is pushed to other patterns that are considered helpful in its context alexander argues that the connections in the network can be considered even more meaningful than the text of the patterns themselves the idea of linking is generally accepted among pattern authors , though the semantic rationale behind the links may vary in design patterns , make only little use of pattern linking – possibly because it did not make that much sense for their collection of patterns in such a case we would speak of a pattern catalogue rather than a pattern language in order to enable this , his books do not focus strictly on architecture or civil engineering ; he also explains the general method of pattern languages for additional discussion of motivation and rationale as well as examples and experiments , see : alexander 's specifications for using pattern languages as well as creating new ones remain influential , and his books are referenced for style by experts in unrelated fields however , the process of designing a new recipe might benefit from the use of a pattern language while a pattern language contains 253 '' patterns '' from the first pattern , '' independent regions '' ( the most general ) to the last , '' things from your life '' , alexander 's book the timeless way of building goes into more depth about the motivation and purpose of the work the following definitions of '' pattern '' and '' pattern language '' are paraphrased from a pattern language : '' a pattern is a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem within a building context , describing one of the configurations that brings life to a building each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment , and then describes the core solution to that problem , in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over , without ever doing it the same way twice '' a pattern language is a network of patterns that call upon one another the book liberating voices : a pattern language for communication revolution , containing 136 patterns for using information and communication to promote sustainability , democracy and positive social change , was published in 2008 along with a website containing even more patterns a pattern language for pattern writing by gerard meszaros and jim doble use of patterns for scenario development for large scale aerospace projects lean startup business model pattern what is a quality use case ? from the book patterns for effective use cases patternlanguage.com , by the center for environmental structure fused grid – a contemporary urban pattern '' a collection and synthesis of neighbourhood patterns '' hcipatterns.org – patterns for hci the portland pattern repository group works : a pattern language for bringing life to meetings and other gatherings – a pattern language of group process the core protocols – a set of team communication patterns liberating voices ! pattern language project — short versions of patterns available in arabic , chinese , and spanish fi : suunnittelumalli
