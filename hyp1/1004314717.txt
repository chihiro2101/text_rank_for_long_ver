by the 1840s , there were a number of proposals to build railways in the region , and the river don navigation company acted to ensure they would remain in business with the manchester ship canal under construction , and other large canals being proposed , a committee was formed to investigate a new canal from sheffield to the sea their report , presented in october 1888 , suggested that the existing locks on the route from sheffield to keadby were inadequate , but that the waterway could be upgraded to take 300- to 500-ton boats by building new locks alongside the old , without disrupting traffic the sheffield and south yorkshire canal company limited was formed in november 1888 , with a capital of £30,000 , to promote this new venture and obtain the necessary act of parliament the new company obtained an act of parliament on 26 august 1889 , creating the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation company , which was authorised to raise £1.5 & nbsp ; million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation , or by compulsory purchase if after nine months negotiations with the railway company had failed to reach an agreement they could also improve the canals they bought , or build new ones , and could also act as inland carriers meanwhile , negotiations had also taken place with the aire and calder , and an agreement had been reached to connect the two systems together by a canal , so that the improved don could use goole for the export of coal , rather than having to develop keadby the railway company therefore nominated half of the ten directors , and there was no capital to fund the ambitious plans for the modernisation of the system , although some further developments took place despite the lack of capital , the new company somehow managed to finance improvements to sheffield basin , including a four-storey warehouse which straddled part of the basin they were also faced with the prospect of funding their half of the new junction canal , to provide the connection with the aire and calder navigation some straightening of the navigation near doncaster had been carried out , but they noted that more would be required at sprotborough and doncaster to make full use of compartment boats doncaster lock was extended in 1909 and 1910 , and improvements were made at doncaster , rotherham and tinsley , but trade declined significantly with the onset of the first world war , as many of the steam trawlers which had previously used coal from the waterway were requisitioned by the admiralty , and were fuelled elsewhere while they thought that the waterway should be nationalised , they were in principle willing to part-fund improvements providing control by the railway company was ended the estimated cost for these improvements was £1,483,426 , but the economic circumstances of the time meant that the government was not prepared to support the scheme , and whereas the neighbouring corporation of nottingham funded improvements to the river trent without government support , sheffield were not prepared to do the same for the don the effort made in the 1980s to attract traffic to the waterway below rotherham did not extend to the stretch above the town : the locks remained suitable only for much smaller barges
