a man named will ( which can be understood either simply as a personal name or as an allegory for a person 's will , in the sense of 'desire , intention ' ) falls asleep and has a vision of a tower set upon a hill and a fortress ( donjon ) in a deep valley ; between these symbols of heaven and hell is a 'fair field full of folk ' , representing the world of mankind a satirical account of different sections of society follows , along with a dream-like fable representing the king as a cat and his people as rodents who consider whether to bell the cat passus 1 : holy church visits will and explains the tower of truth , and discusses truth more generally passus 17 : next , will meets hope/moses , characterised by the tablets of law , who is also in search of christ this attribution rests principally on the evidence of an early-fifteenth-century manuscript of the c-text ( see below ) of piers held at trinity college , dublin ( ms 212 ) , which ascribes the work to one man , called 'willielmus de langlond ' : ; translation other manuscripts also name the author as '' robert or william langland '' , or '' wilhelmus w the attribution to william langland is also based on internal evidence , primarily a seemingly autobiographical section in passus 5 of the c-text of the poem this could be a coded reference to the poet 's name , in the style of much late-medieval literature new evidence suggests that this reverse cryptogram was read as '' will long will '' by contemporary scribes and that the rebels of 1381 used this name as pseudonym alongside the name '' piers plowman '' langland 's authorship , however , is not entirely beyond dispute , as recent work by stella pates and c in their work , '' the langland myth '' , they claim there is not enough evidence to suggest that langland is , in fact , the author , but instead that it is the work of a man by the name of william de la rokele ) the character of piers himself had come to be considered by many readers to be in some sense the author with crowley 's editions , the poem followed an existing and subsequently repeated convention of titling the poem the vision of piers or pierce plowman , which is in fact the conventional name of just one section of the poem one scholar now disputes the single-author hypothesis , supposing that the poem may be the work of between two and five authors , depending upon how authorship is defined in keeping with contemporary scholarly trends in textual criticism , critical theory , and the history of the book , charlotte brewer , among others , suggests that scribes and their supervisors be regarded as editors with semi-authorial roles in the production of piers plowman and other early modern texts , but this has nothing to do with manly 's argument none of the texts are known to be in the author 's own hand , and none of them derive directly from any of the others skeat argued that there are as many as ten forms of the poem , but only three are to be considered authoritative & mdash ; the a , b , and c-texts & mdash ; although the definition of '' authoritative '' in this context is problematic although precise dating is debated , the a , b , and c texts are now commonly thought of as the progressive ( 20–25 & nbsp ; years ) work of a single author it breaks off , apparently unfinished , at book 11 , and book 12 is written by another author or interpolator the kane , kane-donaldson , and russell-kane editions of the three versions , published by the athlone press , have been controversial , but are considered among the most important accomplishments in modern editorial work and theory in middle english more recently , lawrence warner has shown that what was thought of as b in fact incorporates matter produced as part of the c-revision : if b circulated before c , it looked nothing like what previous editors had assumed new evidence suggests that in norfolk the rebels of 1381 had access to the b version of the text and that they used the author-persona 's name - will long will - as a pseudonym no doubt because of ball 's writings , the dieulacres abbey chronicle account of the revolt refers to piers , seemingly as a real person who was a leader with ball in the revolt similarly , early in the history of the poem 's dissemination in manuscript form , piers is often treated as the author of the poem since it is hard to see how this is credible to those who read the poem , perhaps the idea was that piers was a mask for the author or , as the ideal character of the poem , piers might be seen as a kind of alter-ego for the poet that was more important to his early readers than the obviously authorial narrator and his apparent self-disclosures as will the earliest literary works comprising the piers plowman tradition follow in the wake of these events , although they and their sixteenth-century successors are not anti-monarchical or supportive of rebellion like william langland , who may have written the c-text version of piers plowman to disassociate himself from the rising , they look for the reform of the english church and society by the removal of abuses in what the authors deem a restorative rather than an innovative project crowley may have made small attempts to remove or soften single references to transubstantiation , the mass , purgatory , and the virgin mary as a mediator and object of devotion ( although almost a dozen references to purgatory remain , as well as three significant references to mary ) the few people who mention piers plowman before 1700 usually attribute it to someone other than langland , and often it is unclear whether they are referring to langland 's poem or one of the many other texts circulating in print as part of the piers plowman tradition , particularly the ploughman 's tale since piers was conflated with the author and dreamer-narrator of the poem at an early date , '' piers plowman '' or a latin equivalent is often given as the name of the author , which indicates unfamiliarity with , or disbelief of , crowley 's preface '' despite the work of bale and crowley , langland 's name appears to have remained unknown or unaccepted since other authors were suggested after crowley 's editions sometimes '' piers plowman '' was referred to as the author of the poem , and when writers refer to a list of medieval authors , they will often mention '' piers plowman '' as an author 's name or a substitute for one one gets the overall impression that langland and piers plowman had less existence as author and text than did the fictional figure of piers , whose relationship to a definite authorial and textual origin had been obscured much earlier the end of piers plowman , passus 15 , makes this point at length—but it is also made briefly in one stanza in the ploughman 's tale ( ll '' milton refers to the vision and crede of pierce ploughman , which might mean one or both of these texts perhaps it refers to rogers ' 1561 edition which put them together henry selden ( 1622 ) appears to have read the poem closely enough to admire it for its criticism of the church as well as its judgment and invention fuller also notes that the praier and complaynte of the ploweman unto christe was '' first set forth by tindal , since , exemplified by mr '' since the language of this text is similar to that of piers plowman , fuller attributes it to langland as well skeat , piers plowman could be , respectively , a consciousness-raising text in the working man 's college or a patriotic text for grammar school pupils piers plowman has often been read primarily as a political document many subsequent texts – at least 14 – use characters from piers plowman , most often piers himself many more texts were written with similar themes and characters , though not directly borrowing from piers plowman , until around the end of the 16th century
