in the paper phillips describes how he observed an inverse relationship between money wage changes and unemployment in the british economy over the period examined similar patterns were found in other countries and in 1960 paul samuelson and robert solow took phillips ' work and made explicit the link between inflation and unemployment : when inflation was high , unemployment was low , and vice versa however , phillips ' original curve described the behavior of money wages they could tolerate a reasonably high rate of inflation as this would lead to lower unemployment â€“ there would be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment moving along the phillips curve , this would lead to a higher inflation rate , the cost of enjoying lower unemployment rates some of this criticism is based on the united states ' experience during the 1970s , which had periods of high unemployment and high inflation at the same time it would be wrong , though , to think that our figure 2 menu that related obtainable price and unemployment behavior will maintain its same shape in the longer run '' as samuelson and solow had argued 8 years earlier , he argued that in the long run , workers and employers will take inflation into account , resulting in employment contracts that increase pay at rates near anticipated inflation this implication is significant for practical reasons because it implies that central banks should not set unemployment targets below the natural rate but still today , modified forms of the phillips curve that take inflationary expectations into account remain influential in the long run , that relationship breaks down and the economy eventually returns to the natural rate of unemployment regardless of the inflation rate in the long run , this implies that monetary policy can not affect unemployment , which adjusts back to its '' natural rate '' , also called the '' nairu '' or '' long-run phillips curve '' like the expectations-augmented phillips curve , the new keynesian phillips curve implies that increased inflation can lower unemployment temporarily , but can not lower it permanently the latter theory , also known as the '' natural rate of unemployment '' , distinguished between the '' short-term '' phillips curve and the '' long-term '' one however , in the short-run policymakers will face an inflation-unemployment rate trade-off marked by the '' initial short-run phillips curve '' in the graph policymakers can , therefore , reduce the unemployment rate temporarily , moving from point a to point b through expansionary policy however , according to the nairu , exploiting this short-run trade-off will raise inflation expectations , shifting the short-run curve rightward to the '' new short-run phillips curve '' and moving the point of equilibrium from b to c thus the reduction in unemployment below the '' natural rate '' will be temporary , and lead only to higher inflation in the long run the rational expectations theory said that expectations of inflation were equal to what actually happened , with some minor and temporary errors this , in turn , suggested that the short-run period was so short that it was non-existent : any effort to reduce unemployment below the nairu , for example , would immediately cause inflationary expectations to rise and thus imply that the policy would fail unemployment would never deviate from the nairu except due to random and transitory mistakes in developing expectations about future inflation rates furthermore , the concept of rational expectations had become subject to much doubt when it became clear that the main assumption of models based on it was that there exists a single ( unique ) equilibrium in the economy that is set ahead of time , determined independently of demand conditions it is not that high inflation causes low unemployment ( as in milton friedman 's theory ) as much as vice versa : low unemployment raises worker bargaining power , allowing them to successfully push for higher nominal wages similarly , built-in inflation is not simply a matter of subjective '' inflationary expectations '' but also reflects the fact that high inflation can gather momentum and continue beyond the time when it was started , due to the objective price/wage spiral they reject the phillips curve entirely , concluding that unemployment 's influence is only a small portion of a much larger inflation picture that includes prices of raw materials , intermediate goods , cost of raising capital , worker productivity , land , and other factors gordon of northwestern university has analyzed the phillips curve to produce what he calls the triangle model , in which the actual inflation rate is determined by the sum of demand pull inflation , cost push inflation , and built-in inflation changes in built-in inflation follow the partial-adjustment logic behind most theories of the nairu : low unemployment encourages high inflation , as with the simple phillips curve ) high unemployment encourages low inflation , again as with a simple phillips curve the ends of this '' non-accelerating inflation range of unemployment rates '' change over time
