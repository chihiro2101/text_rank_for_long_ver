pietism did not die out in the 18th century , but was alive and active in the american deutscher evangelischer kirchenverein des westens ( german evangelical church society of the west , based in gravois , later german evangelical synod of north america and still later the evangelical and reformed church , a precursor of the united church of christ a discussion of some of the earlier pietist influence in the evangelical and reformed church can be found in dunn et al , '' a history of the evangelical and reformed church '' christian education press , philadelphia , 1962 some vestiges of pietism were still present in 1957 at the time of the formation of the united church of christ in the 21st century pietism is still alive in groups inside the evangelical church in germany however , in the 19th century , there was a revival of confessional lutheran doctrine , known as the neo-lutheranism heppe and ritschl – have included under it nearly all religious tendencies amongst protestants of the last three centuries in the direction of a more serious cultivation of personal piety than that prevalent in the various established churches some historians also speak of a later or modern pietism , characterizing thereby a party in the german church probably influenced by remains of spener 's pietism in westphalia , on the rhine , in württemberg , halle upon saale , and berlin the party , termed the repristination movement , was chiefly distinguished by its opposition to an independent scientific study of theology , its principal theological leader being hengstenberg and its chief literary organ , the evangelische kirchenzeitung pietism also had a strong influence on contemporary artistic culture in germany ; though unread today , the pietist johann georg hamann held a strong influence in his day amongst them were the christian mystic jakob böhme ( behmen ) ; johann arndt , whose work , true christianity , became widely known and appreciated ; heinrich müller , who described the font , the pulpit , the confessional , and the altar as '' the four dumb idols of the lutheran church '' ; the theologian johann valentin andrea , court chaplain of the landgrave of hesse ; schuppius , who sought to restore the bible to its place in the pulpit ; and theophil großgebauer ( d born at rappoltsweiler in alsace , now in france , on 13 january 1635 , trained by a devout godmother who used books of devotion like arndt 's true christianity , spener was convinced of the necessity of a moral and religious reformation within german lutheranism he studied theology at strasbourg , where the professors at the time ( and especially sebastian schmidt ) were more inclined to '' practical '' christianity than to theological disputation during a stay in tübingen , spener read grossgebauer 's alarm cry , and in 1666 he entered upon his first pastoral charge at frankfurt with a profound opinion that the christian life within evangelical lutheranism was being sacrificed to zeal for rigid lutheran orthodoxy pietism , as a distinct movement in the german church , began with religious meetings at spener 's house ( collegia pietatis ) where he repeated his sermons , expounded passages of the new testament , and induced those present to join in conversation on religious questions in 1675 , spener published his pia desideria or earnest desire for a reform of the true evangelical church , the title giving rise to the term '' pietists '' in pia desideria , spener made six proposals as the best means of restoring the life of the church : the earnest and thorough study of the bible in private meetings , ecclesiolae in ecclesia ( '' little churches within the church '' ) the christian priesthood being universal , the laity should share in the spiritual government of the church a knowledge of christianity must be attended by the practice of it as its indispensable sign and supplement instead of merely didactic , and often bitter , attacks on the heterodox and unbelievers , a sympathetic and kindly treatment of them a reorganization of the theological training of the universities , giving more prominence to the devotional life a different style of preaching , namely , in the place of pleasing rhetoric , the implanting of christianity in the inner or new man , the soul of which is faith , and its effects the fruits of life this work produced a great impression throughout germany in leipzig , a society of young theologians was formed under his influence for the learned study and devout application of the bible the lectures , however , aroused the ill-will of the other theologians and pastors of leipzig , and francke and his friends left the city , and with the aid of christian thomasius and spener founded the new university of halle the main difference between the new pietistic lutheran school and the orthodox lutherans arose from the pietists ' conception of christianity as chiefly consisting in a change of heart and consequent holiness of life among its greatest achievements , apart from the philanthropic institutions founded at halle , were the revival of the moravian church in 1727 by count von zinzendorf , spener 's godson and a pupil in the halle school for young noblemen , and the establishment of protestant missions many pietists maintained that the new birth always had to be preceded by agonies of repentance , and that only a regenerated theologian could teach theology these pietistic attitudes caused a counter-movement at the beginning of the 18th century ; one leader was valentin ernst löscher , superintendent at dresden as a distinct movement , pietism had its greatest strength by the middle of the 18th century ; its very individualism in fact helped to prepare the way for the enlightenment ( aufklärung ) , which took the church in an altogether different direction yet some claim that pietism contributed largely to the revival of biblical studies in germany and to making religion once more an affair of the heart and of life and not merely of the intellect it likewise gave a new emphasis to the role of the laity in the church rudolf sohm claimed that '' it was the last great surge of the waves of the ecclesiastical movement begun by the reformation ; it was the completion and the final form of the protestantism created by the reformation pietism is considered the major influence that led to the creation of the '' evangelical church of the union '' in prussia in 1817 ( many immigrants to america , who agreed with the union movement , formed german evangelical lutheran and reformed congregations , later combined into the evangelical synod of north america , which is now a part of the united church of christ ) in the middle of the 19th century , lars levi laestadius spearheaded a pietist revival in scandinavia that upheld what came to be known as laestadian lutheranism , which is heralded today by the laestadian lutheran church as well as by several congregations within mainstream lutheran churches , such as the evangelical lutheran church of finland and the church of sweden pietism was a major influence on john wesley and others who began the methodism in 18th-century great britain similar to max weber 's famous claim on the link between protestant ethic and the capitalist economy , merton argued for a similar positive correlation between the rise of protestant pietism and early experimental science halle pietists in england : anthony william boehm and the society for promoting christian knowledge an introduction to german pietism : protestant renewal at the dawn of modern europe
