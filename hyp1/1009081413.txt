between the alveolar sacs of the pellicle , most species of paramecium have closely spaced spindle-shaped trichocysts , explosive organelles that discharge thin , non-toxic filaments , often used for defensive purposes in all species , there is a deep oral groove running from the anterior of the cell to its midpoint paramecia live mainly by heterotrophy , feeding on bacteria and other small organisms the number of contractile vacuoles varies from one , to many , depending on species this ciliary method of locomotion has been found to be less than 1 % efficient to gather food , the paramecium makes movements with cilia to sweep prey organisms , along with some water , through the oral groove ( vestibulum , or vestibule ) , and into the cell some intracellular bacteria , known as kappa particles , give paramecia that have them the ability to kill other strains of paramecium that lack kappa this experiment has been cited as a possible instance of cell memory , or epigenetics in organisms with no nervous system the micronucleus is the generative , or germline nucleus , containing the genetic material that is passed along from one generation to the next fission may occur spontaneously , in the course of the vegetative cell cycle under certain conditions , it may be preceded by self-fertilization ( autogamy ) , or it may follow isogamy , a sexual phenomenon in which paramecium of compatible mating types fuse temporarily and exchange genetic material in the asexual fission phase of growth , during which cell divisions occur by mitosis rather than meiosis , clonal aging occurs leading to a gradual loss of vitality in some species , such as the well studied paramecium tetraurelia , the asexual line of clonally aging paramecia loses vitality and expires after about 200 fissions if the cells fail to undergo autogamy or conjugation these experiments indicated that the macronucleus , rather than the cytoplasm , is responsible for clonal aging thus , dna damage in the macronucleus appears to be the cause of aging in p in this single-celled protist , aging appears to proceed as it does in multicellular eukaryotes , as described in dna damage theory of aging tetraurelia are stimulated to undergo meiosis in association with either conjugation or automixis , the genetic descendants are rejuvenated , and are able to have many more mitotic binary fission divisions
