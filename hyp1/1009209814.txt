it was considered formal wear and was generally reserved for citizens there were many kinds of toga , each reserved by custom to a particular usage or social class over time , it became increasingly elaborate , and was combined with elements of the consular trabea some later roman and post-roman sources describe it as solid purple or red , either identifying or confusing it with the dress worn by the ancient roman kings ( also used to clothe images of the gods ) or reflecting changes in the trabea itself despite often extreme disparities of wealth and rank between the citizen classes , the toga identified them as a singular and exclusive civic body once a boy came of age ( usually at puberty ) he adopted the plain white toga virilis ; this meant that he was free to set up his own household , marry , and vote respectable women , the sons of freeborn men , and provincials during the early empire could hold lesser forms of citizenship ; they were protected by law but could not vote , or stand for public office togati , '' those who wear the toga , '' is not precisely equivalent to '' roman citizens , '' and may mean more broadly '' romanized '' . donning the toga transforms cincinnatus from rustic , sweaty ploughman – though a gentleman nevertheless , of impeccable stock and reputation – into rome 's leading politician , eager to serve his country ; a top-quality roman . rome 's abundant public and private statuary reinforced the notion that all rome 's great men wore togas , and must always have done so every male roman citizen was entitled to wear some kind of toga – martial refers to a lesser citizen 's '' small toga '' and a poor man 's '' little toga '' ( both togula ) , the cost of a new , simple hooded cloak , using far less material than a toga , might represent three fifths of an individual 's annual minimum subsistence cost : see most citizens who owned a toga would have cherished it as a costly material object , and worn it when they must for special occasions . rank , reputation and romanitas were paramount , even in death , so almost invariably , a male citizen 's memorial image showed him clad in his toga . despite the overwhelming quantity of roman togate portraits at every social level , and in every imaginable circumstance , at most times rome 's thoroughfares would have been with crowded with citizens and non-citizens in a variety of colourful garments , with few togas in evidence only a higher-class roman , a magistrate , would have had lictors to clear his way , and even then , wearing a toga was a challenge like the empire itself , the peace that the toga came to represent had been earned through the extraordinary and unremitting collective efforts of its citizens , who could therefore claim '' the time and dignity to dress in such a way '' a client had to be at his patron 's beck and call , to perform whatever '' togate works '' were required ; and the patron might even expect to be addressed as '' domine '' ( lord , or master ) ; a citizen-client of the equites , superior to all lesser mortals by virtue of rank and costume , might thus approach the shameful condition of dependent servitude even as a satirical analogy , the equation of togate client and slave would have shocked those who cherished the toga as a symbol of personal dignity and auctoritas – a meaning underlined during the saturnalia festival , when the toga was '' very consciously put aside '' , in a ritualised , strictly limited inversion of the master-slave relationship } } the emperor marcus aurelius , rather than wear the '' dress to which his rank entitled him '' at his own salutationes , chose to wear a plain white citizen 's toga instead ; an act of modesty for any patron , unlike caligula , who wore a triumphal toga picta or any other garment he chose , according to whim ; or nero , who caused considerable offence when he received visiting senators while dressed in a tunic embroidered with flowers , topped off with a muslin neckerchief first impressions counted ; the lawyer must present himself as a roman should : '' virile and splendid '' in his toga , with statuesque posture and '' natural good looks '' the orator 's movements should be dignified , and to the point ; he should move only as he must , to address a particular person , a particular section of the audience he should employ to good effect that subtle '' language of the hands '' for which roman oratory was famed ; no extravagant gestures , no wiggling of the shoulders , no moving '' like a dancer '' . to a great extent , the toga itself determined the orator 's style of delivery : '' we should not cover the shoulder and the whole of the throat , otherwise our dress will be unduly narrowed and will lose the impressive effect produced by breadth at the chest '' if , on the other hand , the '' toga falls down at the beginning of our speech , or when we have only proceeded but a little way , the failure to replace it is a sign of indifference , or sloth , or sheer ignorance of the way in which clothes should be worn '' . towards the end of the republic , the arch-conservative cato the younger favoured the shorter , ancient republican type of toga ; it was dark and '' scanty '' ( exigua ) , and cato wore it without tunic or shoes ; all this would have been recognised as an expression of his moral probity appian 's history of rome finds its strife-torn late republic tottering at the edge of chaos ; most seem to dress as they like , not as they ought : '' for now the roman people are much mixed with foreigners , there is equal citizenship for freedmen , and slaves dress like their masters augustus was determined to bring back '' the traditional style '' ( the toga ) he ordered that any theatre-goer in dark ( or coloured or dirty ) clothing be sent to the back seats , traditionally reserved for those who had no toga ; ordinary or common women , freedmen , low-class foreigners and slaves women could also be citizens but by the mid-to-late republican era , respectable women were stolatae ( stola-wearing ) , expected to embody and display an appropriate set of female virtues : vout cites pudicitia and fides as examples women 's adoption of the stola may have paralleled the increasing identification of the toga with citizen men , but this seems to have been a far from straightforward process meretrices might have been expected or perhaps compelled , at least in public , to wear the '' female toga '' ( toga muliebris ) . this use of the toga appears unique ; all others categorised as infamia were explicitly forbidden to wear it in this context , modern sources understand the toga – or perhaps merely the description of particular women as togata – as an instrument of inversion and realignment ; a respectable ( thus stola-clad ) woman should be demure , sexually passive , modest and obedient , morally impeccable when worn by a woman in this later era , the toga would have been a '' blatant display '' of her '' exclusion from the respectable roman hierarchy '' the romans believed that in rome 's earliest days , its military had gone to war in togas , hitching them up and back for action by using what became known as the '' gabine cinch '' . from at least the mid-republic on , the military reserved their togas for formal leisure and religious festivals ; the tunic and sagum ( heavy rectangular cloak held on the shoulder with a brooch ) were used or preferred for active duty during the early roman imperial era , members of the praetorian guard ( the emperor 's personal guard as '' first citizen '' , and a military force under his personal command ) , concealed their weapons under white , civilian-style togas when on duty in the city , offering the reassuring illusion that they represented a traditional republican , civilian authority , rather than the military arm of an imperial autocracy '' ; ; citing as the standard source ; an officiant capite velato who needed free use of both hands to perform ritual could employ the '' gabinian cincture '' ( cinctus gabinus ) , which tied the toga back . wool-working was thought a highly respectable occupation for roman women augustus was particularly proud that his wife and daughter had set the best possible example to other roman women by , allegedly , spinning and weaving his clothing to minimise waste , the smaller , old-style forms of toga may have been woven as a single , seamless , selvedged piece ; the later , larger versions may have been made from several pieces sewn together ; size seems to have counted for a lot . more cloth signified greater wealth and usually , though not invariably , higher rank . modern sources broadly agree that if made from a single piece of fabric , the toga of a high status roman in the late republic would have required a piece approximately 12 & nbsp ; ft in length ; in the imperial era , around 18 & nbsp ; ft , a third more than its predecessor , and in the late imperial era around 8 feet wide and up to 18 or 20 feet in length for the most complex , pleated forms . high-status ( consular or senatorial ) images from the late 4th century show a further ornate variation , known as the '' broad eastern toga '' ; it hung to the mid-calf , was heavily embroidered , and was worn over two pallium-style undergarments , one of which had full length sleeves . meanwhile , the office-holding aristocracy adopted ever more elaborate , complex , costly and impractical forms of toga . byzantine art show the highest functionaries of court , church and state in magnificently wrought , extravagantly exclusive court dress and priestly robes ; some at least are thought to be versions of the imperial toga
