it also functions as a signal transducer/integrator to regulate the mapk pathway , reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , as well as intracellular calcium in fact , all cells expend a large fraction of the atp they produce ( typically 30 % and up to 70 % in nerve cells ) to maintain their required cytosolic na and k concentrations recently , glycolysis has also been shown to be of particular importance for na⁺/k⁺-atpases in skeletal muscles , where inhibition of glycogen breakdown ( a substrate for glycolysis ) leads to reduced na⁺/k⁺-atpase activity and lower force production in order to maintain the cell membrane potential , cells keep a low concentration of sodium ions and high levels of potassium ions within the cell ( intracellular ) export of sodium from the cell provides the driving force for several secondary active transporters membrane transport proteins , which import glucose , amino acids , and other nutrients into the cell by use of the sodium gradient in the gut , for example , sodium is transported out of the reabsorbing cell on the blood ( interstitial fluid ) side via the na⁺-k⁺ pump , whereas , on the reabsorbing ( lumenal ) side , the na⁺-glucose symporter uses the created na⁺ gradient as a source of energy to import both na⁺ and glucose , which is far more efficient than simple diffusion a cell 's osmolarity is the sum of the concentrations of the various ion species and many proteins and other organic compounds inside the cell furthermore , when the cell begins to swell , this automatically activates the na⁺-k⁺ pump because it changes the internal concentrations of na⁺-k⁺ to which the pump is sensitive within the last decade , many independent labs have demonstrated that , in addition to the classical ion transporting , this membrane protein can also relay extracellular ouabain-binding signalling into the cell through regulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation this causes the dephosphorylation of the pump , reverting it to its previous conformational state , thus releasing the k⁺ ions into the cell for instance , na⁺/k⁺-atpase found in the membrane of heart cells is an important target of cardiac glycosides ( for example digoxin and ouabain ) , inotrope drugs used to improve heart performance by increasing its force of contraction according to the blaustein-hypothesis , this carrier enzyme ( na⁺/ca²⁺ exchanger , ncx ) uses the na gradient generated by the na⁺-k⁺ pump to remove ca²⁺ from the intracellular space , hence slowing down the na⁺-k⁺ pump results in a permanently elevated ca²⁺ level in the muscle , which may be the mechanism of the long-term inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides such as digoxin the problem with this hypothesis is that at pharmacological concentrations of digitalis , less than 5 % of na/k-atpase molecules—specifically the α2 isoform in heart and arterial smooth muscle ( k d 32 nm ) -- are inhibited , not enough to affect the intracellular concentration of na⁺ however , apart from the population of na/k-atpase in the plasma membrane—responsible for ion transport -- , there is another population in the caveolae which acts as digitalis receptor and stimulates the egf receptor a commonly used inhibitor used in the treatment of cardiac disease would be digoxin which essentially binds '' to the extracellular part of enzyme i.e that binds potassium , when it is in a phosphorylated state , to transfer potassium inside the cell '' after this essential binding occurs , a dephosphorylation of the alpha subunit occurs which reduces the effect of cardiac disease it is via the inhibiting of the na+/k+-atpase that sodium levels will begin to increase within the cell which ultimately increases the concentration of intracellular calcium via the sodium-calcium exchanger
