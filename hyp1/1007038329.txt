vespers , also called evening prayer , takes place as dusk begins to fall evening prayer gives thanks for the day just past and makes an evening sacrifice of praise to god ( psalm 141:1 ) the general structure of the roman rite catholic service of vespers is as follows : vespers opens with the singing or chanting of the words deus , in adiutorium meum intende ) the appointed hymn ( from the hymnarium ) is then sung ; the appointed psalmody is then sung : in the liturgy in general use since 1970 there are two psalms and a new testament canticle , while in the divine office , older forms of the roman rite , five psalms are sung instead ( not quite the same five before and after the reform of the roman breviary by pope pius x ) additionally , most psalms also have a short caption explaining how the psalm/canticle relates to the church in a christological or spiritual way ; lastly , english translations oftentimes have a psalm-prayer said after the gloria and before the antiphon the preces ( intercessory prayers ) are then said ( in the post-1970 roman rite ) , followed by the our father , and then the closing prayer ( oratio ) and final blessing/invocation great vespers is used on sundays and major feast days ( those when the polyeleos is prescribed at matins ) when it may be celebrated alone or as part of an all-night vigil , as well as on a handful of special days e.g , good friday and pascha afternoon ; on certain days of strict fasting it also commences the divine liturgy small vespers is a very abbreviated form used only on the afternoon before a vigil and is redundant to the subsequent great vespers , being a placeholder between the ninth hour and compline and is seldom used except in monasteries , where the vigil can last all night since the liturgical day begins at sunset , vespers is a day 's first service and its hymns introduce the day 's themes the general structure of the service is as follows ( psalm numbers are according to the septuagint ) : vespers opens with a blessing by the priest and then '' come , let us worship '' ; when part of an all-night vigil , the blessing that normally begins matins is used ; when part of the divine liturgy , the blessing that is part thereof is used the ektenia ( also called the '' litany of peace '' ) a selection of psalms , called a kathisma is sung on feast days , there are three or more readings from the old testament , called paroemia ( '' parables '' ) these are verses that teach about the feast day ( or on a saturday evening , christ 's resurrection ) , christmas eve , the annunciation when it falls on a weekday of great lent , or holy saturday , vespers is joined to the divine liturgy , functioning in place of the typica as the framework of the hymns of the liturgy of the catechumens after the readings from the old testament , the trisagion is chanted , followed by the epistle and gospel , and the divine liturgy proceeds normally from that point on these occasions , as at other times when the gospel is read at vespers , the little entrance is made with the gospel book instead of the censer the liturgy of the presanctified gifts always is similarly combined with vespers , with the first half of vespers ( up to and including the old testament readings ) making up a significant portion of the service ” vespers is the only service in the armenian daily office other than the morning service which has hymns proper to the commemoration , feast , or tone assigned to it : a vespers hymn after psalm 142 ( or after gladsome light if it is appointed for the day ) and the “ lifting-up hymn ” after psalm 121 ) ” ; psalm 55:17 “ i waited for my god ” ; “ blessing and glory.now and always.amen ) ” vespers hymn ( varies ) at sunday vespers ( saturday night ) : proclamation : “ let us all say ) ” otherwise continue here : prayer : “ hear our voices ) ” ; “ holy god ” hymn after psalm 121 ( varies ) ; proclamation : “ for the peace of the whole world ) ” ; proclamation ; prayer on fasting days and lenten days which are not sundays ( saturday evenings ) , continue here : the prayer of manasseh ; “ glory to the father.now and always.amen ” ; exhortation ; proclamation ; prayer ; “ remember your ministers ) ” on sundays ( saturday evenings ) and during the 50 days of easter : psalm 134 : “ now bless the lord , all you servants of the lord ) ” on sundays : prayer : “ king of peace ) ” on feasts of the cross : proclamation : “ by the holy cross in the coptic orthodox church , vespers refers to a series of services : the vespers prayer - this is taken from the book of hours the vespers raising of incense vespers , as a whole , is an introduction and preparation for the liturgy , consisting of a collection of prayers , praises and thanksgiving prayers which request the lord 's blessings upon the sacramental service ) the lord 's prayer the rite of vespers raising of incense in the coptic orthodox church is as follows : the thanksgiving prayer - as with all coptic orthodox services , vespers first thanks god '' for everything , concerning everything , and in everything '' minor circuit of incense and three inaudible litanies the verses of the cymbals the litany for the departed major circuit of incense graciously accord o lord the trisagion the doxologies - commemorating the saints of the church and the liturgical season of the church the creed the prayer of ⲫⲛⲟⲩϯ ⲛⲁⲓ ⲛⲁⲛ ( o god have mercy upon us in the indian orthodox church , vespers ( ramsho ) is one of the canonical hours given in the shehimo there are prescribed forms of the service in the anglican prayer book the liturgy of the liberal catholic church daily office books that conform to the historic structure of vespers have also been published by the pilgrim press ( the new century hymnal ) and westminster john knox press ( book of common worship daily prayer ) in addition , during the 19th and early 20th centuries , synagogues in the classical reform tradition sometimes referred to their friday evening worship services as '' vespers '' from the time of the early church , the practice of fixed prayer times have been taught ; in apostolic tradition , hippolytus instructed christians to pray seven times a day '' on rising , at the lighting of the evening lamp , at bedtime , at midnight '' and '' the third , sixth and ninth hours of the day , being hours associated with christ 's passion vespers is , therefore , together with vigil , the most ancient office known in the church the '' peregrinatio '' , the date of which is probably the 4th century , gives the liturgical order as practised at jerusalem vespers , then , was the most solemn office of the day and was composed of the psalms called lucernales ( psalm 140 is called psalmus lucernalis by the apostolic constitutions ) then two lessons were read as at vigils , one from the old , and the other from the new testament in the sixth century the office of vespers in the latin church was almost the same as it has been throughout the middle ages and up to the present day in a document of unquestionable authority of that period the office is described as follows : the evening hour , or vespertina synaxis , is composed of four psalms , a capitulum , a response , a hymn , a versicle , a canticle from the gospel , litany ( kyrie ) , pater with the ordinary finale , oratio , or prayer , and dismissal ( rule of st this disposition is almost the same as that of the '' ordo romanus '' , except that the number of psalms recited is five instead of four like the other hours , therefore , vespers is divided into two parts ; the psalmody , or singing of the psalms , forming the first part , and the capitulum and formulæ the second the reason of this is that st benedict introduced in the cursus , another hour—that of compline—which was prescribed to be celebrated in the evening , and which might be considered as a kind of doubling of the office of lucernarium there is an entire rearrangement of the psalms ( see reform of the roman breviary by pope pius x ) with new ones appointed for each day of the week on feasts which are doubles of the second class and a fortiori of the first class , as well as on feasts of the blessed virgin mary , the holy angels , and apostles , the psalms are proper to the feast as heretofore the hymn , which varies according to season and feast , is sung , followed by its versicle and response in the same manner as the night is consecrated to god by the office of the vigil , so also is the end of the day by vespers this place of honour accorded so persistently to the magnificat from such remote antiquity is but one of the many , and of the least striking , proofs of the devotion which has always been paid to the blessed virgin mary in the church the series of hymns consecrated to vespers in the roman breviary also form a class apart and help to give us some hints as to the symbolism of this hour the celebrant then sings the chapter , after which all return to their places agni parthene blazhen muzh jewish services ma'ariv/arvit ( evening prayers ) maghrib prayer ( equivalent islamic prayer at sunset ) ramsha sacred music the text of vespers for today 's date ( roman catholic ) the roman catholic general instruction for the liturgy of the hours an explanation of first vespers vespers in the orthodox church sunday vespers in latin and with gregorian chant ( ordinary form of the roman rite ) an order for methodist evening prayer ( pdf ) byzantine catholic archeparchy of pittsburgh
