in general , hydrogen sulfide acts as a reducing agent , especially in the presence of base , which forms sh − this reaction is exploited in the claus process , an important industrial method to dispose of hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide is slightly soluble in water and acts as a weak acid ( pk a & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 6.9 in 0.01–0.1 & nbsp ; mol/litre solutions at 18 & nbsp ; °c ) , giving the hydrosulfide ion ( also written by substituting a small part of sulfur with phosphorus and using even higher pressures , it has been predicted that it may be possible to raise the critical temperature to above and achieve room-temperature superconductor hydrogen sulfide is most commonly obtained by its separation from sour gas , which is natural gas with a high content of aluminium sulfide , phosphorus pentasulfide , silicon disulfide liberate hydrogen sulfide upon exposure to water : :6 & nbsp ; h 2 o + al 2 s 3 → 3 & nbsp ; h 2 s + 2 & nbsp ; al ( oh ) 3 this gas is also produced by heating sulfur with solid organic compounds and by reducing sulfurated organic compounds with hydrogen this is due to providing a warm environment sustainable for sulfur bacteria and maintaining the reaction which interacts between sulfate in the water and the water heater anode , which is usually made from magnesium metal hydrogen sulfide is also known to increase the levels of glutathione which acts to reduce or disrupt ros levels in cells the components of the resulting precipitate redissolve with some selectivity , and are thus identified catalysts used in hydrodesulfurization are routinely activated with hydrogen sulfide , and the behavior of metallic catalysts used in other parts of a refining is also modified using hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide is used to separate deuterium oxide , or heavy water , from normal water via the girdler sulfide process scientists from the university of exeter discovered that cell exposure to small amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas can prevent mitochondrial damage when the cell is stressed with disease , enzymes are drawn into the cell to produce small amounts of hydrogen sulfide a suspended animation-like state has been induced in rodents with the use of hydrogen sulfide , resulting in hypothermia with a concomitant reduction in metabolic rate in addition , hydrogen sulfide has been shown to reduce inflammation in various situations image : deposit from hydrogen sulphide.jpg thumb deposit of sulfur on a rock , caused by volcanic gas small amounts of hydrogen sulfide occur in crude petroleum , but natural gas can contain up to 30 % hydrogen sulfide can be present naturally in well water , often as a result of the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria hydrogen sulfide is created by the human body in small doses through bacterial breakdown of proteins containing sulfur in the intestinal tract , therefore it contributes to the characteristic odor of flatulence the resulting is converted to elemental sulfur by partial combustion via the claus process , which is a major source of elemental sulfur arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes in contact with organic material , especially at high temperatures depending on environmental conditions , it is responsible for deterioration of material through the action of some sulfur oxidizing microorganisms in landfill , the burial of organic matter rapidly leads to the production of anaerobic digestion within the waste mass and , with the humid atmosphere and relatively high temperature that accompanies biodegradation , biogas is produced as soon as the air within the waste mass has been reduced these bacteria can not survive in air but the moist , warm , anaerobic conditions of buried waste that contains a high source of carbon & ndash ; in inert landfills , paper and glue used in the fabrication of products such as drywall can provide a rich source of carbon & ndash ; is an excellent environment for the formation of hydrogen sulfide a number of processes have been designed to remove hydrogen sulfide from drinking water hydrogen sulfide is commonly found in raw natural gas and biogas it is typically removed by amine gas treating technologies in such processes , the hydrogen sulfide is first converted to an ammonium salt , whereas the natural gas is unaffected hydrogen sulfide generated in this process is typically converted to elemental sulfur using the claus process image : aminetreating.png frame center process flow diagram of a typical amine treating process used in petroleum refineries , natural gas processing plants and other industrial facilities hydrogen sulfide is a broad-spectrum poison , meaning that it can poison several different systems in the body , although the nervous system is most affected since hydrogen sulfide occurs naturally in the body , the environment , and the gut , enzymes exist to detoxify it hence , low levels of hydrogen sulfide may be tolerated indefinitely these effects are believed to be due to the fact that hydrogen sulfide combines with alkali present in moist surface tissues to form sodium sulfide , a caustic a valve to a pipe that carried chicken manure , straw and gypsum to the compost fuel for the mushroom growing operation became clogged , and as workers unclogged the valve in a confined space without proper ventilation the hydrogen sulfide that had built up due to anaerobic decomposition of the material was released , poisoning the workers in the surrounding area as organic matter decays under low-oxygen ( or hypoxic ) conditions ( such as in swamps , eutrophic lakes or dead zones of oceans ) , sulfate-reducing bacteria will use the sulfates present in the water to oxidize the organic matter , producing hydrogen sulfide as waste in this model of the origin of life on earth , geologically produced hydrogen sulfide is postulated as an electron donor driving the reduction of carbon dioxide in the deep sea , hydrothermal vents and cold seeps with high levels of hydrogen sulfide are home to a number of extremely specialized lifeforms , ranging from bacteria to fish the formation of may have been initiated by massive volcanic eruptions , which emitted carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere , which warmed the oceans , lowering their capacity to absorb oxygen that would otherwise oxidize the increased levels of hydrogen sulfide could have killed oxygen-generating plants as well as depleted the ozone layer , causing further stress
