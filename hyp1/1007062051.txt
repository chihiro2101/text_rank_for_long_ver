by the end of the war , there were only nine domestic airlines remaining , eight smaller regional concerns and australian national airways ( ana ) , a conglomerate owned by british and australian shipping interests which had a virtual monopoly on the major trunk routes and received 85 % of all government air transport subsidies air transport , the government believed , was primarily a public service , like hospitals , the railways or the post office in august 1945 , only two days after the end of world war ii , the australian parliament passed the australian national airways bill , which set up the australian national airways commission ( anac ) and charged it with the task of reconstructing the nation 's air transport industry from this time on , it seemed , air transport in

new airline off to a flying start by selling his entire operation to the anac as a going concern , including ( if desired ) his own services as managing agent a dozen more dc-3s would be added over the next few months , all ex-royal australian air force aircraft originally bought by the australian government under lend-lease his first task was to travel to the united states to accept delivery of the dc-4s he later wrote : : to my utter astonishment arthur coles , after the expected pep-talk about the dc-4 assignment , said he was relying on me to find out what new equipment was being developed that would enable us to offer our passengers a better product than our established rival , at a competitive price a major factor in the success of the government airline was the wise choice of aircraft east-coast services were continually expanded and taa soon earned its title as a true 'trans australian ' airline with services to perth on the west coast of the continent , using douglas dc-4 aircraft the controversial two airlines policy was introduced and effectively seriously limited growth and expansion opportunities for the airlines without government approval the policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft ( one from each airline ) were required on their delivery flights to enter australian airspace at exactly the same time taa takes over australian

travel the federal government , although technically having deregulated the domestic aviation sector , made it effectively impossible for new entrant compass airlines to succeed in 1987 , the hawke government announced that the then government-owned domestic air terminals would be effectively privatised and leased to the two domestic airlines any third airline operating there had to make do with the regional airline facilities the ambitious new airline was allocated by the government what were clearly the worst gates , in the least desirable sections of domestic terminals across the country ( in some cases , atco huts were used ) and had to operate from the international terminal at perth airport as the result of liens placed over the compass aircraft ( due to alleged non-payment of airways expenses ) , the government 's civil aviation authority effectively caused the shutting down of compass on 20 december 1991 , 5 days before what would have been the immensely profitable christmas travel period airservices australia v canadian airlines international ltd a seemingly well-orchestrated plan saw the compass aircraft quickly flown out of the country and , with them , potentially the demise of a truly deregulated domestic aviation sector although the merger with qantas was seen as inevitable to give the latter a domestic network — and revive its bottom line — many former staff of australian airlines ( taa ) and the general public mourned the loss of this iconic australian brand although compass was controversially and perhaps inevitably forced out of business , australian 's days , and those of ansett , were numbered : the decision had been made at the federal government level to offer both government-owned carriers ( qantas and australian ) for sale australian airlines was offered first but was quickly snapped up by qantas , which offered 400m to purchase the domestic carrier qantas then decided to merge the airline into its network ; subsequently the government offered the entire merged operation in a public float , after selling a cornerstone 25 % stake to british airways , thus returning qantas to the stock market after being
