thumb the vikings ( or norsemen ) began carrying out raids on gaelic ireland in the late eighth century , and over the following few decades they founded a number of settlements along the coast from the time of the seventh century and the reign of domnall mac áedo , the kingship of tara was a title which was strongly associated with the high king of ireland and was held by members of the uí néill dynasty , who controlled the northern half of ireland máel sechnaill responded by attacking munster in 999 , and over the following years the two kings struggled for supremacy in ireland he marched on tara in 1000 with the combined armies of munster , osraige , leinster , and dublin , but after an advance party consisting of the latter two groups was destroyed by máel sechnaill , brian boru withdrew from the area without giving battle he completed the task when , following '' a great hosting.by land and sea '' into the uí néill territory of cenél conaill in 1011 , the king was brought south to dál gcais territory to submit to brian boru in person at his royal site of cenn corad he lost two hundred men including his son flann sigtrygg then sent a fleet along the coast to attack the munster town of cork , but that was defeated , and sigtrygg 's nephew was killed brian brought his army to leinster in 1013 , and camped outside dublin from september until the end of the year according to the icelandic njáls saga , sigtrygg promised both men the kingship of ireland if they defeated brian no order of battle is given in the contemporary sources ; the only leaders named are those who died in the battle 175 , 181–84 no notables from meath are recorded among the slain ; leading to the suggestion that , if present , máel sechnaill kept himself and his forces out of harm 's way but the annals of ulster say that máel sechnaill and brian rode together to dublin , and the annals of the four masters go so far as to say that it was máel sechnaill who won the day , and completed the rout after the death of brian 185 , 191 on the other hand , cogad gáedel re gallaib ( '' the war of the irish with the foreigners '' ) , says that the men of meath came to the muster with brian , but '' were not faithful to him '' the front line of the dublin-leinster forces were the foreign vikings , led by brodir , sigurd , and a man called plait , described as '' the bravest knight of all the foreigners '' behind them again came the leinstermen , headed by máel mórda after the connachta came máel sechnaill and the men of meath , but ( the cogad says ) he had made an agreement with the men of dublin that if he would not attack them , they would not attack him 166–69 the battle opened with plait taunting domnall mac eimín , a scottish ally of brian 209–10 brian 's son murchad , at the head of the dál gcais army , took on the foreign vikings and , according to the cogad , he himself killed 100 of the enemy—fifty with the sword in his right hand and fifty with the sword in his left 215–17 it was at this point that brian 's grandson toirdelbach was killed 109–10 máel sechnaill was restored as high king of ireland , and remained secure in his position until his death in 1022 111 though the annals imply that life was not much changed after the death of brian boru , it created a succession crisis , as brian 's son and heir murchad had died as well in 1052 , diarmait mac máel na mbó , king of leinster , captured dublin and fine gall , for the first time asserting irish overlordship over the norse of ireland the standard view , and the '' popular '' view , is that the battle ended a war between the irish and vikings by which brian boru broke viking power in ireland however revisionist historians see it as an irish civil war in which brian boru 's munster and its allies defeated leinster and dublin , and that there were vikings fighting on both sides
