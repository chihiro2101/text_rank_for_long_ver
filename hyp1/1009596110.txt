marshes provide a habitat for many species of plants , animals , and insects that have adapted to living in flooded conditions marshes have extremely high levels of biological production , some of the highest in the world , and therefore are important in supporting fisheries saltwater marshes are found around the world in mid to high latitudes , wherever there are sections of protected coastline they are located close enough to the shoreline that the motion of the tides affects them , and , sporadically , they are covered with water although considered a freshwater marsh , this form of marsh is affected by the ocean tides however , without the stresses of salinity at work in its saltwater counterpart , the diversity of the plants and animals that live in and use freshwater tidal marshes is much higher than in salt marshes ranging greatly in both size and geographic location , freshwater marshes make up the most common form of wetland in north america they are also the most diverse of the three types of marsh some examples of freshwater marsh types in north america are : they also occur on the edges of large lakes and rivers wet meadows often have very high plant diversity and high densities of buried seeds great lakes vegetation dynamics : the role of fluctuating water levels and buried seeds in western north america , vernal pools tend to form in open grasslands , bauder , e similar temporary ponds occur in other world ecosystems , where they may have local names playa lakes are a form of shallow freshwater marsh that occurs in the southern high plains of the united states many kinds of marsh occur along the fringes of large rivers some areas of the world have already lost 90 % of their wetlands , including marshes restoration can be done on a large scale , such as by allowing rivers to flood naturally in the spring , or on a small scale by returning wetlands to urban landscapes
