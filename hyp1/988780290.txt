in cantilever bridges , the cantilevers are usually built as pairs , with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section temporary cantilevers are often used in construction therefore , some truss arch bridges ( see navajo bridge ) are built from each side as cantilevers until the spans reach each other and are then jacked apart to stress them in compression before finally joining nearly all cable-stayed bridges are built using cantilevers as this is one of their chief advantages this type of construction lends itself well to balanced cantilever construction where the bridge is built in both directions from a single support the roof built over the stands at old trafford uses a cantilever so that no supports will block views of the field 1 july 2005 less obvious examples of cantilevers are free-standing ( vertical ) radio towers without guy-wires , and chimneys , which resist being blown over by the wind through cantilever action at their base image : pierre pflimlin bridge uc adjusted.jpg this concrete bridge temporarily functions as a set of two balanced cantilevers during construction - with further cantilevers jutting out to support formwork the end fixed rigidly to the central fuselage is known as the root and the far end as the tip to resist horizontal shear stresses from either drag or engine thrust , the wing must also form a stiff cantilever in the horizontal plane a single-spar design will usually be fitted with a second smaller drag-spar nearer the trailing edge , braced to the main spar via additional internal members or a stressed skin cantilever wings require much stronger and heavier spars than would otherwise be needed in a wire-braced design however , as the speed of the aircraft increases , the drag of the bracing increases sharply , while the wing structure must be strengthened , typically by increasing the strength of the spars and the thickness of the skinning increases in engine power through the late 1920s and early 1930s raised speeds through this zone and by the late 1930s cantilever wings had almost wholly superseded braced ones the challenge for their practical application lies in the square and cubic dependences of cantilever performance specifications on dimensions a cantilever rack is a type of warehouse storage system consisting of the vertical column , the base , the arms , and the horizontal and/or cross-bracing the horizontal and/or cross bracing are used to connect two or more columns together
