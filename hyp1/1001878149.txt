gradually soil is able to support higher forms of plants and animals , starting with pioneer species , and proceeding to more complex soil food web soils deepen with accumulation of humus primarily due to the activities of higher plants this development of layers is the beginning of the soil profile they are : parent material , climate , topography ( relief ) , organisms , and time generally , minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the earth 's mantle are less resistant to weathering , while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material , because physical , chemical , and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation the solution of salts in water results from the action of bipolar water molecules on ionic salt compounds producing a solution of ions and water , removing those minerals and reducing the rock 's integrity , at a rate depending on water flow and pore channels chemical weathering becomes more effective as the surface area of the rock increases , thus is favoured by physical disintegration temperature and moisture both influence the organic matter content of soil through their effects on the balance between primary production and decomposition : the colder or drier the climate the lesser atmospheric carbon is fixed as organic matter while the lesser organic matter is decomposed climate is the dominant factor in soil formation , and soils show the distinctive characteristics of the climate zones in which they form , with a feedback to climate through transfer of carbon stocked in soil horizons back to the atmosphere if warm temperatures and abundant water are present in the profile at the same time , the processes of weathering , leaching , and plant growth will be maximized the seasonal rainfall distribution , evaporative losses , site topography , and soil permeability interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation likewise , a deficiency of water is a major factor in determining the characteristics of soils of dry regions the direct influences of climate include : a shallow accumulation of lime in low rainfall areas as caliche formation of acid soils in humid areas erosion of soils on steep hillsides deposition of eroded materials downstream very intense chemical weathering , leaching , and erosion in warm and humid regions where soil does not freeze climate directly affects the rate of weathering and leaching wind moves sand and smaller particles ( dust ) , especially in arid regions where there is little plant cover , depositing it close or far from the entrainment source the type and amount of precipitation influence soil formation by affecting the movement of ions and particles through the soil , and aid in the development of different soil profiles climate also indirectly influences soil formation through the effects of vegetation cover and biological activity , which modify the rates of chemical reactions in the soil steep slopes encourage rapid soil loss by erosion and allow less rainfall to enter the soil before running off and hence , little mineral deposition in lower profiles in semiarid regions , the lower effective rainfall on steeper slopes also results in less complete vegetative cover , so there is less plant contribution to soil formation in swales and depressions where runoff water tends to concentrate , the regolith is usually more deeply weathered and soil profile development is more advanced these patterns emerge from topographic differences in erosion , deposition , fertility , soil moisture , plant cover , other soil biology , fire-history , and exposure to the elements plants hold soil against erosion , and accumulated plant material build soil humus levels soil animals , including soil macrofauna and soil mesofauna , mix soils as they form burrows and pores , allowing moisture and gases to move about , a process called bioturbation plants with deep taproots can penetrate many metres through the different soil layers to bring up nutrients from deeper in the profile humans impact soil formation by removing vegetation cover with erosion , waterlogging , lateritization or podzolization ( according to climate and topography ) as the result their tillage also mixes the different soil layers , restarting the soil formation process as less weathered material is mixed with the more developed upper layers , resulting in net increased rate of mineral weathering other important functions are fulfilled by earthworms in the soil ecosystem , in particular their intense mucus production , both within the intestine and as a lining in their galleries , exert a organic matter on soil microflora , giving them the status of ecosystem engineers , which they share with ants and termites termites and ants may also retard soil profile development by denuding large areas of soil around their nests , leading to increased loss of soil by erosion plants shade soils , keeping them cooler and slow evaporation of soil moisture , or conversely , by way of transpiration , plants can cause soils to lose moisture , resulting in complex and highly variable relationships between leaf area index ( measuring light interception ) and moisture loss : more generally plants prevent soil from desiccation during driest months while they dry it during moister months , thereby acting as a buffer against strong moisture variation the type and amount of vegetation depends on climate , topography , soil characteristics and biological factors , mediated or not by human activities soil factors such as density , depth , chemistry , ph , temperature and moisture greatly affect the type of plants that can grow in a given location there , organisms feed on them and mix the organic material with the upper soil layers ; these added organic compounds become part of the soil formation process man can import , or extract , nutrients and energy in ways that dramatically change soil formation in more recent times , human destruction of natural vegetation and subsequent tillage of the soil for crop production has abruptly modified soil formation likewise , irrigation soil in an arid region drastically influences soil-forming factors , as does adding fertilizer and lime to soils of low fertility this outcome was not anticipated because the antecedent prairie fire ecology capable of producing these distinct deep rich black soils is not easily observed while a mixture of sand , silt and clay constitute the texture of a soil and the aggregation of those components produces peds , the development of a distinct b horizon marks the development of a soil or pedogenesis for example , recently deposited material from a flood exhibits no soil development as there has not been enough time for the material to form a structure that further defines soil he demonstrated this in 1898 using the soil forming equation : : s soil formation cl ( sometimes c ) climate o organisms ( soil microbiology , soil mesofauna , soil biology ) r relief p parent material t time this is often remembered with the mnemonic clorpt soil mixing ( pedoturbation ) is often an important factor in soil formation transported constituents are deposited due to differences in soil moisture and soil chemistry , especially soil ph and redox potential a variety of mechanisms contribute to soil formation , including siltation , erosion , overpressure and lake bed succession
