every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device color-managed software then uses these standardized profiles to translate color from one device to another to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as srgb ; when such calibration is done well enough , no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space it makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device by ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see , this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices in nearly every translation process , we have to deal with the fact that the color gamut of different devices vary in range which makes an accurate reproduction impossible color management : color space conversion , cambridge in color icc specification icc.1:2010 before the actual rendering intent is carried out , one can temporarily simulate the rendering by soft proofing it is a useful tool as it predicts the outcome of the colors and is available as an application in many color management systems : in practice , photographers almost always use relative or perceptual intent , as for natural images , absolute causes color cast , while saturation produces unnatural colors color matching module ( also -method or -system ) is a software algorithm that adjusts the numerical values that get sent to or received from different devices so that the perceived color they produce remains consistent the key issue here is how to deal with a color that can not be reproduced on a certain device in order to show it through a different device as if it were visually the same color , just as when the reproducible color range between color transparencies and printed matters are different macos has added automatic color management ( assuming srgb for most things ) automatically in the os , and applications have to work around this to provide more accurate color management operating systems that use the x window system for graphics can use icc profiles , and support for linux color management , still less mature than on other platforms , is coordinated through openicc at freedesktop.org and makes use of littlecms some image software ( such as photoshop ) perform automatic color separation to maintain color information in cmyk mode using a specified icc profile such as us web coated ( swop ) v2
