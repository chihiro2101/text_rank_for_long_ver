waypoints have only become widespread for navigational use by the layman since the development of advanced navigational systems , such as the global positioning system ( gps ) and certain other types of radio navigation for example , artificial airways '' highways in the sky '' , created specifically for purposes of air navigation , often have no clear connection to features of the real world , and consist only of a series of abstract waypoints in the sky through which pilots navigate ; these airways are designed to facilitate air traffic control and routing of traffic between heavily traveled locations , and do not reference natural terrain features abstract waypoints typically have only specified longitude and latitude or utm coordinates plus the reference data , and often a name if they are marked on charts , and are located using a radio navigation system such as a vor or gps receiver gps systems are increasingly used to create and use waypoints in navigation of all kinds in gps navigation , a '' route '' is usually defined as a series of two or more waypoints many gps receivers , both military and civilian , now offer integrated cartography databases ( also known as base maps ) , allowing users to locate a point on a map and define it as a waypoint some gps systems intended for automobile navigation can generate a suggested driving route between two waypoints , based on the cartographic database these references comprise the national airspace system 's method of allowing air traffic to select routes that yield efficient point-to-point navigation a notable example is the worldwide use , in orienteering sports , of waypoints with a map that omits a coordinate system , known as control points for visual air navigation ( see the article on visual flight rules ) , waypoints may be directly associated with distinctive features on the ground that are easily identifiable from aircraft , such as stadiums , power plants , racetracks , etc in aviation , area navigation ( rnav ) —a method of navigation that permits aircraft operation on any desired flight path within the coverage of station-referenced navigation aids or within the limits of the capability of self-contained aids , or a combination of these—relies heavily upon waypoints waypoints may be a simple named point in space or may be associated with existing navigational aids , intersections , or fixes
