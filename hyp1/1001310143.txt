she hears the young man approaching on his bicycle and casts aside the book she was reading ( revealing a reproduction of vermeer 's the lacemaker ) the young man appears near the door the crowd clears when the policeman places the hand in the box previously carried by the young man and gives it to the young woman the young man and the young woman watch these events unfold from the apartment window the young man is roused from his rest by the sound of a door-buzzer ringing ( represented visually by a martini shaker being shaken by a set of arms through two holes in a wall ) the young woman goes to answer the door and does not return the second young man forces the first one to throw away his nun 's clothing and then makes him stand with his face to the wall , as if in disgrace we see the second young man 's face for the first time ( and discover that he is also played by pierre batcheff ) as he admires the art supplies and books on the table near the wall and forces the first young man to hold two of the books as he stares at the wall the first young man eventually shoots the second young man when the books abruptly turn into revolvers the second young man , now in a meadow , dies while swiping at the back of a nude female figure which suddenly disappears into thin air subsequently , the first young man makes the young woman 's armpit hair attach itself to where his mouth would be on his face through gestures the young woman looks at the first young man with disgust , and leaves the apartment sticking her tongue out at him he shows her the time on his watch and they walk near the rocks , where they find the remnants of the first young man 's nun 's clothing and the box however , the film abruptly cuts to the final shot with a title card reading '' in spring '' , showing the couple buried in beach sand up to their elbows , motionless and perhaps dead the title of the film is a hidden reminiscence from the spanish saying : '' the andalusian dog howls-someone has died ! ” the screenplay was written in a few days ” in deliberate contrast to the approach taken by jean epstein and his peers , which was to never leave anything in their work to chance , with every aesthetic decision having a rational explanation and fitting clearly into the whole , buñuel made clear throughout his writings that , between dalí and himself , the only rule for the writing of the script was : '' no idea or image that might lend itself to a rational explanation of any kind would be accepted '' he also stated : '' nothing , in the film , symbolizes anything however , in an interview in 1975 or '76 , buñuel claimed that he had used a dead calf 's eye during the bicycle scene , the woman who is sitting on a chair , reading , throws the book aside when she notices the man who has fallen in buñuel 's original script , the final shot was to feature the corpses of the man and woman '' consumed by swarms of flies '' however , this special effect was modified due to budget limitations , with the film ending with a still shot of the man and woman , who had been walking in the previous beach scene , half-buried in the sand and apparently dead buñuel since claimed that prior to the show , he had put stones in his pockets '' to throw at the audience in case of disaster '' , although others had no recollection of this '' against his hopes and expectations , the film was a huge success amongst the french bourgeoisie , leading buñuel to exclaim in exasperation , '' what can i do about the people who adore all that is new , even when it goes against their deepest convictions , or about the insincere , corrupt press , and the inane herd that saw beauty or poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate impassioned call for murder ? '' after its '' triumphant premiere '' , un chien andalou was bought by the owner of '' studio-28 '' dalí stated that the theme of the new film was to parallel that of the first : '' to present the straight and pure 'conduct ' of someone who continues to pursue love despite wretched humanitarian ideals , patriotism and the other poor mechanisms of reality
