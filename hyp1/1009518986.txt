'' due to the exponential rate of increase , at any point in the chain reaction 99 % of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations it is a reasonable approximation to think of the first 53 generations as a latency period leading up to the actual explosion , which only takes 3â€“4 generations time , computer memory ) for only a constant increase in problem size this kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes , often between 30 and 100 items ( most computer algorithms need to be able to solve much larger problems , up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times , something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm ) also , the effects of moore 's law do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely allows you to increase the problem size by a constant if a slow processor can solve problems of size x in time t , then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size x + constant in the same time t with media such as social networks , one person can forward the same content to many people simultaneously , who then spread it to even more people , and so on , causing rapid spread in the most extreme case , when growth increases without bound in finite time , it is called hyperbolic growth in reality , initial exponential growth is often not sustained forever for example , population growth may reach an upper limit due to resource limitations exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions , as unbounded growth is not physically realistic although growth may initially be exponential , the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored negative feedback factors become significant ( leading to a logistic growth model ) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model , such as continuity or instantaneous feedback , break down ( from swirski , 2006 ) the second half of the chessboard is the time when an exponentially growing influence is having a significant economic impact on an organization 's overall business strategy french children are offered a riddle , which shows an aspect of exponential growth : '' the apparent suddenness with which an exponentially growing quantity approaches a fixed limit '' on the possible reasons for the hyperexponential growth of the earth population
