originally , klezmer referred to musical instruments , and was later extended to refer , as a pejorative , to musicians themselves it was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as '' yiddish '' music , although it is also sometimes called freilech music ( yiddish , literally '' happy music '' ) the first recordings to use the term '' klezmer '' to refer to the music were the klezmorim 's east side wedding and streets of gold in 1977/78 , followed by andy statman and zev feldman 's jewish klezmer music in 1979 a number of dreydlekh ( a yiddish word for ornament ( music ) ) , such as krekhts ( '' sobs '' ) are used to produce this style klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g the bible has several descriptions of orchestras and levites making music , but after the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce , many rabbis discouraged musical instruments it is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century bessarabia , where the bulk of today 's traditional repertoire was written klezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue , in particular hazzan music the first musician to play klezmer in european concerts , josef gusikov , played a type of xylophone which he invented and called a '' wood and straw instrument '' in the 1920s , clarinetists dave tarras and naftule brandwein caused a brief , influential revival , but hankus netsky has noted that '' few of the performers of this era actually referred to themselves as klezmorim , and the term is found nowhere in any jewish instrumental recording of the time '' american klezmer p.16-17 ( the soprano isa kremer was a popular exponent of yiddish song internationally during the first half of the 20th century ; notably making several recordings with columbia records and appearing often at carnegie hall and other major venues in the u.s while traditional performances may have been on the decline , many jewish composers who had mainstream success , such as leonard bernstein and aaron copland , continued to be influenced by the klezmeric idioms heard during their youth ( as gustav mahler had been ) george gershwin was familiar with klezmer music , and the opening clarinet glissando of rhapsody in blue suggests this influence , although the composer did not compose klezmer directly musicians began to track down older european klezmer , by listening to recordings , finding transcriptions , and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in eastern europe other artists like yale strom used their first-hand field research and recordings from as early as 1981 in central and eastern europe as a foundation for more of a fusion between traditional repertoire and original compositions , as well as incorporating the rom ( roma ) music element into the jewish style today the band has developed a new sound of modern klezmer , pushing the perimeter of klezmer to incorporate many cultures and touring worldwide '' bulgareasca/bulgarish/bulgar : the transformation of a klezmer dance genre '' by walter zev feldman in american klezmer p.84 much of the traditional klezmer repertoire was created by professional klezmer musicians in the style of their region or tradition , and much co-territorial music such as non-jewish folksongs , especially romanian music ( mainly from moldavia ) , as well as ukrainian music and ottoman music , and the musics of other minorities living in the same areas as jews in southeastern europe such as crimean tatars in the 21st century , klezmer is typically learned from '' fake books '' and transcriptions of old recordings , although the music was traditionally transmitted and learned by ear most klezmer pieces are for dancing to , from fast to slow tempo : freylekhs ( also bulgar , bulgarish & nbsp ; – literally '' bulgarian '' , volekhl/vulekhl & nbsp ; – literally '' wallachian '' , or '' romanian '' ) is an ( divided ) circle dance , usually in the ahava rabboh melodic mode it is one of the most common klezmer dances the yiddish name zhok comes from the romanian term joc ( literally '' dance '' ) kolomyjka is a fast and catchy dance in time , which originated in ukraine , and is prominent in the folk music of that country terk in america is one famous arrangement by naftule brandwein , who used this form extensively its basis is the romanian shepherd 's lament , so it has an expressive vocal quality , like the singing of the khazn although it has no form , it is not just random sounds in a jewish mode—the musician works with very particular references to jewish prayer and east european laments most klezmer tunes are in several sections , sometimes with each in a different key instrumental tunes often follow the types of chord progressions found in middle eastern and greek music , whereas vocal yiddish songs are often much simpler , and follow a style and chord progressions similar to russian folk songs freylekhs are often in the form abcb , which is rare in music modern klezmer instrumentation is more commonly influenced by the instruments of the 19th century military bands than the earlier orchestras the orchestration used by joel rubin—one of the most experienced and knowledgeable contemporary klezmer musicians—represents a historically justified link with that of contemporary ethnic music ensembles of romania and hungary in eastern europe , percussion was often provided by a drummer who played a frame drum , or poyk , sometimes called baraban their bands are similar to a typical jazz band , with some differences when a cymbalom sound is called for , a piano may be played other bands look back to different eras or regions in an effort to recreate specific styles of klezmer—for example , budowitz , the chicago klezmer band , veretski pass , di naye kapelye , and the hungarian band muzsikas with its album maramoros : the lost jewish music of transylvania in its historic form , klezmer was live music designed to facilitate dancing ( this is also a feature of many rom and russian folk songs ) like other musicians of their time , and many modern jazz performers , early klezmorim did not rigidly follow the beat much of klezmer music uses the ahavah rabboh scale ( such as nigun rikud , tish nigun and numerous freylekhs ) , although mi sheberach is prevalent as well
