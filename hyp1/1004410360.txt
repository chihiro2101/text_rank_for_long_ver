diffserv relies on a mechanism to classify and mark packets as belonging to a specific class different phbs may be defined to offer , for example , low-loss or low-latency service rather than differentiating network traffic based on the requirements of an individual flow , diffserv operates on the principle of traffic classification , placing each data packet into one of a limited number of traffic classes since no classification and policing is required in the core router , functionality there can then be kept simple phb treatment is achieved by core routers using a combination of scheduling policy and queue management policy while diffserv does recommend a standardized set of traffic classes , the diffserv architecture does not incorporate predetermined judgments of what types of traffic should be given priority treatment the standard traffic classes ( discussed below ) serve to simplify interoperability between different networks and different vendors ' equipment a traffic classifier may inspect many different parameters in incoming packets , such as source address , destination address or traffic type and assign individual packets to a specific traffic class for tight control over volumes and type of traffic in a given class , a network operator may choose not to honor markings at the ingress to the diffserv domain filtering dscp in theory , a network could have up to 64 different traffic classes using the 64 available dscp values in practice , however , most networks use the following commonly defined per-hop behaviors : default forwarding ( df ) phb — which is typically best-effort traffic expedited forwarding ( ef ) phb — dedicated to low-loss , low-latency traffic assured forwarding ( af ) phb — gives assurance of delivery under prescribed conditions class selector phbs — which maintain backward compatibility with the ip precedence field essentially , any traffic that does not meet the requirements of any of the other defined classes uses df the details of how individual routers deal with the ds field are configuration specific , therefore it is difficult to predict end-to-end behavior ) — configuration guidelines for diffserv service classes — a differentiated services code point ( dscp ) for capacity-admitted traffic — differentiated services quality of service policy information base
