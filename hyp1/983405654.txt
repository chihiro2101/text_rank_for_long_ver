from 1975 the minox name also became associated with other products , most notably the minox 35 & nbsp ; mm compact cameras produced from 1975 until 2004 during this time , the minox company continued to develop the camera , working with gossen to develop a companion miniature exposure meter , as well as improved models such as the minox b , which incorporated an even smaller gossen-designed meter into the camera itself one accessory even allowed the camera to use a pair of binoculars as a telephoto lens ( see illustration ) there is also the fully electronic entry-level model , the ec , which has a very different internal design and has a fixed-focus lens the production rate for these cameras is considerably slower than in former years , however , as minox devotes more time to the design and marketing of oem cameras under the minox brand the minox tlx camera was available until september 2014 the close-focusing lens and small size of the camera made it perfect for covert uses such as surveillance or document copying right the original riga-made minox had a brass chassis covered in a stainless steel shell , which telescopes to reveal or cover the lens and viewfinder windows , as well as to advance the film these were advanced features at the time for any camera , regardless of size the minox cameras project an image of 8×11 & nbsp ; mm onto the negative performance could be improved , so the short-lived minox ii ( 1948–1951 ) had a new 5 element lens ( called complan ) whose final element would rest against the film itself when the pressure plate pushed the film onto the lens customers complained of film scratches with this new design , so most of these lenses were replaced by minox with the later curved-field compensating lens the complan lens has a curved film plane , hence in these cameras the negative must be held in an arc to improve the edge-to-edge sharpness of the image later models , beginning with late model minox b , to the current model tlx , using the 15 & nbsp ; mm f/3.5 four-element , three-group flat-field minox lens , holds the negative flat the advance was attributed by rolf kasemeier ( small minox big pictures 1971 edition ) to new rare-earth element , high-index , low-dispersion , optical glasses becoming available ( probably from schott glass , of jena ) note that lens performance between old and new complan/minox lenses was rated by minox themselves as identical at this time to differentiate between negatives taken with the older complan lens and negatives taken with the later minox lens , minox introduced an edge code in the negative since the minox c ( the first camera released with the new minox lens ) every 8x11mm camera had a distinct edge code to identify the camera complan lens and minox lens are unit focusing lens , focusing from 8 inches ( 20 & nbsp ; cm ) to infinity through precision gear linked to a focusing dial on top of the camera for mechanical minox 8x11 cameras , a separate shutter speed dial sets the shutter speed from 1/2 to 1/1000 second , plus b and t ( bl has no documented t ) for electromagnetic shutter cameras , the shutter dial starts with 1/15 sec , and ends with 1/1000 ( minox c ) , or starts with 1/30 and ends with 1/2000 ( minox lx/tlx/clx ) ; the electromagnetic minox camera also has an ' a ' setting for automatic exposure , controlled by the built-in cds ( minox c ) or spd ( minox lx/tlx ) exposure meter for riga minox to minox b , the film advances each time the camera is closed , regardless of whether a picture is taken or not from minox bl onward , the camera is equipped with a '' freewheeling '' mechanism , such that the film advances one frame only when a picture is taken , otherwise , closing the camera does not advance a frame thumb wheel film advance and shutter cocking , mechanical shutter speed 1/125 sec , lens 1:4.8 15mm three element in 2 group glass lens , focusing dial : 1m,2m,4m and infinity matching the size of the slide film for the 8×11 minox cameras , minox also produced slide projectors ending with the auto-focus hp24 model thumb in 1974 minox introduced a very compact ( 100 & nbsp ; mm × 61 & nbsp ; mm × 31 & nbsp ; mm ) , glass fibre reinforced makrolon bodied 35 mm film camera designed by professor fischer of vienna university : the minox el , the first one in minox 35 & nbsp ; mm series these compact cameras featured a drawbridge style lens cover which when lowered brought forward a 35 & nbsp ; mm focal length f/2.8 four-element , three-group tessar-type minotar/minoxar lens with between the lens leaf shutter and diaphragm , a center positioned viewfinder , two stroke film winder lever and a film rewind knob until 1995 the minox 35 cameras were considered the smallest cameras for the standard 35 & nbsp ; mm film format the design was inspired by the rollei 35 , which had been the smallest 35 & nbsp ; mm camera for eight years due to the extra metal shell , the dimension of minox m.d.c is slightly larger than other minox 35 cameras minox 110s , a 110 film format camera was also once sold later , a range of digital cameras was offered
