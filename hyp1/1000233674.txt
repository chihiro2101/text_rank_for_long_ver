plasma displays are bright ( 1,000 & nbsp ; lux or higher for the display module ) , have a wide color gamut , and can be produced in fairly large sizes—up to diagonally ) hdguru.com – choosing the hdtv that ’ s right for you led-backlit lcd televisions have been developed to reduce this distinction the display panel itself is about thick , generally allowing the device 's total thickness ( including electronics ) to be less than power consumption varies greatly with picture content , with bright scenes drawing significantly more power than darker ones – this is also true for crts as well as modern lcds where led backlight brightness is adjusted dynamically most screens are set to '' vivid '' mode by default in the factory ( which maximizes the brightness and raises the contrast so the image on the screen looks good under the extremely bright lights that are common in big box stores ) , which draws at least twice the power ( around 500–700 watts ) of a '' home '' setting of less extreme brightness plasmatvbuyingguide.com – how long do plasma tvs last ? meow plasma screens are made out of glass , which may result in glare on the screen from nearby light sources although a few companies have been able to make plasma enhanced-definition televisions ( edtv ) this small , even fewer have made 32 inch plasma hdtvs less visible motion blur , thanks in large part to very high refresh rates and a faster response time , contributing to superior performance when displaying content with significant amounts of rapid motion such as auto racing , hockey , baseball , etc uses more electrical power , on average , than an lcd tv using a led backlight older ccfl backlights for lcd panels used quite a bit more power , and older plasma tvs used quite a bit more power than recent models plasma displays are generally heavier than lcd and may require more careful handling , such as being kept upright fixed-pixel displays such as plasma tvs scale the video image of each incoming signal to the native resolution of the display panel thus the input energy is converted to mostly infrared but also as visible light plasma panels use pulse-width modulation ( pwm ) to control brightness : by varying the pulses of current flowing through the different cells thousands of times per second , the control system can increase or decrease the intensity of each subpixel color to create billions of different combinations of red , green and blue in this way , the control system can produce most of the visible colors lcds may use one or two large fluorescent lamps as a backlight source , but the different colors are controlled by lcd units , which in effect behave as gates that allow or block light through red , green , or blue filters on the front of the lcd panel lcd : which is right for you ? afterdawn.com – plasma display gizmodo – giz explains : plasma tv basics to produce light , the cells need to be driven at a relatively high voltage ( ~300 volts ) and the pressure of the gases inside the cell needs to be low ( ~500 torr ) in contrast , a full-on-full-off test measures the ratio using a pure black screen and a pure white screen , which gives higher values but does not represent a typical viewing scenario some displays , using many different technologies , have some '' leakage '' of light , through either optical or electronic means , from lit pixels to adjacent pixels so that dark pixels that are near bright ones appear less dark than they do during a full-off display this precharging means the cells can not achieve a true black , whereas an led backlit lcd panel can actually turn off parts of the backlight , in '' spots '' or '' patches '' ( this technique , however , does not prevent the large accumulated passive light of adjacent lamps , and the reflection media , from returning values from within the panel ) some manufacturers have reduced the precharge and the associated background glow , to the point where black levels on modern plasmas are starting to become close to some high-end crts sony and mitsubishi produced ten years before the comparable plasma displays it is important to note that plasma displays were developed for ten more years than crts ; it is almost certain that if crts had been developed for as long as plasma displays were , the contrast on crts would have been far better than contrast on the plasma displays with an lcd , black pixels are generated by a light polarization method ; many panels are unable to completely block the underlying backlight more recent lcd panels using led illumination can automatically reduce the backlighting on darker scenes , though this method can not be used in high-contrast scenes , leaving some light showing from black parts of an image with bright parts , such as ( at the extreme ) a solid black screen with one fine intense bright line edgelit models can not compete with this as the light is reflected via a light guide to distribute the light behind the panel plasma displays also exhibit another image retention issue which is sometimes confused with screen burn-in damage in this mode , when a group of pixels are run at high brightness ( when displaying white , for example ) for an extended period , a charge build-up in the pixel structure occurs and a ghost image can be seen nonetheless , the plasma displays ' relatively large screen size and 1 & nbsp ; inch thickness made them suitable for high-profile placement in lobbies and stock exchanges the panaplex display , generically referred to as a gas-discharge or gas-plasma display , uses the same technology as later plasma video displays , but began life as a seven-segment display for use in adding machines they became popular for their bright orange luminous look and found nearly ubiquitous use throughout the late 1970s and into the 1990s in cash registers , calculators , pinball machines , aircraft avionics such as radios , navigation , and stormscopes ; test equipment such as frequency counters and multimeters ; and generally anything that previously used nixie tube or numitron displays with a high digit-count these displays were eventually replaced by leds because of their low current-draw and module-flexibility , but are still found in some applications where their high brightness is desired , such as pinball machines and avionics plasma displays had a better contrast ratio , viewability angle , and less motion blur than the lcds that were available at the time , and were used until the introduction of active-matrix color lcd displays in 1992 in the year 2000 , the first 60-inch plasma display was developed by plasmaco panasonic was also reported to have developed a process to make plasma displays using ordinary window glass instead of the much more expensive '' high strain point '' glass until the early 2000s , plasma displays were the most popular choice for hdtv flat panel display as they had many benefits over lcds beyond plasma 's deeper blacks , increased contrast , faster response time , greater color spectrum , and wider viewing angle ; they were also much bigger than lcds , and it was believed that lcds were suited only to smaller sized televisions the increased size , lower weight , falling prices , and often lower electrical power consumption of lcds made them competitive with plasma television sets screen sizes have increased since the introduction of plasma displays
