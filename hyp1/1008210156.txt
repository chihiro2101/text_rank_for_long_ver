after the war , he earned a living as a carpenter and became active in politics , joining the social democratic party the communist newspapers branded koivisto as their number one enemy due to his status as a major figure in the struggle for control of the trade unions he served as prime minister for two years until the 1970 parliamentary election , which saw the other parties in the coalition government – centre , skdl , spp , and tpsl – suffer heavy losses , bringing about koivisto 's resignation as prime minister and chairman of the bank of finland who enjoyed high ratings in opinion polls , koivisto began to be seen as a likely future candidate for the presidency in early 1981 , president kekkonen began to regret koivisto 's appointment as prime minister and started to offer support to those who wanted to get rid of him in the spring of 1981 , members of centre , which was serving as part of the government coalition , launched a behind-the-scenes attempt to bring down the government through a parliamentary motion of no confidence , so that koivisto would not be able to conduct a presidential election campaign from the position of prime minister some question whether this government crisis was just a part of the ruthless '' presidential game '' that top politicians such as koivisto and social democratic chairman sorsa were playing with one another by october 1981 , it became apparent that kekkonen was too ill to carry out his duties , and he announced he would not run again koivisto became the acting president and was able to launch his presidential election campaign from the position during the campaign , koivisto was questioned particularly thoroughly on two issues : the nature of his socialism and his relations to the soviet union '' to a journalist 's question , intended to be a difficult one , on the issue of relations with the soviet union , koivisto replied that they were nothing to boast about ; this answer increased his popularity koivisto did not want to be elected with the support of the soviet union as a result , koivisto became finland 's first socialist president his victory completed a long process of integrating the social democrats into finland 's political life , dating back to the civil war those statements were not often easy to interpret , unlike kekkonen 's blunt and sometimes harsh statements ( see , for example , '' the republic 's president 1956-1982 '' /tasavallan presidentti 1956–1982 , published in finland in 1993–94 ; '' the republic 's president 1982-1994 '' /tasavallan presidentti 1982–1994 , published in finland in 1993–94 ; mauno koivisto , '' two terms i : memories and notes , 1982-1994 '' /kaksi kautta i as the leader of finland 's foreign policies he initially continued kekkonen 's line until the collapse of the soviet union he also continued the established practice of returning soviet defectors to the soviet union , a custom now prohibited as a human rights violation by the finnish constitution in the critical moments during which the soviet union was collapsing , and the baltic countries , particularly estonia , were declaring themselves independent , koivisto referred to the policy of neutrality and avoided publicly supporting the baltic independence movement , but its members were allowed to work from finland koivisto 's finland recognized the new estonian government only after the major powers had done so koivisto made two bold unilateral diplomatic moves that significantly changed the finnish political position the treaty , the military article of which had shaped finnish foreign policy for decades , was substituted with a new treaty without military obligations in the next year
