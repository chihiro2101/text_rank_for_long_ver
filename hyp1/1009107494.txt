this allowed him to demonstrate that the brain attained a steady-state regime in which the amplitude and phase of the harmonics ( frequency components ) of the response were approximately constant over time by analogy with the steady-state response of a resonant circuit that follows the initial transient response he defined an idealized steady-state evoked potential ( ssep ) as a form of response to repetitive sensory stimulation in which the constituent frequency components of the response remain constant with time in both amplitude and phase different sites of stimulation or different stimuli can be tagged with slightly different frequencies that are virtually identical to the brain , but easily separated by fourier series analyzers by frequency-tagging two superimposed gratings , spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties of the brain mechanisms that process spatial form can be isolated and studied the existence of a ( 2fv + 2fa ) component in the evoked magnetic brain response demonstrated an audio-visual convergence area in the human brain , and the distribution of this response over the head allowed this brain area to be localized more recently , frequency tagging has been extended from studies of sensory processing to studies of selective attention and of consciousness subsequent authors have implemented the sweep technique by using computer software to increment the spatial frequency of a grating in a series of small steps and to compute a time-domain average for each discrete spatial frequency the sweep technique has proved useful in measuring rapidly adapting visual processes and also for recording from babies , where recording duration is necessarily short they have emphasized that , in diagnosing abnormal visual development , the more precise the developmental norms , the more sharply can the abnormal be distinguished from the normal , and to that end have documented normal visual development in a large group of infants sensory evoked potentials ( sep ) are recorded from the central nervous system following stimulation of sense organs , for example , visual evoked potentials elicited by a flashing light or changing pattern on a monitor , o'shea , r vep can be sensitive to visual dysfunctions that may not be found with just physical examinations or mri , even if it can not indicate etiologies cited it can be used to examine infant 's visual impairment for abnormal visual pathways which may be due to delayed maturation clinical recovery and visual improvement come with p100 restoration but with an abnormal increased latency that continues indefinitely , and hence , it maybe useful as an indicator of previous or subclinical optic neuritis the diffuse-light flash stimulus is rarely used nowadays due to the high variability within and across subjects normal values are depending on used stimulation hardware ( flash stimulus vs aeps ( and erps ) are very small electrical voltage potentials originating from the brain recorded from the scalp in response to an auditory stimulus , such as different tones , speech sounds , etc although stimuli such as touch , vibration , and pain can be used for ssep , electrical stimuli are most common because of ease and reliability because of the low amplitude of the signal once it reaches the patient 's scalp and the relatively high amount of electrical noise caused by background eeg , scalp muscle emg or electrical devices in the room , the signal must be averaged when used in intraoperative monitoring , the latency and amplitude of the peak relative to the patient 's post-intubation baseline is a crucial piece of information conventional sseps monitor the functioning of the part of the somatosensory system involved in sensations such as touch and vibration the part of the somatosensory system that transmits pain and temperature signals is monitored using laser evoked potentials ( lep ) in the peripheral nervous system pain and heat signals are carried along thin ( c and a delta ) fibers to the spinal cord , and leps can be used to determine whether a neuropathy is located in these small fibers as opposed to larger ( touch , vibration ) fibers transcranial electrical mep ( tcemep ) has been in widespread use for several years for intraoperative monitoring of pyramidal tract functional integrity it has become clear that these '' motor '' potentials were almost entirely elicited by antidromic stimulation of sensory tractsâ€”even when the recording was from muscles ( antidromic sensory tract stimulation triggers myogenic responses through synapses at the root entry level ) tcmep , whether electrical or magnetic , is the most practical way to ensure pure motor responses , since stimulation of sensory cortex can not result in descending impulses beyond the first synapse ( synapses can not be backfired ) because mep amplitude is correlated with motor excitability , they offer a quantitative way to test the role of various types of intervention on the motor system ( pharmacological , behavioral , lesion , etc in addition , meps are used as a reference to adjust the intensity of stimulation that needs to be delivered by tms when targeting cortical regions whose response might not be as easily measurable , e.g sensory evoked potentials may also be used during surgeries which place brain structures at risk this technique effectively evaluates the motor pathways in the central nervous system during surgeries which place these structures at risk the two modalities are thus complementary , electrical stimulation being the choice for intraoperative monitoring , and magnetic for clinical applications .
