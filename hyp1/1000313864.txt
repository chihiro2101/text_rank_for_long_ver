the state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra at high bladder volumes , afferent firing increases , causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge the ability to voluntarily inhibit micturition develops by the age of 2–3 years , as control at higher levels of the central nervous system develops therefore , the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full diuresis ( production of urine by the kidney ) occurs constantly , and as the bladder becomes full , afferent firing increases , yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination , and continues until the bladder is empty urine remaining in the male urethra is expelled by several contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscle , and , by some men , manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine for land mammals over 1 kilogram , the duration of urination does not vary with body mass , being dispersed around an average of 21 seconds ( standard deviation 13 seconds ) , despite a 4 order of magnitude ( 1000× ) difference in bladder volume new law of urination : mammals take 20 seconds to pee , carrie arnold , national geographic , 23 october 2013 this is due to increased urethra length of large animals , which amplifies gravitational force ( hence flow rate ) , and increased urethra width , which increases flow rate for smaller mammals a different phenomenon occurs , where urine is discharged as droplets , and urination in smaller mammals , such as mice and rats , can occur in less than a second in humans with lesions in the superior frontal gyrus , the desire to urinate is reduced and there is also difficulty in stopping micturition once it has commenced however , stimulation experiments in animals indicate that other cortical areas also affect the process voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles aids the expulsion of urine by increasing the pressure applied to the urinary bladder wall , but voiding can be initiated without straining even when the bladder is nearly empty in many males the feeling of the need to urinate can be sensed at the base of the penis as well as the bladder , even though the neural activity associated with a full bladder comes from the bladder itself , and can be felt there as well in females the need to urinate is felt in the lower abdomen region when the bladder is full in all three types the bladder contracts , but the contractions are generally not sufficient to empty the viscus completely , and residual urine is left in the bladder paruresis , also known as shy bladder syndrome , is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area as these people may have difficulty urinating in the presence of others and will consequently avoid using urinals directly adjacent to another person gradually , however , the muscle of the '' decentralized bladder '' becomes active , with many contraction waves that expel dribbles of urine out of the urethra the reason for the difference between the small , hypertrophic bladder seen in this condition and the distended , hypotonic bladder seen when only the afferent nerves are interrupted is not known due to the positions where the urethra exits the body , males and females often use different techniques for urination elderly males with prostate gland enlargement may benefit from sitting down while in healthy males , no difference is found in the ability to urinate an alternative method for women to urinate standing is to use a tool known as a female urination device to assist a common technique used in many undeveloped nations involves holding the child by the backs of the thighs , above the ground , facing outward , in order to urinate occasionally , if a male 's penis is damaged or removed , or a female 's genitals/urinary tract is damaged , other urination techniques must be used most often in such cases , doctors will reposition the urethra to a location where urination can still be accomplished , usually in a position that would promote urination only while seated/squatting , though a permanent urinary catheter may be used in rare cases babies have little socialized control over urination within traditions or families that do not practice elimination communication and instead use diapers public toilets may have urinals , usually for males , although female urinals exist , designed to be used in various ways urination in a heavily wooded area is generally harmless , actually saves water , and may be condoned for males ( and less commonly , females ) in certain situations as long as common sense is used one proposed way to inhibit public urination due to drunkenness is the urilift , which is disguised as a normal manhole by day but raises out of the ground at night to provide a public restroom for bar-goers in islamic toilet etiquette , it is haram to urinate while facing the qibla , or to turn one 's back to it when urinating or relieving bowels but modesty requirements for females make it impossible for girls to relieve themselves without facilities women generally need to urinate more frequently than men due to having smaller bladders resisting the urge to urinate because of lack of facilities can promote urinary tract infections which can lead to more serious infections and , in rare situations , can cause renal damage in women however , in public restrooms without urinals and sometimes at home , men may be urged to use the sitting position as to diminish spattering of urine a systematic review meta-analysis of the effect of voiding position on the quality of urination found that in elderly males with benign prostate hyperplasia , the sitting position was superior compared with the standing a partial squatting position ( or '' hovering '' ) is taken up during urination by some women to avoid sitting on a potentially contaminated toilet seat or when using a female urinal however , this may leave urine behind in the bladder since elimination of bodily wastes is , of necessity , a subject talked about with toddlers during toilet training , other expressions considered suitable for use by and with children exist , and some continue to be used by adults , e.g other expressions include '' squirting '' and '' taking a leak '' , and , predominantly by younger persons for outdoor female urination , '' popping a squat '' , referring to the position many women adopt in such circumstances drinking urine is known as urophagia , though uraphagia refers to the consumption of urine regardless of whether the context is sexual female kob may exhibit urolagnia during sex ; one female will urinate while the other sticks her nose in the stream while the primary purpose of urination is the same across the animal kingdom , urination often serves a social purpose beyond the expulsion of waste material some animals ' ( example : carnivores ' ) urine possesses a strong odour , especially when it is used to mark territory or stallions sometimes exhibit the flehmen response by smelling the urine of a mare in heat behaviorally , there is a difference between regular urination , where the tail is slightly raised and a stream of urine is produced , and marking behavior , where the tail is held up in display and only a few drops are used the urine marking behavior is also most frequent during the mating season , and may play a role in reproductive communication between groups domestic dogs mark their territories by urinating on vertical surfaces ( usually at nose level ) , sometimes marking over the urine of other dogs male dogs , as well as wolves , sometimes lift a leg and attempt to urinate even when their bladders are empty & nbsp ; – this is known as a '' raised-leg display '' , '' shadow-urination '' , or '' pseudo-urination '' they typically mark their territory due to the presence of new stimuli or social triggers in a dog 's environment , as well as out of anxiety however , females sometimes also raise their legs , and males sometimes squat urine marking is also associated with pair bonding in coyotes coyotes sometimes urinate on their food , possibly to claim ownership over it however , female bush dogs use a kind of handstand posture , which is less common in other canids males show a grimacing face , called the flehmen response , when identifying a female 's reproductive condition by sniffing their urine markings
