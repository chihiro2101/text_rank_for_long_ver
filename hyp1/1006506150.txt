one example is the lituus , the traditional staff of the ancient roman augurs , as well as the staff of moses in the hebrew bible in the western church the usual form has been a shepherd 's crook , curved at the top to enable animals to be hooked it is also reminiscent of the rod of the ancient greek god asclepius , whose worship was centered around the aegean , including asia minor , indicating the role of the bishop as healer of spiritual diseases it is used several times on god 's command to initiate the plagues of egypt a bishop or church head bears this staff as '' shepherd of the flock of god '' , particularly the community under his canonical jurisdiction , but any bishop , whether or not assigned to a functional diocese , may also use a crosier when conferring sacraments and presiding at liturgy the catholic caeremoniale episcoporum caeremoniale episcoporum ( vatican polyglott press , 1985 ) , 59 says that , as a sign of his pastoral function , a bishop uses a crosier within his territory , but any bishop celebrating the liturgy solemnly with the consent of the local bishop may also use it it adds that , when several bishops join in a single celebration , only the one presiding uses a crosier a bishop usually holds his crosier with his left hand , leaving his right hand free to bestow blessings it also states that a bishop usually holds the crosier during a procession and when listening to the reading of the gospel , giving a homily , accepting vows , solemn promises or a profession of faith , and when blessing people , unless he must lay his hands on them when the bishop is not holding the crosier , it is put in the care of an altar server , known as the '' crosier bearer '' , who may wear around his shoulders a shawl-like veil called a vimpa , so as to hold the crosier without touching it with his bare hands in the anglican tradition , the crosier may be carried by someone else walking before the bishop in a procession although there is no provision for the presentation of a crosier in the liturgy associated with the blessing of an abbess , by long-standing custom an abbess may bear one when leading her community of nuns in the middle ages , much as bishops carried a crosier , popes carried a papal cross with three bars , one more than the two bars found on crosiers carried before archbishops in processions ( see archiepiscopal cross ) in the coptic orthodox church of alexandria , crosiers are sometimes somewhat longer and are always decorated with a blood red cloth around the top cross and the serpents they may also be made of wood , though this is more common of the crosier carried by an abbot than of a bishop in some very ornate crosiers , the place where the staff meets the crook may be designed to represent a church in the roman catholic church , the crosier is always carried by the bishop with the crook turned away from himself ; that is to say , facing toward the persons or objects he is facing , regardless of whether he is the ordinary or not the traditional explanation for the form of western crosiers , beyond the obvious reference to the bishop as a shepherd to his flock , is this : the pointed ferrule at the base symbolizes the obligation of the prelate to goad the spiritually lazy ; the crook at the top , his obligation to draw back those who stray from the faith ; and the staff itself , his obligation to stand as a firm support for the faithful
