atmospheric or wind-borne fugitive dust , also known as aeolian dust , comes from arid and dry regions where high velocity winds are able to remove mostly silt-sized material , deflating susceptible surfaces this airborne dust is considered an aerosol and once in the atmosphere , it can produce strong local radiative forcing saharan dust in particular can be transported and deposited as far as the caribbean and the amazon basin , and may affect air temperatures , cause ocean cooling , and alter rainfall amounts road dust is a significant source contributing to the generation and release of particulate into the atmosphere the danger of coal dust resulted in environmental legislation regulating work place air quality in some jurisdictions in addition , if enough coal dust is dispersed within the air in a given area , in very rare circumstances , it can create an explosion hazard under certain circumstances control measures include such simple practices as spraying construction and demolition sites with water , and preventing the tracking of dust onto adjacent roads dust in such places may be suppressed by mechanical methods , including paving or laying down gravel , or stabilizing the surface with water , vegetable oils or other dust abatement , or by using water misters to suppress dust that is already airborne care is required when removing dust to avoid causing the dust to become airborne central vacuum cleaners can be effective in removing dust , especially if they are exhausted directly to the outdoors a dust resistant surface is a state of prevention against dust contamination or damage , by a design or treatment of materials and items in manufacturing or through a repair process a reduced tacticity of a synthetic layer or covering can protect surfaces and release small molecules that could have remained attached dust also covers solid planetary bodies , and vast dust storms can occur on mars which cover almost the entire planet dust samples returned from outer space may provide information about conditions in the early solar system they and their feces and other allergens which they produce are major constituents of house dust , but because they are so heavy they are not suspended for long in the air
