judicial punishment can never be used merely as a means to promote some other good for the criminal himself or for civil society , but instead it must in all cases be imposed on him only on the ground that he has committed a crime kant regarded punishment as a matter of justice , which must be carried out by the state for the sake of the law , not for the sake of the criminal or the victim while retributive justice is usually considered as a cornerstone of criminal punishment , it has been shown that it also plays a role in private law according to the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy , retributive justice is committed to three principles : '' those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts , paradigmatically serious crimes , morally deserve to suffer a proportionate punishment '' however , this does not mean that the punishment has to be equivalent to the crime a retributive justice system 's assessment of blameworthiness ( or lack thereof ) can either justify punishment or serve merely to limit the punishments society imposes for other reasons when the punishment involves a fine , the theory does not allow the financial position of an offender to be considered , leading to situations in which a poor individual and a millionaire could be forced to pay the same amount the retributive theory 's lack of consideration of the perpetrator 's and victim 's status has led many jurisdictions to move away from it in various ways , including punitive equality and taking into consideration the status and wealth , or lack of status and wealth , of an offender and their consequent ability to both pay fines and defend themselves effectively in court '' more generally , prioritizing justice for the public over crime control goals has come under criticism as attributable more to the relative ease of writing sentencing guidelines as crime tariffs ( as opposed to describing the appropriate influence of situational and personal characteristics on punishment ) than to any sound arguments about penological theory in pre-modern societies such sentences were often the equivalent of the death penalty as individuals would find it impossible to survive without the support and protection of the society that they had wronged capital punishment eye for an eye penal harm proportionality ( law ) restorative justice '' two wrongs make a right ''
