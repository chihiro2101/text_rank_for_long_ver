this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties 3,294,489 ) for producing a high carbon content ( 99 % ) fiber using rayon as a precursor the high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 in a process developed by w during the 1960s , experimental work to find alternative raw materials led to the introduction of carbon fibers made from a petroleum pitch derived from oil processing since the late 1970s , further types of carbon fiber yarn entered the global market , offering higher tensile strength and higher elastic modulus jacob lahijani invented balanced ultra-high young 's modulus ( greater than 100 mpsi ) and high tensile strength pitch carbon fiber ( greater than 500 kpsi ) used extensively in automotive and aerospace applications depending upon the precursor to make the fiber , carbon fiber may be turbostratic or graphitic , or have a hybrid structure with both graphitic and turbostratic parts present carbon fiber can have higher cost than other materials which has been one of the limiting factors of adoption in a comparison between steel and carbon fiber materials for automotive industry , carbon fiber may be 10-12x more expensive carbon fiber is most notably used to reinforce composite materials , particularly the class of materials known as carbon fiber reinforced polymer non-polymer materials can also be used as the matrix for carbon fibers due to the formation of metal carbides and corrosion considerations , carbon has seen limited success in metal matrix composite applications the fiber also finds use in filtration of high-temperature gases , as an electrode with high surface area and impeccable corrosion resistance , and as an anti-static component passing current through the composite material 3d network of carbon fibers dissipates thermal energy that increases the surface temperature of the asphalt , which is able to melt ice and snow above it for example , 200 & nbsp ; tex for 3,000 & nbsp ; filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as 1,000 & nbsp ; carbon filament yarn , but is also three times as heavy due to its chemical inertness , it can be used relatively safely amongst most fabrics and materials ; however , shorts caused by the material folding back on itself will lead to increased heat production and can lead to a fire for synthetic polymers such as pan or rayon , the precursor is first spun into filament yarns , using chemical and mechanical processes to initially align the polymer molecules in a way to enhance the final physical properties of the completed carbon fiber a common method of manufacture involves heating the spun pan filaments to approximately 300 & nbsp ; °c in air , which breaks many of the hydrogen bonds and oxidizes the material making carbon fiber how carbon fiber is made [ carbon fibres – the first 5 naked years
