the u.s he worked as a draftsman for the public lighting commission for a year and a half to improve his family 's financial status , then returned to lawrence to finish his degree while back in college , he worked part-time at chrysler and at a local body shop , foreshadowing his later contributions to the automotive industry instead of immediately entering the engineering workforce after earning his degree , delorean sold life insurance he developed an analytical system aimed at engineers and sold '' about 850,000 worth of policies in ten months '' however , he found the work boring and moved on to work for the factory equipment corporation delorean 's time at chrysler lasted less than a year , ending in 1953 when he was offered a salary of us 14,000 at packard under the supervision of the engineer forest mcfarland however , it proved to have a positive effect on delorean 's attention to engineering detail , and after four years at packard he became mcfarland 's successor as head of research and development while still a profitable company , packard suffered alongside other independents as it struggled to compete when ford and general motors engaged in a price war delorean considered keeping his job and moving to studebaker headquarters in south bend , indiana , when he received a call from oliver k kelley called to offer delorean his choice of a job in any of five divisions of gm delorean 's years of engineering at pontiac were successful , producing dozens of patented innovations for the company , and in 1961 he was promoted to the position of division chief engineer this marked the beginning of pontiac 's renaissance as gm 's performance division instead of its previous position with no clear brand identity the car and its popularity continued to grow in the following years delorean received almost total credit for its success – conceptualizing , engineering , and marketing – becoming the golden boy of pontiac , and was rewarded with his 1965 promotion to head the entire pontiac division at the age of 40 , delorean had broken the record for youngest division head at gm and was determined to continue his string of successes in response to the '' pony car '' market dominated by the wildly successful ford mustang , delorean asked gm executives for permission to market a smaller version of the pontiac banshee show car for 1966 delorean 's version was rejected because of gm 's concern that his design would take away sales from the corvette , their flagship performance vehicle shortly after the firebird 's introduction , delorean turned his attention to the development of an all-new grand prix , the division 's personal luxury car based on the full-sized pontiac line since 1962 delorean knew pontiac division could n't finance the new car alone , so he went to his former boss pete estes and asked to share the cost of development with pontiac , having a one-year exclusivity before chevrolet would release the 1970 monte carlo during his time at pontiac , delorean had begun to enjoy the freedom and celebrity that came with his position and spent a good deal of his time traveling to locations around the world to support promotional events even as general motors experienced revenue declines , pontiac remained highly profitable under delorean , and despite his growing reputation as a corporate maverick , on february 15 , 1969 , he was again promoted the new model camaro was due out for the 1970 model year , and it was rapidly falling behind schedule redesigns for the corvette and nova were also delayed , and unit sales had still not recovered from the past four years of turmoil , much of that because of the bad publicity surrounding the corvair and well-publicized quality-control issues affecting other chevy models , including defective motor mounts that led to an unprecedented recall of 6.7 million chevrolets built between 1965 and 1969 in a motor trend interview in august 1970 , delorean said , '' vega will be the highest quality product ever built by chevrolet he stated , '' the first cars , from a manufacturing standpoint , were well built rodden at random in 1972 , delorean was appointed to the position of vice president of car and truck production for the entire general motors line , and his eventual rise to president seemed inevitable however , the idea of him assuming that position was almost intolerable to gm executives , and on april 2 , 1973 , he announced that he was leaving the company , telling the press , '' i want to do things in the social area gm gave him a florida cadillac franchise as a retirement gift , and delorean took over the presidency of the national alliance of businessmen , a charitable trust with the mission of employing americans in need , founded by lyndon johnson and henry ford ii delorean was sharply critical of the direction gm had taken by the start of the 1970s , as well as objecting to the idea of using rebates to sell cars : '' there 's no forward response at general motors to what the public wants today.a car should make people 's eyes light up when they step into the showroom after going into receivership in february 1982 , dmc produced another 2,000 cars until john delorean 's arrest in late october , at which point liquidation proceedings were undertaken and the factory was seized by the british government for good after delorean left general motors , patrick wright , author and former business week reporter , approached him with the idea of writing a book based on his experiences there the final product , published in 1979 , on a clear day you can see general motors , sold approximately 1.6 million copies , but disagreements over the content led to a conflict between the collaborators , with wright eventually publishing the book on his own when asked after his acquittal if he planned to resume his career in the auto industry , delorean bitterly quipped , '' would you buy a used car from me ? '' harris , j in the years before his death , delorean planned to resurrect his car company and gave interviews describing a new vehicle called the dmc2 according to his family , he spent a lot of time in his last years working on this new venture the delorean motor company name was subsequently owned by a texas-based firm that provided parts and professional restoration to delorean owners '' the extraordinary life and career of controversial automaker john delorean -- from his meteoric rise at general motors co delorean : back from the future ( 2021 ) , a bbc documentary about john delorean and his short lived car company
