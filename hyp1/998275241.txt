thus spoke zarathustra , the ideas of which first came to nietzsche while walking on two roads surrounding rapallo , was conceived while writing the gay science according to elisabeth förster-nietzsche in the introduction of thomas common 's early translation of the book , nietzsche wrote that the ideas for zarathustra first came to him while walking on two roads surrounding rapallo nietzsche planned to write the book in three parts over several years nietzsche is clearly portraying a '' new '' or '' different '' zarathustra , one who transvaluation of values it possesses a unique experimental style , one that is , for instance , evident in newly invented '' dithyrambs '' narrated or sung by zarathustra zarathustra also contains the famous dictum '' god is dead , '' which had appeared earlier in the gay science it serves as a parallel and supplement to the various philosophical ideas present in nietzsche 's body of work he has , however , said that '' among my writings my zarathustra stands to my mind by itself emphasizing its centrality and its status as his masterpiece , nietzsche has stated that : since many of the book 's ideas are also present in his other works , zarathustra is seen to have served as a precursor to his later philosophical thought he later reformulated many of his ideas in beyond good and evil and various other writings that he composed thereafter in his autobiographical ecce homo , nietzsche states that the book 's underlying concept is discussed within '' the penultimate section of the fourth book '' of the gay science : the eternal recurrence of the same events kaufmann this inspiration finds its expression with zarathustra 's roundelay , featured twice in the book , once near the story 's close : many criticisms of christianity can be found in thus spoke zarathustra , particularly christian values of good and evil and its belief in an afterlife noteworthy for its format , the book comprises a philosophical work of fiction whose style often lightheartedly imitates that of the new testament and of the platonic dialogues , at times resembling pre-socratic works in tone and in its use of natural phenomena as rhetorical and explanatory devices it also features frequent references to the western literary and philosophy traditions , implicitly offering an interpretation of these traditions and of their problems moreover , it offers formulations of eternal recurrence , and nietzsche for the first time speaks of the übermensch : themes that would dominate his books from this point onwards the style of the book , along with its ambiguity and paradox nature , has helped its eventual enthusiastic reception by the reading public , but has frustrated academic attempts at analysis ( as nietzsche may have intended ) thus spoke zarathustra remained unpopular as a topic for scholars ( especially those in the anglo-american analytic tradition ) until the latter half of the 20th century brought widespread interest in nietzsche and his unconventional style the critic harold bloom criticized thus spoke zarathustra in the western canon ( 1994 ) , calling the book '' a gorgeous disaster '' and '' unreadable common reasoned that because the original german was written in a pseudo-luther bible , a pseudo-king-james-biblical style would be fitting in the english translation the common translation remained widely accepted until more critical translations , titled thus spoke zarathustra , were published by walter kaufmann in 1954 , and r.j which are considered to convey more accurately the german text than the common version kaufmann 's introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of common 's version ; he notes that in one instance , common has taken the german '' most evil '' and rendered it '' baddest '' , a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term '' baddest '' , but also because nietzsche dedicated a third of the genealogy of morals to the difference between '' bad '' and '' evil , says '' wayne 's close reading of the original text has exposed the deficiencies of earlier translations , preeminent among them that of the highly esteemed walter kaufmann '' , and gives several reasons he notes that the german text available to common was considerably flawed , and that the german text from which hollingdale and kaufmann worked was itself untrue to nietzsche 's own work in some ways kaufmann 's version , which has become the most widely available , features a translator 's note suggesting that nietzsche 's text would have benefited from an editor ; martin suggests that kaufmann '' took it upon himself to become his nietzsche 's editor nietzsche 's 'thus spoke zarathustra ' : before sunrise ( essay collection ) , edited by james luchte carl orff composed a three-movement setting of part of nietzsche 's text as a teenager , but this work remains unpublished 1896 : the book inspired richard strauss to compose the tone poem also sprach zarathustra , which he designated '' freely based on friedrich nietzsche '' 1904–05 : frederick delius based his major choral-orchestral work a mass of life ( 1904–5 ) on texts from thus spoke zarathustra 1944 : the short score of the third symphony by arnold bax originally began with a quotation from thus spoke zarathustra : '' my wisdom became pregnant on lonely mountains ;
