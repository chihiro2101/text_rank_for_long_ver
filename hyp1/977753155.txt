the letter or number corresponding to the filter was used as an index into a chart of appropriate aperture and shutter speed combinations for a given film speed cds light meters use a photoresistor sensor whose electrical resistance changes proportionately to light exposure many modern consumer still and video cameras include a built-in meter that measures a scene-wide light level and are able to make an approximate measure of appropriate exposure based on that photographers working with controlled lighting and cinematographers use handheld light meters to precisely measure the light falling on various parts of their subjects and use suitable lighting to produce the desired exposure levels this pitfall ( but not in the setting-sun case ) is avoided by incident-light meters which measure the amount of light falling on the subject using an integrating sphere ( usually , a translucent hemispherical plastic dome is used to approximate this ) placed on top of the light sensor another way to avoid under- or over-exposure for subjects with unusual reflectance is to use a spot meter : a reflected-light meter that measures light in a very tight cone , typically with a one degree circular angle of view an experienced photographer can take multiple readings over the shadows , midrange and highlights of the scene to determine optimal exposure , using systems like the zone system many modern cameras include sophisticated multi-segment metering systems that measure the luminance of different parts of the scene to determine the optimal exposure when using a film whose spectral sensitivity is not a good match to that of the light meter , for example orthochromatic black-and-white or infrared film , the meter may require special filters and re-calibration to match the sensitivity of the film what constitutes a “ medium tone ” depends on meter calibration and several other factors , including film processing or digital image conversion calibration of cameras with internal meters is covered by iso 2721:1982 ; nonetheless , many manufacturers specify ( though seldom state ) exposure calibration in terms of k , and many calibration instruments ( e.g the combination of exposure increase and the card orientation gives recommended exposures that are reasonably close to those given by an incident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor when metering with an off-axis light source many neutral test cards are far from perfectly diffuse reflectors , and specular reflections can cause increased reflected-light meter readings that , if followed , would result in underexposure it is therefore recommended to use light meters in lighting systems , especially in rooms where one can not expect users to pay attention to manually switching off the lights when the word light meter or photometer is used in place of radiometer or optometer , or it is often assumed the system was configured to see only visible light the meter/radiometer/photometer portion may have many features including : zero : subtracts ambient/back ground light levels , or stabilize the meter to the working environment hold : freezes the value on the display range : for systems that are not linear and auto ranging this function allows the user to select the portion of the meter electronics that best handles the signal level in use along with having a variety of features , a light meter may also be usable for a variety of applications some light meters also have the ability to provide a readout in many different units although a light meter can take the form of a very simple handheld tool with one-button operation , there are also many advanced light-measurement systems available for use in numerous different applications general purpose photographic exposure meters ( photoelectric type ) — guide to product specification
