there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 karen hanson ) , allyn & bacon , 1997 ; 209–45 at this point , children can make firm statements about their gender and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate

and stereotypes , ( 3 ) identifying with parents , and ( 4 ) forming gender preference although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood , many factors have been suggested as influencing its development 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction '' social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family , authority figures , mass media , and other influential people in a child 's life williams , michael , '' cultural identity , language identity , gender identity '' , '' the english academy of south africa '' , 2011 the social learning theory posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors , and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way , myers , david g john money was instrumental in the early research of gender identity , though he used the term gender role he disagreed with the previous school of thought that gender was determined solely by biology this response went against money 's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation however , vandermassen also argues that transgender people support the idea of gender identity as being biologically rooted , as they do not identify with their anatomical sex despite being raised and their behaviour reinforced according to their anatomical sex those still living as females still showed marked masculinisation of gender role behaviour and those old enough to reported sexual attraction to women the study concludes : '' the findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood , but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens sociological research in australia , a country with a third ' x ' sex classification , shows that 19 % of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an '' x '' or '' other '' option , while 52 % are women , 23 % men , and 6 % unsure a study by reiner & gearhart provides some insight into what can happen when genetically male children with cloacal exstrophy are sexually assigned female and raised as girls , according to an 'optimal gender policy ' developed by john money : in a sample of 14 children , follow-up between the ages of 5 to 12 showed that 8 of them identified as boys , and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests , providing support for the argument that genetic variables affect gender identity and behavior independent of socialization the volume of the central subdivision of the bed nucleus of a stria terminalis or bstc ( a constituent of the basal ganglia of the brain which is affected by prenatal androgens ) of transsexual women has been suggested to be similar to women 's and unlike men 's , psychology the science of behaviour , pg 418 , pearson education , neil r.carlson but the relationship between bstc volume and gender identity is still unclear different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external

suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities , as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine , feminine , or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity , with kane stating that '' the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options , separating boys from girls , devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls , and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity '' many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born , after determining the child 's sex through technology such as ultrasound these different views on gender from a child 's parents can shape the child 's understanding of gender as well as the child 's development of gender within a study conducted by hillary halpern it was hypothesized , and proven , that parent behaviors , rather than parent beliefs , regarding gender are better predictors for a child 's attitude on gender it was concluded that a mother 's behavior was especially influential on a child 's assumptions of the child 's own gender no correlation was found between a father 's behavior and his children 's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender in some cases , a person 's gender identity is inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics ( genitals and secondary sex characteristics ) , resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as outside cultural gender norms some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity ; others retain the genitalia they were born with ( see transsexual for some of the possible reasons ) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity the terms gender identity and core gender identity were first used with their current meaning—one 's personal experience of one 's own gender boles , 2013 '' to this day they are usually used in that sense , though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the sexual orientation and sexual identity categories gay , lesbian and bisexual in late-19th-century medical literature , women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called '' inverts '' , and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning , and a '' dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework '' during the mid-1900s , doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children , which meant that gender behaviors that were not part of the norm would be punished and changed the aim of this therapy was to push children back to their '' correct '' gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender during the 1950s and '60s , psychologists began studying gender development in young children , partially in an effort to understand the origins of homosexuality ( which was viewed as a mental disorder at the time ) his work at johns hopkins university 's gender identity clinic ( established in 1965 ) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity , suggesting that , up to a certain age , gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation today , sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their external sexual organs will match their gender identity the authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a mental disorder , speculating that certain dsm revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder the yogyakarta principles , a document on the application of international human rights law , provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person 's deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender , which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth , including the person 's sense of the body ( which may involve , if freely chosen , modification of bodily appearance or function by medical , surgical or other means ) and other experience of gender , including dress , speech and mannerism the right to recognition before the law and principle 18 states that '' notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary , a person 's sexual orientation and gender identity are not , in and of themselves , medical conditions and are not to be treated , cured or suppressed 43 the '' yogyakarta principles in action '' says '' it is important to note that while 'sexual orientation ' has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries , 'gender identity ' or 'gender identity disorder ' often remains in consideration kathleen stock has written that because gender identity is based on a person 's feelings , it is detached from both a person 's sex and their gender ( in the socially constructed sense ) stock also argues that because the concept of gender identity rarely comes up outside the context of gender dysphoria , '' it would seem false to say that everyone has one '' there are parts of the community that take '' two-spirit '' as a category over an identity itself , preferring to identify with culture or nation-specific gender terms
