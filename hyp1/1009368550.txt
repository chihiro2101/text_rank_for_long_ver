left the name homotherium ( greek : , 'same ' ) and , 'beast ' ) ) was proposed by emilio fabrini ( 1890 ) , without further explanation , for a new subgenus of machairodus , whose main distinguishing feature was the presence of a large diastema between the two inferior premolars several eurasian species have been recognized based mainly on differences in the size and shape of the upper canines and body size : h however , given the range of sizes found in extant large cats , it is likely that they represent a single species , homotherium latidens however , both morphological and genetic data suggest that all late pleistocene homotherium individuals worldwide should probably be regarded as members of h despite homotheriums vast range and the large quantity of fossil remains from eurasia , africa and north america , complete skeletons of this cat are relatively rare however , a 2018 study by figueirido and colleagues found that homotherium possessed a bite adapted to clamp and hold while inflicting damage with its canines that was more similar to a lion 's due to the larger amounts of trabecular bone present in the skulls of the genus this is unlike the canine shear-bite of smilodon , which it has been compared to , and this difference in killing bites provides evidence for distinct ecological adaptations based on homotheriums preference for open habitat such as plains and comparisons with modern cats , it is considered likely by ethology william allen et al that homotherium would have been plainly colored like lions to better camouflage itself left the decline of homotherium could be a result of the disappearance of large herbivorous mammals like mammoths in america at the end of the pleistocene genes revealing high genetic diversity indicate the genus was far more common than previously assumed due to the preservation bias of the fossil record the study also revealed that this genus of machairodont was most likely diurnal , and would have mainly hunted in daylight due to their saber-teeth , an attack on such thick-skinned prey would have likely been significantly easier and less time-consuming compared to a similar hunt on modern elephants by lions homotherium also seemed to have retained the excellent nocturnal vision typical of most cats , and hunting at night in the arctic regions where many homotherium have been found would have been a prime hunting method the sloped back and powerful lumbar section of homotheriums vertebrae suggest a bear-like build , and thus that these animals could have been capable of pulling formidable loads ; further , broken upper canines - a common injury in fossils of other machairodonts such as machairodus and smilodon that would have resulted from struggling with their prey - is not seen in homotherium , perhaps because their social groups would completely restrain prey items before any of the cats attempted to kill the target with their saber teeth
