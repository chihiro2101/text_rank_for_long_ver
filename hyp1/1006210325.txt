and walter burkert both argue for a connection with the akkadian word for sea , t√¢mtu ( íÄÄíÄäíÅÄ ) , following an early form , ti'amtum the later form , which appears in the hellenistic babylonian writer berossus ' first volume of universal history , is clearly related to greek , an eastern variant of it is thought that the proper name ti'amat , which is the construct or vocative form , was dropped in secondary translations of the original texts because some akkadian copyists of en√ªma elish substituted the ordinary word tƒÅmtu ( '' sea '' ) for tiamat , the two names having become essentially the same due to association it is thought that female deities are older than male ones in mesopotamia and tiamat may have begun as part of the cult of nammu , a female principle of a watery creative force , with equally strong connections to the underworld , which predates the appearance of ea-enki this characteristic is especially true of the region of bahrain , whose name in arabic means '' two seas '' , and which is thought to be the site of dilmun , the original site of the sumerian creation beliefs '' the en√ªma elish states that tiamat gave birth to dragons and serpents among a more general list of monsters including scorpion men and mermaid , but does not identify her form as that of a dragon ; however , other sources containing the same myth do refer to her as such in the myth recorded on cuneiform , the deity enki ( later ea ) believed correctly that apsu was planning to murder the younger deities , upset with the noisy tumult they created , and so captured him and held him prisoner beneath his temple , the e-abzu ( '' temple of abzu '' ) tiamat possessed the tablet of destinies and in the primordial battle she gave them to kingu , the deity she had chosen as her lover and the leader of her host , and who was also one of her children kingu was captured and later was slain : his red blood mixed with the red clay of the earth would make the body of humankind , created to act as the servant of the younger igigi deities '' this surmise that the babylonian version of the story is based upon a modified version of an older epic , in which enlil , not marduk , was the god who slew tiamat , expressed , for example , in e it is generally accepted amongst modern assyriologists that the en√ªma elish‚Äîthe babylonian creation epic to which this mythological strand is attributed‚Äîwas written as babylonian political and religious propaganda rather than reflecting a sumerian tradition ; the dating of the epic is not completely clear , but judging from the mythological topics covered and the cuneiform versions discovered thus far , it is likely to date to the 15th century bce chaoskampf motifs in other mythologies linked directly or indirectly to the tiamat myth include the hittite illuyanka myth , and in greek tradition apollo 's killing of the python as a necessary action to take over the delphic oracle martkheel according to some analyses there are two parts to the tiamat myth , the first in which tiamat is creator goddess , through a '' sacred marriage '' between different waters , peacefully creating the cosmos through successive generations the theory suggests tiamat and other ancient monster figures were depictions of former supreme deities of peaceful , woman-centered religions that turned into monsters when violent
