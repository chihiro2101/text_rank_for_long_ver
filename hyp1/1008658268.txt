the liquid is also colorless but can appear as a brownish yellow liquid due to the presence of no 2 according to the following equilibrium : : n 2 o 4 ⇌ 2 no 2 higher temperatures push the equilibrium towards nitrogen dioxide the oxidation of copper by nitric acid is a complex reaction forming various nitrogen oxides of varying stability which depends on the concentration of the nitric acid , presence of oxygen , and other factors nitrogen tetroxide is used as an oxidizer in one of the most important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature in early 1944 , research on the usability of dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizing agent for rocket fuel was conducted by german scientists , although the germans only used it to a very limited extent as an additive for s-stoff ( fuming nitric acid ) additionally , nto is often used with the addition of a small percentage of nitric oxide , which inhibits stress-corrosion cracking of titanium alloys , and in this form , propellant-grade nto is referred to as mixed oxides of nitrogen ( mon ) this hot nitrogen dioxide is expanded through a turbine , cooling it and lowering the pressure , and then cooled further in a heat sink , causing it to recombine into nitrogen tetroxide at the original molecular weight nitric acid is manufactured on a large scale via n 2 o 4 when exposed to oxygen , no is converted back into nitrogen dioxide : : 2 no + o 2 → 2 no 2 the resulting no 2 and n 2 o 4 can be returned to the cycle to give the mixture of nitrous and nitric acids again if metal nitrates are prepared from n 2 o 4 in completely anhydrous conditions , a range of covalent metal nitrates can be formed with many transition metals such compounds must be prepared in anhydrous conditions , since the nitrate ion is a much weaker ligand than water , and if water is present the simple hydrated nitrate will form international chemical safety card 0930 national pollutant inventory – oxides of nitrogen fact sheet niosh pocket guide to chemical hazards : nitrogen tetroxide air liquide gas encyclopedia : no 2 / n 2 o 4
