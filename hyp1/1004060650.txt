thompson excelled at his trade , and coming in contact with refined and well educated people for the first time , adopted many of their characteristics including an interest in science while recuperating in woburn in 1769 from an injury , thompson conducted experiments concerning the nature of heat and began to correspond with loammi baldwin and others about them when the american revolutionary war began thompson was a man of property and standing in new england and was opposed to the uprising while working with the british armies in america he conducted experiments to measure the force of gunpowder , the results of which were widely acclaimed when published in 1781 in the philosophical transactions of the royal society on the strength of this he arrived in london at the end of the war with a reputation as a scientist rumford ( 1786 ) '' new experiments upon heat '' philosophical transactions p.273 rumford ( 1792 ) '' experiments upon heat '' philosophical transactions of the royal society p.48-80 he further saw this as evidence of the argument from design , contending that divine providence had arranged for fur on animals in such a way as to guarantee their comfort rumford ( 1797 ) '' on the propagation of heat in fluids '' nicholson 's journal 1 pp298-341 the idea raised considerable objections from the scientific establishment , john dalton cardwell ( 1971 ) p.99 and john leslie making particularly forthright attacks rumford 's most important scientific work took place in munich , and centred on the nature of heat , which he contended in '' an experimental enquiry concerning the source of the heat which is excited by friction '' ( 1798 ) was not the caloric of then-current scientific thinking but a form of motion rumford confirmed that no physical change had taken place in the material of the cannon by comparing the specific heats of the material machined away and that remaining though this work met with a hostile reception , it was subsequently important in establishing the laws of conservation of energy later in the 19th century see note 8 , '' an enquiry concerning the nature of heat and the mode of its communication '' philosophical transactions of the royal society , starting at page 112 he invented a percolating coffee pot following his pioneering work with the bavarian army , where he improved the diet of the soldiers as well as their clothes the rumford fireplace created a sensation in london when he introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught , which was a much more efficient way to heat a room than earlier fireplaces his work was also very profitable , and much imitated when he published his analysis of the way chimneys worked in many ways , he was similar to benjamin franklin , who also invented a new kind of heating stove the retention of heat was a recurring theme in his work , as he is also credited with the invention of thermal underwear thompson also significantly improved the design of kilns used to produce quicklime , and rumford furnaces were soon being constructed throughout europe image : royal institution - humphry davy.jpg thumb right satirical cartoon by james gillray showing a royal institution lecture on pneumatics with davy holding the bellows and count rumford looking on at extreme right thompson separated from his second wife after 3 years , but he settled in paris and continued his scientific work until his death on august 21 , 1814 collected works of count rumford , volume ii , practical applications of heat , ( 1969 )
