one theory is that standing on one leg allows the birds to conserve more body heat , given that they spend a significant amount of time wading in cold water however , the behaviour also takes place in warm water and is also observed in birds that do not typically stand in water young flamingos hatch with grayish-red plumage , but adults range from light pink to bright red due to aqueous bacteria and beta-carotene obtained from their food supply captive flamingos are a notable exception ; they may turn a pale pink if they are not fed carotene at levels comparable to the wild vocalizations play an important role in parent-chick recognition , ritualized displays , and keeping large flocks together flamingos are very social birds ; they live in colonies whose population can number in the thousands these large colonies are believed to serve three purposes for the flamingos : avoiding predators , maximizing food intake , and using scarcely suitable nesting sites more efficiently these displays stimulate '' synchronous nesting '' ( see below ) and help pair up those birds that do not already have mates flamingos form strong pair bonds , although in larger colonies , flamingos sometimes change mates , presumably because more mates are available to choose '' what 19 years of observation on captive great flamingos suggests about adaptations to breeding under irregular conditions copulation usually occurs during nest building , which is sometimes interrupted by another flamingo pair trying to commandeer the nesting site for their use both the male and the female feed their chicks with a kind of crop milk , produced in glands lining the whole of the upper digestive tract ( not just the crop ) the mirrors are thought to give the flamingos the impression that they are in a larger flock than they actually are they placed emphasis on animals , and often depicted flamingos in their art
