mpeg-7 is intended to provide complementary functionality to the previous mpeg standards , representing information about the content , not the content itself ( '' the bits about the bits '' ) the representation of audio-visual data in terms of objects , is however very well suited to what will be built on the mpeg-7 standard in addition , mpeg-7 descriptions could be used to improve the functionality of previous mpeg standards.with these tools , we can build an mpeg-7 description and deploy it an mpeg-7 architecture requirement is that description must be separate from the audiovisual content there are many applications and application domains which will benefit from the mpeg-7 standard the first commercial mpeg-7 application , frameline 47 uses an advanced content schema based on mpeg-7 so as to be able to notate entire video files , or segments and groups of segments from within that video file according to the mpeg-7 convention ( commercial tool ) eptascape ads200 uses a real-time mpeg 7 encoder on an analog camera video signal to identify interesting events , especially in surveillance applications , check the demos to see mpeg-7 in action ( commercial tool ) ibm videoannex annotation tool : creating mpeg-7 documents for video streams describing structure and giving keywords from a controlled vocabulary ( binary release , restrictive license ) ifinder medienanalyse- und retrievalsystem : metadata extraction and search engine based on mpeg-7 ( commercial tool ) mpeg-7 audio encoder : creating mpeg-7 documents for audio documents describing low level audio characteristics ( binary & source release , java , gpl ) mpeg-7 visual descriptor extraction : software to extract mpeg-7 visual descriptors from images and image regions xm feature extraction web service : the functionalities of the experimentation model ( xm ) are made available via web service interface to enable automatic mpeg-7 low-level visual description characterization of images all 17 mpeg-7 low level audio descriptors are implemented ( commercial ) tu berlin mpeg-7 spoken content demonstrator ( web-demo ) : creating mpeg-7 documents ( xml ) with spokencontent description from an input speech signal ( wav , mp3 ) ( commercial ) mp7jrs c++ library complete mpeg-7 implementation of part 3 , 4 and 5 ( visual , audio and mds ) by joanneum research institute for information and communication technologies - audiovisual media group bilvideo-7 : mpeg-7 compatible , distributed video indexing and retrieval system , supporting complex , multimodal , composite queries ; developed by bilkent university multimedia database group ( bilmdg ) exif id3 metadata standards mpeg-4 part 11 – scene description and application engine multimedia information retrieval query by humming ” to address this issue , there were many attempts to map the mpeg-7 xml schema to the web ontology language ( owl ) , which is a structured data equivalent of the terms of the mpeg-7 standard ( mpeg-7ontos , comm , swinto , etc in other words , annotating an automatically extracted video feature , such as color distribution , does not provide the meaning of the actual visual content
