it is new latin from ancient greek κάρυον karyon , '' kernel '' , '' seed '' , or '' nucleus '' , and τύπος typos , '' general form '' ) the next stage took place after the development of genetics in the early 20th century , when it was appreciated that chromosomes ( that can be observed by karyotype ) were the carrier of genes in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question : how many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain ? in 1912 , hans von winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in spermatogonia and 48 in oogonia , concluding an xx/xo sex determination mechanism joe hin tjio working in albert levan 's lab found the chromosome count to be 46 using new techniques available at the time : using cells in tissue culture pretreating cells in a hypotonic solution , which swells them and spreads the chromosomes arresting mitosis in metaphase by a solution of colchicine squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes human chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral evidence of common ancestry : human chromosome 2 ( video ) 2007 the study of karyotypes is made possible by staining for humans , white blood cells are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in tissue culture sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing ( interphase ) cells six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared : differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes faba chromosomes are many times larger these differences probably reflect different amounts of dna duplication differences in basic number of chromosomes these differences could have resulted from successive unequal translocations which removed all the essential genetic material from a chromosome , permitting its loss without penalty to the organism ( the dislocation hypothesis ) or through fusion human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes , and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes heterochromatin consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive dna sequences as well as containing a larger amount of adenine-thymine pairs a full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number , type , shape and banding of the chromosomes , as well as other cytogenetic information variation is often found : between the sexes , between the germ-line and soma ( between gametes and the rest of the body ) , between members of a population ( polymorphism ( biology ) ) , in allopatric speciation , and in mosaics or otherwise abnormal individuals approximately 1.7 % percent of humans are intersex , sometimes due to variations in sex chromosomes there is variation between species in chromosome number , and in detailed organization , despite their construction from the same chromatin in some cases there is even significant variation within species in some species , as in many sciaridae , entire chromosomes are eliminated during development this process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain heterochromatin regions are lost the inactivation of one x chromosome takes place during the early development of mammals ( see barr body and dosage compensation ) the existence of supernumerary or b chromosomes means that chromosome number can vary even within one interbreeding population ; and aneuploids are another example , though in this case they would not be regarded as normal members of the population humans have fn 82 , due to the presence of five acrocentric chromosome pairs : 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , and 22 ( the human y chromosome is also acrocentric ) polyploidy in animals is much less common , but it has been significant in some groups polyploid series in related species which consist entirely of multiples of a single basic number are known as euploid the cells do not always contain exact multiples ( powers of two ) , which is why the simple definition 'an increase in the number of chromosome sets caused by replication without cell division ' is not quite accurate aneuploidy is the condition in which the chromosome number in the cells is not the typical number for the species abnormalities in chromosome number usually cause a defect in development aneuploidy may also occur within a group of closely related species human chromosome 2 was formed by a merger of ancestral chromosomes , reducing the number the detailed study of chromosome banding in insects with polytene chromosomes can reveal relationships between closely related species : the classic example is the study of chromosome banding in hawaiian drosophila by hampton l chromosome rearrangements , especially inversions , make it possible to see which species are closely related the inversions , when plotted in tree form ( and independent of all other information ) , show a clear '' flow '' of species from older to newer islands a range of different chromosome treatments produce a range of banding patterns : g-bands , r-bands , c-bands , q-bands , t-bands and nor-bands this method will normally produce 300–400 bands in a normal , human genome each of them produces its specific pattern numerical abnormalities , also known as aneuploidy , often occur as a result of nondisjunction during meiosis in the formation of a gamete ; trisomy , in which three copies of a chromosome are present instead of the usual two , are common numerical abnormalities both types of abnormalities can occur in gametes and therefore will be present in all cells of an affected person 's body , or they can occur during mitosis and give rise to a genetic mosaic individual who has some normal and some abnormal cells
