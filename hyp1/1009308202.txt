adam smith , in his seminal work the wealth of nations , described wealth as '' the annual produce of the land and labour of the society '' in popular usage , wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic value , or the state of controlling or possessing such items , usually in the form of money , real estate and personal property an individual who is considered wealthy , affluent , or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group wealth provides a type of individual safety net of protection against an unforeseen decline in one 's living standard in the event of job loss or other emergency and can be transformed into home ownership , business ownership , or even a college education a wealthy individual , community , or nation thus has more accumulated resources ( capital ) than a poor one the term implies a social contract on establishing and maintaining ownership in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner however , such an amount would constitute an extraordinary amount of wealth in impoverished developing country concepts of wealth also vary across time this comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future ; given this trend of human advancement , it is possible that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations however , physical capital , as it came to be known , consisting of both the natural capital and the infrastructural capital , became the focus of the analysis of wealth adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials , labour , land , and technology in such a way as to capture a profit ( excess above the cost of production ) marxian economics ( see labor theory of value ) distinguishes in the grundrisse between material wealth and human wealth , defining human wealth as '' wealth in human relations '' ; land and labour were the source of all material wealth having a leading position in the development of rational sciences , in new technologies and in economic production leads to wealth , while the opposite can be correlated with poverty the invention of coined money and banking was particularly important in that way , money also enables a new type of economic society and the definition of wealth in measurable quantities , such as gold and money in economics , wealth ( in a commonly applied accounting sense , sometimes savings ) is the net worth of a person , household , or nation â€“ that is , the value of all assets owned net of all liabilities owed at a point in time the term may also be used more broadly as referring to the productive capacity of a society or as a contrast to poverty accounting measures net worth in terms of the historical cost of assets while economics measures wealth in terms of current values but analysis may adapt typical accounting conventions for economic purposes in social accounting ( such as in national accounts ) an example of the latter is generational accounting of social security systems to include the present value projected future outlays considered to be liabilities environmental assets are not usually counted in measuring wealth , in part due to the difficulty of valuation for a non-market good partly as a result of different economic conditions of life , members of different social classes often have different value systems and view the world in different ways upper class encompasses the top end of the income spectrum relative members of society as a whole upper class values include higher education , and for the wealthiest people the accumulation and maintenance of wealth , the maintenance of social networks and the power that accompanies such networks it is in large part by accessing various edifices of information , associates , procedures and auspices that the upper class are able to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations the middle class places a greater emphasis on income : unlike the upper class , the middle class measures success and potential in the form of money rather than influence and power there are many societal standards and designs intentional sabotage and shortcomings to explain the persistent state of yearning and want the lower classes generally experience with their lower quality and quantity of assets in the western tradition , the concepts of owning land and accumulating wealth in the form of land were engendered in the rise of the first state , for a primary service and power of government was , and is to this day , the awarding and adjudication of land use rights he claimed that because we mix our labour with the land , we thereby deserve the right to control the use of the land and benefit from the product of that land ( but subject to his lockean proviso of '' at least where there is enough , and as good left in common for others additionally , in developed countries post-agrarian society ( industrial society ) this argument has many critics ( including those influenced by georgist and geolibertarian ideas ) who argue that since land , by definition , is not a product of human labor , any claim of private property in it is a form of theft ; as david lloyd george observed , '' to prove a legal title to land one must trace it back to the man who stole it the high artisan skill also suggest the capacity to direct specialized labor to tasks that are not of any obvious utility to the group 's survival however , physical capital , as it came to be known , consisting of both the natural capital ( raw materials from nature ) and the infrastructural capital ( facilitating technology ) , became the focus of the analysis of wealth adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials , labour , land , and technology in such a way as to capture a profit ( excess above the cost of production ) gross national happiness happiness economics productivity improving technologies ( historical ) quality of life working time list of wealthiest historical figures
