a new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna , which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the university of waterloo in 2004 for instance , one bbc news downlink shows a '' red signal '' being received by the lnbf directly instead of being beamed to the dish , which because of its parabolic shape will collect the signal into a smaller area and deliver it to the lnbf modern dishes intended for home television use are generally 43 & nbsp ; cm ( 18 & nbsp ; in ) to 80 & nbsp ; cm ( 31 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter , and are fixed in one position , for ku-band reception from one orbital position prior to the existence of direct broadcast satellite services , home users would generally have a motorised c-band dish of up to 3 m in diameter for reception of channels from different satellites only one of these frequency bands fits on the coaxial cable , so each of these bands needs a separate cable from the lnbf to a switching matrix or the receiver needs to select one of the 4 possibilities at a time professional satellite finder meters allow better dish alignment and provide received signal parameter values as well with diseqc and usals , the satellite dish will automatically aim itself at one of sixteen satellites programmed in previously when pressing one of the channel buttons on the remote right every standard-size dish enables simultaneous reception from multiple different satellite positions without re-positioning the dish , just by adding additional lnb or using special duo lnb , triple , or four feed monoblock lnb most receivers sold presently are compatible with at least diseqc 1.0 , which can switch automatically between 4 satellites ( all of contemporary monoblock lnbs ) as the user changes channels using the remote control motor-driven dishes assure better optimal focusing for the given dish size ; lnb is always in central alignment with the broadcasting satellite , but diseqc switches are faster than diseqc motors as no physical movement is required these antennas vary from in most applications though c-band vsats may be as large as the first satellite television dishes were built to receive signals on the c-band analog , and were very large the relatively strong k u band transmissions allowed the use of dishes as small as 90 & nbsp ; cm for the first time this was the first widely used direct-broadcast satellite television system and allowed dishes as small as 20 & nbsp ; inches to be used this great decrease of dish size also allowed satellite dishes to be installed on vehicles television stations , however , still prefer to transmit their signals on the c-band analog with large dishes due to the fact that c-band signals are less prone to rain fade than k u band signals .
