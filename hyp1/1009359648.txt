although it is claimed that rogers was the first person to ever print a complete english bible that was translated directly from the original greek and hebrew , there was also a reliance upon a latin translation of the hebrew bible by sebastian münster and published in 1534/5 the pseudonym '' matthew '' is associated with rogers , but it seems more probable that matthew stands for tyndale 's own name , which , back then , was dangerous to employ in england one source states that he '' assembled '' the bible his work was largely used by those who prepared the great bible ( 1539–40 ) , and this eventually led to the bishops ' bible ( 1568 ) and the king james version a number of leading protestant figures , including john rogers , were arrested and leading reformist bishops such as john hooper and hugh latimer were imprisoned weeks later after joan bocher was imprisoned in 1548 and convicted in april 1549 , john foxe , one of the few protestants opposed to burnings , approached rogers to intervene to save joan , but he refused with the comment that burning was '' sufficiently mild '' for a crime as grave as heresy in december 1554 , parliament re-enacted the penal statutes against lollards , and on 22 january 1555 , two days after they took effect , rogers ( with ten other people ) came before the council at gardiner 's house in southwark , and defended himself in the examination that took place on 28 and 29 january he came before the commission appointed by reginald pole , and was sentenced to death by gardiner for heretically denying the christian character of the church of rome and the real presence in the sacrament p 33 bishop thomas cranmer who had encouraged the matthew bible , was executed in 1556 also by queen mary i of england he also spoke of the support given to rogers by the greatest part of the people : '' even his children assisted at it , comforting him in such a manner that it seemed as if he had been led to a wedding '' from the scriptures he knew that unlawful vows may be lawfully broken ; hence he married , and removed to wittenberg in saxony , for the improvement of learning ; and he there learned the dutch language , and received the charge of a congregation , which he faithfully executed for many years on king edward 's accession , he left saxony to promote the work of reformation in england ; and , after some time , nicholas ridley , then bishop of london , gave him a prebend in st rogers having preached at paul 's cross , after queen mary arrived at the tower , has been already stated the proclamation of the queen , however , to prohibit true preaching , gave his enemies a new handle against him rogers had been long and straitly imprisoned , and lodged in newgate among thieves , often examined , and very uncharitably entreated , and at length unjustly and most cruelly condemned by stephen gardiner , bishop of winchester , the fourth day of february , in the year of our lord 1555 , being monday in the morning , he was suddenly warned by the keeper of newgate 's wife , to prepare himself for the fire ; who , being then sound asleep , could scarce be awaked rogers replied that he might speak a few words with his wife before his burning , but that could not be obtained of him when the time came that he should be brought out of newgate to smithfield , the place of his execution , mr woodroofe , one of the sheriffs , first came to mr he was the first martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in queen mary 's time that gave the first adventure upon the fire
