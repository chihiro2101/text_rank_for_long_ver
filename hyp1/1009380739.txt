in the last decades of the eighteenth century the percolation of age of enlightenment and the dramas of american revolution and the french revolution stimulated in britain , as elsewhere in europe , new clubs and societies committed to principles of popular sovereignty and constitutional government at the first meeting of his '' correspondence society '' on january 25 , 1792 , hardy led seven friends in a discussion that determined that '' gross ignorance and prejudice in the bulk of the nation was the greatest obstacle to obtaining redress '' from the '' defects and abuses that have crept into the administration of our government '' ; and that to remove that obstacle it should be the aim of those subscribing : to instil into the public in a legal and constitutional way by means of the press , a sense of their rights as freemen , and of their duty to themselves and their posterity , as good citizens , and hereditary guardians of the liberties transmitted to them by their forefathers appendix hardy is said to have been distinguished in radical company by never speaking '' but to the purpose at hand '' and by his '' high organising ability '' but in promoting the new society , he and his friends rode a wave of popular political engagement lifted by the two-part publication ( march 1791 , february 1792 ) of thomas paine 's rights of man in addition to domestic subversion , the state authorities feared collaboration with french agents , against whose entry and circulation within the country they had introduced the aliens act 1793 each division met twice a week to conduct business and discuss historical and political texts the height of its popularity in late 1795 it may have had between 3,500 and 5000 member organised in 79 divisions iain hampsher-monk , the impact of

forum for '' a politically conscious and articulate artisan population '' , men of a more prominent social and professional standing did join , drawn in many cases from existing debating societies drawing on abolitionist networks he brokered connections for the lcs , including what may have been the society 's first contacts with the united irishmen despite such notaries , the government were assured by their most trusted informer , '' 'citizen ' groves '' , that the real body of the club was made of '' the very lowest order of society '' they took little persuading that within the lcs english jacobins were leading on the equivalent to the sans-culottes of the revolutionary paris sections at the end of november 1792 the lcs published an address of the london corresponding society to the other societies of great britain , united for obtaining a reform in parliament expressing confidence in the prospects for obtaining a reformed , democratic franchise through '' moral force the lcs delegates ' host in the scottish capital , and perhaps the most radical delegate present , thomas muir of the society of the friends of the people , himself said nothing that was not strictly constitutional an address which he presented from the united irishmen ( largely drawn up by william drennan ) was made acceptable to the convention only by redacting any suggestion of '' treason or misprison of treason against the union of scotland with england '' beginning with the title '' convention '' , and including an oath to '' live free or die '' , the '' imitation of french forms '' did cause the authorities some alarm by the time lcs delegates attended their second reform convention in edinburgh in october 1793 , the political climate had changed dramatically at a time when reformers were beginning to mobilise a broad swath of opinion in britain in favour of a reformed parliament and a strictly constitutional monarchy , they were being forced , by their early embrace of the french revolution , to defend policies in france they did not advocate at home : the execution of the king and of regime opponents , the confiscation of the property of the church and nobility the trial of william skirving , secretary to the british convention , before the high court of justice , on 6th-7th of january ,1794 , for sedition , containing a full and circumstantial account of all the proceedings and speeches , as taken down in shorthand by mr ramsey , short hand writer from london gerrald had published earlier in the year a convention the only means of saving us from ruin in london , hardy and margarot 's successor as chairman , john baxter , undaunted , had drawn up addresses to '' the friends of peace and parliamentary reform '' and to '' his majesty '' calling for an end to the war against france in may 1794 , hard on the committee 's '' report on radical and reform societies '' , national archives ( uk ) , '' report on radical and reform societies , 1794 '' , accessed 5 december 2020 the juries in london were not as ready as those in edinburgh to accept the mere expression of political opinion as evidence of plots against king and parliament on his release , hardy did not return to his position in the society the lcs bookseller john smith provocatively renamed his shop the pop gun , and sold a pamphlet that explained that the government required three instruments : 1 ) soldiers ( '' by profession slaughters '' , 2 ) clergymen ( who '' hallow with the sanction of divinity state robbery '' ) , and 3 ) lawyers ( who '' thrive on misery '' and are the '' tyrants of property '' ) in prison , and prior to an obscure american exile , he had produced his second great work , published in 1796 and 1797 prominent among them was richard lee , a bookseller reputedly expelled from the lsc for refusing to stock paine 's newest work and yet subsequently prosecuted for publishing the regicidal handbill king killing , and edward iliff 's a summary of the duties of citizenship , written expressly for the members of the london corresponding society meetings were held at furnival â€™ s inn , holborn , where united delegates from london , scotland and the regions were reported to have committed themselves '' to overthrow the present government , and to join the french as soon as they made a landing in england '' ( in december 1796 only weather had prevented a major french landing in ireland ) yet the disillusionment with france was widespread and by the time of coigly 's arrest the majority view was that the entire business of coordinating with the directory and the united irish was a destructive diversion according to francis place ( who , for the good name of the lcs and the reform movement as a whole , had threatened to inform on united conspirators ) this stroke extinguished the society members made no attempt to meet again , not even in any division and abandoned their delegates thompson identified the london corresponding society as a key incident in the emergence of a '' working-class consciousness '' in england francis place survived to be active in the agitation for the first of these , the reform act of 1832 in 1839 , he was invited by the london working men 's association to become one of the london delegates to the national convention of what might be considered as the industrial working-class continuity of the correspondence movement of the 1790s , the chartism
