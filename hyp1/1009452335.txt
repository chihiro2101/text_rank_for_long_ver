charles ii of spain succession dispute in 1700 , and fourteen years of war were the result france and great britain had come to terms in october 1711 , when the preliminaries of peace had been signed in london one of the first questions discussed was the nature of the guarantees to be given by france and spain that their crowns would be kept separate , and little progress was made until 10 july 1712 , when philip signed a renunciation spain under philip v signed separate peace treaties with savoy and great britain at utrecht on 13 july france signed treaties of commerce and navigation with great britain and the netherlands ( 11 april 1713 ) great britain signed a like treaty with spain ( 9 december 1713 ) britain was the main beneficiary , utrecht marking the point at which it became the primary european commercial power under article xiii , spain agreed to a british demand they preserve catalan constitutions , in return for catalan support for the allies during the war the successful french rhine campaign ( 1713 ) finally induced charles to sign the 1714 treaties of rastatt and baden , although terms were not agreed with spain until the 1720 treaty of the hague however , in the parliament of 1710 the tory had gained control of the house of commons , and they wished for an end to great britain 's participation in a european war although the fate of the spanish netherlands in particular was of interest to the united provinces , dutch influence on the outcome of the negotiations was fairly insignificant , even though the talks were held on their territory the state policy of modern europe from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the present time image : allegory on the peace of utrecht.jpg thumb right allegory of the peace of utrecht by antoine rivalz the treaty stipulated that '' because of the great danger which threatened the liberty and safety of all europe , from the too close conjunction of the kingdoms of spain and france , for the individual signatories , britain established naval superiority over its competitors , commercial access to spanish america , and control of menorca and gibraltar ; it retains the latter territory to this day france accepted the protestant succession , ensuring a smooth transition when anne died in august 1714 and ended support for the stuarts under the 1716 anglo-french treaty spain retained the majority of its empire and recovered remarkably quickly ; the recapture of naples and sicily in 1718 was only prevented by british naval power and a second attempt was successful in 1734 despite failure in spain , austria secured its position in italy and hungary , allowing them to continue expansion into areas of south-east europe previously held by the ottoman empire attempts to ensure her succession involved austria in wars of little strategic value , much of the fighting in the 1733â€“1735 war of the polish succession taking place in their maritime provinces in italy while the final settlement at utrecht was far more favourable than the allied offer of 1709 , france gained little that had not already been achieved through diplomacy by february 1701
