even as his symptoms began to wane in his teenage years , he ran into trouble as a budding historian ; his work on a history of the roman civil wars was too truthful and too critical of the reigning emperor augustus , and his mother antonia minor and grandmother livia quickly put a stop to it claudius was portrayed this way by scholars for most of history , and graves uses these peculiarities to develop a sympathetic character whose survival in a murderous dynasty depends upon his family 's incorrect assumption that he is a harmless idiot graves translated suetonius before writing the novels and claimed that after reading suetonius , claudius came to him in a dream one night and demanded that his real story be told the life of claudius provided graves with a way to write about the first four emperors of rome from an intimate point of view the real claudius was a trained historian and is known to have written an autobiography ( now lost ) in eight books that covered the same period the penultimate verse concerns his reign and claudius assumes that he can tell the identity of the last emperor described in the prophecy graves establishes a fatalistic tone that plays out at the end of claudius the god when claudius correctly predicts his assassination and succession by nero claudius believes this means that his secret memoirs will one day be found and that he , having written the truth , will speak clearly , while his contemporaries , who had to distort their histories to appease the ruling family , will seem like stammerers since he wishes to record his life for posterity , claudius explains that he chooses to write in greek , which he believes will remain '' the chief literary language of the world '' writing in the first-person ( from an unspecified time period , presumably late in his own reign as emperor ) , claudius establishes himself as the author of this history of his family and insists on writing the truth , which includes harsh criticisms of the deified augustus and especially of livia the narrative begins prior to his own birth , as he describes many of the events leading to the foundation of the roman principate and the increasingly firm emplacement of augustus as emperor despite augustus ' own publicly expressed intention to eventually restore the former republic he is eventually given a great tutor , the reputable historian athenodorus , who fosters a love of history and republican government in the young claudius upon augustus ' death , tiberius is declared emperor , though his mother livia retains her power and influence as empress he sends his wife agrippina and youngest son caligula away from the military frontier and asks claudius for an enormous sum of money to pay the soldiers caligula is declared emperor and at first appears to be enlightened and kind to his surprise , claudius is recalled to rome from his peaceful life in capua writing history and living with his prostitute companion calpurnia claudius quickly becomes the butt of many taunts and practical jokes by the imperial court the story begins with an apology by claudius for having ended his first history on a dramatic point and continues with a brief history of his friend herod agrippa herod is in rome when caligula is assassinated and quickly is able to convince claudius to accept the emperorship in order to avoid civil war messalina is executed without claudius ' consent and claudius has no reaction during his '' olympian '' state , even bemusedly joking about being worshipped as a god in britain on being relieved of the '' olympian mixture '' , claudius is crushed and decides that the only way the republic can be restored is by having a true mad monarch rather than the reign of a benevolent one comparing himself to the fable of the frogs who desired a king , claudius privately refers to himself as '' old king log '' and plays a weak and easily manipulated fool in his feeble old age claudius excessively enjoys gladiatorial games , is often intoxicated , and makes himself oblivious to agrippinilla 's schemes to gain power and make her son nero emperor foreseeing that nero will be a terrible ruler , claudius plans on having his son britannicus removed to live with the northern britons and later to return as rome 's saviour claudius resignedly accepts that his death will be soon with numerous signs suggesting such i claudia , a 2018 novel by mary mccoy was loosely based on i , claudius and translates the characters into a modern day private high school with a problematic power structure martin , the author of the song of ice and fire series , has spoken of how he was inspired by i , claudius , in particular , central character stannis baratheon is partially based upon tiberius , particularly as portrayed by george baker in the bbc television series
