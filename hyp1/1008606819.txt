he had been inspired by television shows he had seen in the united states and argentina but , as he explained , '' my idea was mixing all the programs that i saw into one program for several years , two programs were recorded each week from identical sets : one in miami , florida for broadcast in most latin american countries , as well as canada , and europe one of the show 's signature segments , six contestants are given the chance to sing a song , with the bad performers being eliminated mid-song by '' el chacal '' , a ghost-like character who blows an old trumpet to end such acts ( similar to the gong show ) unlike the gong show , el chacal does not have to wait a specific amount of time before eliminating someone ( on many occasions , contestants have been eliminated almost immediately after beginning their performance ) the performer also has the chance to win an additional 1,000 by acquiring '' la corona '' , which would pre-qualify that performer into the '' reyes del chacal '' competition , which is held every two to four years ( although this competition has not been held since 2010 ) he would also kick the character if a bad call was made the contest is usually held the saturday before the miss venezuela , miss usa and miss universe pageants , although it – or variants of the segment – are frequently held every two to four weeks another version , '' miss colita petite '' , features mainly smaller women don francisco had stated that the popularity of the song ( and its accompanying dance ) saved the program from an early cancellation in 1987 , although this was not publicly revealed until 2012 , during the show 's 50th anniversary celebration don francisco precedes the sketch by calling one of the characters , while each sketch would end in bad luck this sketch was known for its suggestive/risqué themes , as la doctora cosabella ( played by guerrero ) would often strip into her lingerie ( whenever someone in the hospital shouts '' mequetrefe '' ) it was followed by two '' sequels '' , la posada and don medical center , the latter a reboot of hospital gigante , while hill later reprised his role as the '' nice to meet you '' character from 2013 until the show 's cancellation in 2015 during la cuatro 's segments with don francisco another game , los huevos de ron magill ( named after magill himself ) , has audience members attempt to replicate an animal 's sound which , if one is performed successfully , then that person can reach their hand in an oversized egg for a chance to win up to us 1500 it is noted that magill had also been frequently criticized by don francisco , as well as ( in some occasions ) made fun of by the audience due to his poor spanish-speaking ability ( despite magill 's first language being spanish during childhood ) the contests have included the following : solteras sin compromiso : a competition involving single women vying to win a date with one of the single men featured in the segment this competition was primarily played in the chilean version during the early years of the program a similar contest played in the univision version , solteros y solteras features single men and women and uses a battle of the sexes format it has been revealed that the winning contestants have to wait 30 days for their cars to be delivered to them and that the actual car varied from the one shown in the program in the chilean version , cars may be used as one of the regular prizes during some of the games in 2000 and from 2005-2009 , another car prize ( usually from a different manufacturer ) was offered at the end of the first hour of the show prior to the revamping in 2008 , the games played for the car were similar to the pricing games seen on the price is right , but were based on luck rather than having the contestant guess the actual price of the car a similar version was played in chile and in some occasions on the univision version , where don francisco uses a pistol and the contestant would lose if the pistol fired contestants can call out digits one at a time , revealing them in the retail prices of four prizes on the gameboard , and wins the first prize whose price is completely revealed another game involved 10 keys with the contestant having to choose the key ( with a set number of chances ) that opens the large '' vault '' containing the car inside ( similar to the price is rights '' master key '' and '' safe crackers '' pricing games ) this game was considered the most popular car game of the show and is the first car game played this game now appears occasionally , with all finalists each picking the key they believe opens the car door there are games similar to the price is rights '' 3 strikes '' pricing game , but gameplay varied depending on that game 's concept ( with the el chacal de la trompeta character image used as the '' strikes '' ; if the contestant finds the sábado gigante logo , it will eliminate one strike and awards a 500 bonus , which the contestant gets to keep regardless of outcome ) if the player successfully finds all 7 parts of a digitalized car without finding el chacal 3 times , the player wins a brand-new car and whatever money has been accumulated ( up to 7,000 ) the older version has players spell out the word '' gigante '' , similar to the price is rights '' spelling bee '' pricing game and is played using the 3 strikes each parts of a car adds 1,000 to the player 's score , and if the contestant successfully stops at the car space 5 times without stopping at the '' chacal '' space 3 times , the contestant wins a brand-new car and whatever money has accumulated additionally , the 1998-99 version also had the actual car center stage , with the wheel on the right side , drawings of cars on the top center and those of el chacal on the left the 2000-08 version was downsized to a single game board , eliminating the center stage there was another game in which a contestant picks a door up or down , and are then shown a number and the contestants are asked if the next door 's number is higher or lower the 1996-99 version was played differently , where the contestant must collect cards containing five pictures of a disproportionate car ( equaling 1 part each ) , with the adjacent card being a drawing of a monster ( named after el chacal de la trompeta despite it not looking like the character ) this version also became a playable game on the show 's website and was considered the most difficult game on the show the 2000-08 version is similar to the current format ( made in response to the difficulty of the first version ) and was first played using large playing cards ( with jacks , kings and queens being equal to 10 , and aces either 1 or 11 ; should multiple rows of cards contain the same number and all rows have exhausted before winning the car , the contestant wins whatever money accumulated ) la cámara viajera ( '' the traveling camera '' ) is the show 's travelogue segment – which only appears occasionally – where don francisco visits a selected country where he mainly talks about the culture and its attractions there also have been numerous talent competitions throughout the program 's run ( which are held every 1–4 years )
