because of the light loss due to all the filtering , autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films , which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used and that it was not practical to photograph moving subjects the plate was reversal-processed into a positive transparency — that is , the plate was first developed into a negative image but not '' fixed '' , then the silver forming the negative image was chemically removed , then the remaining silver halide was exposed to light and developed , producing a positive image when the finished image was viewed by transmitted light , each bit of the silver image acted as a micro-filter , allowing more or less light to pass through the corresponding colored starch grain , recreating the original proportions of the three colors experimentations within the early twentieth century provided solutions to many issues , including the addition of screen plates , a yellow filter designed to balance the blue , and adjustments to the size of the silver halide crystals to allow for a broader spectrum of colour and control over the frequency of light because the presence of the mosaic color screen made the finished autochrome image very dark overall , bright light and special viewing arrangements were needed for satisfactory results the user would place the diascope near a window or other light source so that light passed through the diffuser and the autochrome , and the resulting back-lit , dark-surrounded image would be viewed in the mirror slide projectors , then known as magic lanterns and stereopticons , were a less common but especially effective display technique , more suitable for public exhibitions american annual of photography , 1931 , 45:69 more than a few surviving autochromes suffer from such '' tanning '' and conventional projection is not a recommended means of displaying these irreplaceable images today the use of a '' light box '' or similar highly diffused artificial light source for viewing autochromes , although now nearly universal , is unfortunate , as the heavy scattering of light within and among the several layers of coatings on the plate degrades the color saturation making modern film or digital copies of autochromes introduces other problems , because a color system based on red , green , and blue is used to copy an image that exists within the red-orange , green , and blue-violet system , providing further opportunities for color degradation vintage reproductions of autochromes in old books and magazines have often been noticeably hand-adjusted by the photoengravers in an effort to compensate for some of the difficulties of reproduction , and as a result they sometimes look more like hand-colored photographs than '' natural color '' ones if an autochrome was well made and has been well preserved , color values can be very good the resulting '' dream-like '' impressionist quality may have been one reason behind the enduring popularity of the medium even after more starkly realistic color processes had become available nevertheless , the lumière products had a devoted following , above all in france , and their use persisted long after modern color films had become available the national geographic society made extensive use of autochromes and other mosaic color screen plates for over twenty years one of the first books published with color photography used this technique both the autochrome photograph of the humphrey children and the diascope mirror viewing device , which closes into itself in a leather-bound case similar in size and appearance to a book , are well preserved and still viewable in 2015 modern image sensors in digital cameras most commonly use a bayer filter , which works in essentially the same way as the colored starch grains in an autochrome plate—by breaking up the image into microscopically small color-filtered elements in physical arrangement , however , the bayer filter mosaic much more closely resembles the regular geometric pattern used in other color screen plates of the autochrome era , such as the paget and finlay plates
