additionally , if there is an entropy input while running , it should be infeasible to use knowledge of the input 's state to predict future conditions of the csprng state : : example : if the csprng under consideration produces output by computing bits of π in sequence , starting from some unknown point in the binary expansion , it may well satisfy the next-bit test and thus be statistically random , as π appears to be a random sequence the state of the algorithm ) is currently in use will be able to calculate all preceding bits as well first , while most prngs outputs appear random to assorted statistical tests , they do not resist determined reverse engineering specialized statistical tests may be found specially tuned to such a prng that shows the random numbers not to be truly random it has an uncontroversial design but has been proven to be weaker in terms of distinguishing attack , than the security level of the underlying block cipher when the number of bits output from this prng is greater than two to the power of the underlying block cipher 's block size in bits : when the maximum number of bits output from this prng is equal to the 2 blocksize , the resulting output delivers the mathematically expected security level that the key size would be expected to generate , but the output is shown to not be indistinguishable from a true random number generator when the maximum number of bits output from this prng is less than it , the expected security level is delivered and the output appears to be indistinguishable from a true random number generator there are also standards for statistical testing of new csprng designs : a statistical test suite for random and pseudorandom number generators , nist special publication 800-22 on october 23 , 2017 , shaanan cohney , matthew green , and nadia heninger , cryptographers at the university of pennsylvania and johns hopkins university released details of the duhk ( do n't use hard-coded keys ) attack on wpa2 where hardware vendors use a hardcoded seed key for the ansi x9.31 rng algorithm in conjunction with the usage of the ansi x9.31 random number generator , '' an attacker can brute-force encrypted data to discover the rest of the encryption parameters and deduce the master encryption key used to encrypt web sessions or virtual private network ( vpn ) connections
