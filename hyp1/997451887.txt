is a kind of diagram in which each line segment represents the world line of a '' unit '' ( either an elementary particle or a compound system of particles ) given any closed spin network , a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the norm of the spin network however , they imply that for a spin network to have nonzero norm , two requirements must be met at each vertex one computes holonomy of the connection along every link ( closed path ) of the graph , determines representation matrices corresponding to every link , multiplies all matrices and intertwiners together , and contracts indices in a prescribed way the set of all possible spin networks ( or , more accurately , '' s-knots '' that is , equivalence classes of spin networks under diffeomorphisms ) is countable ; it constitutes a basis of lqg hilbert space one of the key results of loop quantum gravity is quantization of areas : the operator of the area a of a two-dimensional surface σ should have a discrete spectrum according to this formula , the lowest possible non-zero eigenvalue of the area operator corresponds to a link that carries spin 1/2 representation the formula for area eigenvalues becomes somewhat more complicated if the surface is allowed to pass through the vertices , as with anomalous diffusion models one can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary '' quantum of volume '' and every link is a '' quantum of area '' surrounding this volume similar constructions can be made for general gauge theories with a compact lie group g and a connection form later , it was generalized by robert oeckl to representations of quantum groups in 2 and 3 dimensions using the tannaka–krein duality levin and xiao-gang wen have also defined string-nets using tensor category that are objects very similar to spin networks
