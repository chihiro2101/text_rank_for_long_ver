historians regard the events as having taken place during the early regal period , but the question of whether the events should be directly associated with tullus is debatable it was almost certainly subjugated at a later date than that given by livy and it may have been destroyed by the latins and not by the romans ( who might have regarded the destruction of their own traditional mother-country as impious ) after battling a long time , the last roman brother emerged as victor , thus rome and tullus hostilius won the battle for alba longa the alban dictator mettius fufetius betrayed rome during the war with the etruscans , where rome requested alban military assistance , which mettius agreed to , but also had a secret agreement with the etruscans to desert rome in the heat of battle , leaving tullus alone to fight the battle tullus 's second alleged historical accomplishment was the construction of the original roman senate house , the curia hostilia although that date falls well outside the traditionally-ascribed period of tullus hostilius ' reign , scholars are dubious regarding the tales of the overly-long reigns of the roman kings—with an average reign of 34 years-per-king , the traditional chronology would be without historical parallel ( the royal rulers of the remarkably stable and healthy english monarchy have an average reign of 21 years each ) it would also explain things which are otherwise puzzling : tullus 's name being attached to the building , and how , as roman traditions attest , tullus could have led rome 's successful wars against the fidenae and veii and the sabines hostilius was probably a historical figure , however , in the strict sense that a man bearing the name tullus hostilius likely reigned as king in rome however , at the close of his reign , rome was affected by a series of prophecies including a shower of stones on the monte cavo ( in response to which a public religious festival of nine days was held – a novendialis ) , a loud voice was heard on the summit of the mount complaining that the albans had failed to show devotion to their former gods , and a pestilence struck in rome there are two versions concerning the death of tullus hostilius and his family , the first one consists of a myth that his house was hit by lightning and everyone with the house was killed and the house burnt to the ground with no survivors
