the model 200 featured piano key style transport controls , with the model 201 using the distinctive combination of a separate lever for rewind/fast forward and the large play and stop button as found on their commercial reel to reel machines of the era cassette decks soon came into widespread use and were designed variously for professional applications , home audio systems , and for mobile use in cars , as well as portable recorders cassette decks were eventually manufactured by almost every well known brand in home audio , and many in professional audio , with each company offering models of very high quality in the car stereo industry , full logic control was developed with the aim of miniaturization , so that the cassette deck would take up less dashboard space this allows different record and playback head gaps to be used fonoforum.de 8/1991 , testreport dolby-s-kassettendeck ( german ; pdf , 2 mb ) the dolby noise reduction system was key to realizing low noise performance on slow , narrow , cassette tapes most auto-reverse machines use a four channel head ( similar to those on multitrack recorders ) , with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time , one pair for each direction most recent decks produce the best response and dynamic headroom with metal tapes ( iec type iv ) which require still higher bias for recording , though they will play back correctly at the ii setting since the equalization is the same with all of these improvements , the best units could record and play the full audible spectrum from 20 & nbsp ; hz to over 20 & nbsp ; khz ( although this was commonly quoted at -10 , -20 or even -30 & nbsp ; db , not at full output level ) , with wow ( recording ) less than 0.05 % and very low noise a high-quality recording on cassette could rival the sound of an average commercial cd , though the quality of pre-recorded cassettes has been regarded by the general public as lower than could be achieved in a quality home recording a variety of noise reduction and other schemes are used to increase fidelity , with dolby b being almost universal for both prerecorded tapes and home recording dolby b was designed to address the high-frequency noise inherent in cassette tapes , and along with improvements in tape formulation it helped the cassette win acceptances as a high-fidelity medium at the same time , dolby b provided acceptable performance when played back on decks that lacked dolby circuitry , meaning there was little reason not to use it if it was available philips developed an alternative noise reduction system known as dynamic noise limiter ( dnl ) which did not require the tapes to be processed during recording ; this was also the basis of the later dnr noise reduction it was only licensed for use on higher end tape decks that included dual motors , triple heads , and other refinements by the late 1980s , thanks to such improvements in the electronics , the tape material and manufacturing techniques , as well as dramatic improvements to the precision of the cassette shell , tape heads and transport mechanics , sound fidelity on equipment from the top manufacturers far surpassed the levels originally expected of the medium whereas dolby b was already in widespread use in the 1970s , prerecorded cassettes were duplicated onto rather poor quality tape stock at ( often ) high speed and did not compare in fidelity to high-grade lps however , systems such as xdr , along with the adoption of higher-grade tape ( such as chromium dioxide , but typically recorded in such a way as to play back at the normal 120 Î¼s position ) , and the frequent use of dolby hx pro , meant that cassettes became a viable high-fidelity option , one that was more portable and required less maintenance than records a key element of the cassette 's success was its use in in-car entertainment systems , where the small size of the tape was significantly more convenient than the competing 8-track cartridge system cassette tape adaptors have been developed which allow newer media players to be played through existing cassette decks , in particular those in cars which generally do not have input jacks cassette equipment needs regular maintenance , as cassette tape is a magnetic medium which is in physical contact with the tape head and other metallic parts of the recorder/player mechanism philips responded with the digital compact cassette , a system which was backward-compatible with existing analog cassette recordings for playback , but it failed to garner a significant market share and was withdrawn one reason proposed for the lack of acceptance of digital recording formats such as dat was a fear by content providers that the ability to make very high quality copies would hurt sales of copyrighted recordings a contributing factor may have been the inability of early cd players to reliably read discs with surface damage and offer anti-skipping features for applications where external vibration would be present , such as automotive and recreation environments early cd playback equipment also tended to be expensive compared to cassette equipment of similar quality and did not offer recording capability many home and portable entertainment systems supported both formats and commonly allowed the cd playback to be recorded on cassette tape the rise of inexpensive all-solid-state portable digital music systems based on mp3 , aac and similar formats finally saw the eventual decline of the domestic cassette deck as radios became tightly integrated into dashboards , many cars lacked even standard openings that would accept aftermarket cassette player installations many blind and elderly people find the newest digital technologies very difficult to use compared to the cassette format today , cassette decks are not considered by most people to be either the most versatile or highest fidelity sound recording devices available , as even very inexpensive cd or digital audio players can reproduce a wide frequency range with no speed variations many current budget-oriented cassette decks lack a tape selector to set proper bias and equalization settings to take best advantage of the extended high end of type ii high bias and type iv metal bias tapes
