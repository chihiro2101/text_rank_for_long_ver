they are typically used ( and sold ) in sets of four and five , and are commonly used for circular knitting double-pointed needles are somewhat shorter than single-pointed or circular needles , and are usually used in the 13â€“20 & nbsp ; cm length range , although they are also made longer a cable needle is a special type of double-pointed needle that is typically very short and used to hold a very small number of stitches temporarily while the knitter is forming a cable pattern they are often u-shaped , or have a u-shaped bend , to keep the held stitches from falling off while the primary needle is being used circulars are composed of two pointed , straight tips connected by a flexible cable and may be used for both knitting flat or knitting in the round the ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting , such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting in using circulars to knit flat pieces of fabric the two ends are used just as two separate needles would be using circular needles has some advantages , for example , the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed , therefore less taxing , on the arms and wrists of the knitter and , the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms one common method is to use two needles in place of the four or five double-pointed needles traditionally used , while a newer technique is to use one circular needle that is significantly longer than the circumference of the item being knitted this technique is known as magic loop and has recently become a popular method of producing tubular knitting , as only one needle is required some may also be used to gauge the size of crochet hooks most needles come with the size written on them , but with use and time , the label often wears off , and many needles ( like double-pointed needles ) tend not to be labelled there are holes of various sizes through which the needles are passed to determine which hole they fit best , and often a ruler along the edge for determining the tension ( also called gauge ) of a sample there is an '' old us system '' that is divided into standard and steel needles , the latter being fine lace needles
