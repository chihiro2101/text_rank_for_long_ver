the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river more recent canals now also make the navigation a vital link in the english and welsh connected inland waterway network the traders of leeds were keen to have a navigable link to the town , to make easier the export of woollen cloth , but bills presented to parliament in 1621 and 1625 had failed as the 1600s drew to a close , a number of bills were passed for other rivers , and there was general support for river navigations although the bill had a lot of support , it was opposed by the city of york , who feared that the river ouse would be damaged by the scheme selby was the upper limit for seagoing ships at the time , and became a major transhipment port for the smaller boats using the canal in july 1821 , rennie proposed the construction of docks at goole , rather than a lock into the river , and the company proposed that of water should be available construction at goole started on 28 september 1822 , and the company eventually built much of the new town as well as the docks faced with yet another outside scheme which would bypass the navigation from wakefield to ferrybridge , the company looked at improvements which would give of water all the way to both leeds and wakefield it included a clause to ensure that the selby canal was maintained with a depth of water of , and made provision for extensions to goole docks work started on a new cut at castleford and on the line to leeds , but legal action over the selby canal meant that it had to be made deeper and wider in 1832 and 1833 the leeds line was completed in april 1835 , somewhat later than anticipated , as the banks were made more substantial , to cope with steam tugs , which would be introduced in due course improvements to the calder to wakefield took longer , as there were problems with floods filling the workings , difficulty with constructing foundations for an aqueduct which would carry the navigation over the river calder at stanley ferry , and then in transporting the castings for the aqueduct to the site the aire and calder tried to work with the railways when they arrived in the 1840s , by making traffic agreements , but still suffered a significant drop in trade warde-aldam thought that such a system could carry 45,000 tons of coal per year , and Â£13,382 was allocated for three train boats , a hoist , and hydraulic machinery to control the hoist and the lock into the docks after the first world war , another programme of improvements to the locks was carried out , extending the locks to , which enabled trains of 19 compartments to operate regularly the compartments continued until the late 1960s to carry around half a million tons of coal , long after most british canals had ceased to be used for commercial traffic , but the gradual demise of the coal industry led to compartment traffic ceasing in 1986 it was funded by the aire and calder , with the don navigation eventually meeting half the cost locks on the wakefield section can accommodate vessels which are with a draught of , though rigid vessels are constrained to 141 & nbsp ; ft to enable turning at wakefield while the locks below castleford have three sets of gates , so that a section can be used , rather than the full required by the compartment boats the complete structure was then pushed into position by hydraulic jacks in a six-day operation , after which the navigation was diverted over it , although the old aqueduct was left in place and can still be used the failure resulted in some of material , including the banks of the river and the canal , slipping into the workings , which then flooded to a depth of , creating a lake which covered the concept failed after 18 months , as the dock workers at hull blacklisted the entire british waterways fleet , because they believed that the system would threaten their jobs the aire and calder was built for commercial freight , and although the volume carried has dropped significantly , particularly since coal deliveries to ferrybridge power station by canal stopped , the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007 , down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000 the leeds to castleford section and much of the wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes , but below castleford , the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious , and pleasure boats must give way to commercial vessels much of the ex-industrial ( western ) part of the navigation now has the appearance of a tree-lined , gently-twisting river the eastern part of the navigation , sometimes known as the knottingley and goole canal , is rather different : it has long straight stretches , but mainly through flat land that has always been agricultural with the possible restoration of the barnsley canal and the dearne and dove canal , the section between wakefield and the new junction canal might become part of a new '' yorkshire ring ''
