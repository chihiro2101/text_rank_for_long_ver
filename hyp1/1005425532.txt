the stepper motor is known for its property of converting a train of input pulses ( typically square waves ) into a precisely defined increment in the shaft ’ s rotational position to make the motor shaft turn , first , one electromagnet is given power , which magnetically attracts the gear 's teeth variable reluctance ( vr ) motors have a plain iron rotor and operate based on the principle that minimum reluctance occurs with minimum gap , hence the rotor points are attracted toward the stator magnets a microcontroller or stepper motor controller can be used to activate the drive transistors in the right order , and this ease of operation makes unipolar motors popular with hobbyists ; they are probably the cheapest way to get precise angular movements the current in a winding needs to be reversed in order to reverse a magnetic pole , so the driving circuit must be more complicated , typically with an h-bridge arrangement ( however there are several off-the-shelf driver chips available to make this a simple affair ) a unipolar motor has twice the amount of wire in the same space , but only half used at any point in time , hence is 50 % efficient ( or approximately 70 % of the torque output available ) this requires higher current but can perform better as the winding inductance is reduced this method will run the motor on only half the available windings , which will reduce the available low speed torque but require less current to overcome the inductance and switch the windings quickly , one must increase the drive voltage l/r driver circuits are also referred to as voltage source drives because a constant positive or negative voltage is applied to each winding to set the step positions thus when controlled by a constant voltage drive , the maximum speed of a stepper motor is limited by its inductance since at some speed , the voltage u will be changing faster than the current i can keep up with an l/r drive it is possible to control a low voltage resistive motor with a higher voltage drive simply by adding an external resistor in series with each winding chopper drive circuits are referred to as controlled current drives because they generate a controlled current in each winding rather than applying a constant voltage chopper drive circuits are most often used with two-winding bipolar motors , the two windings being driven independently to provide a specific motor torque cw or ccw this current level is monitored by the controller by measuring the voltage across a small sense resistor in series with the winding this requires additional electronics to sense winding currents , and control the switching , but it allows stepper motors to be driven with higher torque at higher speeds than l/r drives it also allows the controller to output predetermined current levels rather than fixed various drive techniques have been developed to better approximate a sinusoidal drive waveform : these are half stepping and microstepping it has the same number of steps as the full-step drive , but the motor will have significantly less torque than rated two phases are always on so the motor will provide its maximum rated torque wave drive and single phase full step are both one and the same , with same number of steps but difference in torque the motor also has less torque ( approx 70 % ) at the full-step position ( where only a single phase is on ) zaber.com , microstepping regardless of the waveform used , as the microsteps become smaller , motor operation becomes more smooth , thereby greatly reducing resonance in any parts the motor may be connected to , as well as the motor itself some stepper controller ics use increased current to minimise such missed steps , especially when the peak current pulses in one phase would otherwise be very brief a step motor can be viewed as a synchronous ac motor with the number of poles ( on both rotor and stator ) increased , taking care that they have no common denominator to achieve full rated torque , the coils in a stepper motor must reach their full rated current during each step winding inductance and counter-emf generated by a moving rotor tend to resist changes in drive current , so that as the motor speeds up , less and less time is spent at full current—thus reducing motor torque this measurement is taken across a wide range of speeds and the results are used to generate the stepper motor 's dynamic performance curve as noted below this curve is affected by drive voltage , drive current and current switching techniques synchronous electric motors using permanent magnets have a resonant position holding torque ( called cogging torque , and sometimes included in the specifications ) when not driven electrically stepper motors ' nameplates typically give only the winding current and occasionally the voltage and winding resistance these figures can be helpful for more in-depth electronics design , when deviating from standard supply voltages , adapting third party driver electronics , or gaining insight when choosing between motor models with otherwise similar size , voltage , and torque specifications steppers should be sized according to published torque curve , which is specified by the manufacturer at particular drive voltages or using their own drive circuitry a stepper motor system consists of three basic elements , often combined with some type of user interface ( host computer , plc or dumb terminal ) : ; indexers : the indexer ( or controller ) is a microprocessor capable of generating step pulses and direction signals for the driver there are numerous types of drivers , with different voltage and current ratings and construction technology the main disadvantages in using a stepper motor is the resonance effect often exhibited at low speeds and decreasing torque with increasing speed advantages low cost for control achieved high torque at startup and low speeds ruggedness simplicity of construction can operate in an open loop control system low maintenance less likely to stall or slip will work in any environment can be used in robotics in a wide scale the motor has full torque at standstill ( if the windings are energized ) precise positioning and repeatability of movement since good stepper motors have an accuracy of 3–5 % of a step and this error is non-cumulative from one step to the next the motors response to digital input pulses provides open-loop control , making the motor simpler and less costly to control it is possible to achieve very low-speed synchronous rotation with a load that is directly coupled to the shaft
