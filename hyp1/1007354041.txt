identifiable types of roans include true or classic roan , varnish roan , and rabicano , though other currently unknown factors may be responsible for ambiguous '' roaning duns , which are solid-colored horses affected by the dun dilution gene on their bodies but with darker points , are also sometimes confused with roans , but they do not have the intermixed white and colored hairs of a roan horses with the classic or true roan pattern may be any base color which is intermingled with unpigmented white hairs on the body few combinations have the same unique terminology applied to the common roan colors , although palomino roans are sometimes called honey roans a varnish roan is not a true roan ; it is actually one of the leopard complex coat patterns associated with appaloosa , knabstrupper , noriker horse and related breeds rabicano is a white pattern that falls into the category of roaning or scattered white hairs , the genetics of which are not yet fully understood some forms of sabino , which is a pinto pattern , have roaning along the edges of other white spots or markings a roan horse may not fit into any of the traditional categories as there is much still to be learned about the genetics of roan most breed standards use the terms '' ticked '' and '' roan '' interchangeably , with the former referring to clearly defined flecks on a white background and the latter to flecks so closely spaced that the mixture appears even in breeds that are characterized by roaning and ticking such as the large munsterlander , clear white-marked individuals may be called plated belgian blues also typically exhibit spotting patterns , which are genetically separate from roan some '' cryptic '' roan cattle appear solid , but upon close inspection reveal a small roan patch mgf-controlled roan occurs when cattle possess one functional and one non-functional mgf gene ( heterozygous ) , resulting in a roughly even mixture of white regions and colored regions the allele that controls roaning in guinea pigs is incompletely dominant : an animal with one copy of the allele will have varying amounts of white hair scattered through its coat , particularly on the back and sides about 25 % of guinea pigs born to two roans are completely white , having two copies of the '' roan '' allele , and may have a constellation of deformities associated with '' lethal white syndrome '' , although this condition has no relation to overo lethal white syndrome in horses or double merle syndrome in dogs
