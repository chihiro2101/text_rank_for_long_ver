the samoyed is descended from the nenets herding laika , a dog that may not only be white , but also a wide variety of colors like many breeds , the samoyed was bred from a small number of founders ( in this case , from siberia ) in cold weather , samoyeds may sleep with their tails over their noses to provide additional warmth the undercoat typically sheds heavily once or twice a year , and this seasonal process is sometimes referred to as '' blowing coat '' while the breed may produce fewer allergens , care should be taken for severe allergies samoyeds are excellent companions , especially for small children or even other dogs , and they remain playful into old age the disease is known to be caused by an x-linked dominant faulty allele and therefore the disease is more severe in male samoyeds carrier females do develop mild symptoms after 2â€“3 months of age , but mostly do not go on to develop kidney failure affected males appear healthy for the first three months of life , but then symptoms start to appear and worsen as the disease progresses : the dog becomes lethargic and muscle wastage occurs , as a result of proteinuria clinically , proteinuria is found in both sexes from the age of three to four months ; in dogs older than this , kidney failure in combination with more or less pronounced hearing loss occurs swiftly and death at the age of 8 to 15 months is expected if a carrier female is mated with a healthy stud dog , the female offspring have a 50 % chance of being carriers for the disease , and any male offspring have a 50 % chance of being affected by the disease for the samoyeds several breed-specific hereditary diseases are described in the veterinary literature : diabetes in dogs similar but not identical to human type i ( insulin deficiency ) : the disease occurs in middle-aged samoyeds , the mean age at diagnosis is seven years before coming in heterozygous dogs ) ; the other symptoms are recessive , so they only come to expression in homozygous affected dogs
