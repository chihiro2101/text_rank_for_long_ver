because they attributed this conditioning of the medium to the growing population of cells itself , they referred to the phenomenon as autoinducer bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms for the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively , they must possess three characteristics : to secrete a signaling molecule , an autoinducer , to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules , and to regulate gene transcription as a response qs signaling molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria at low cell density , the molecules may just diffuse away at high cell density , the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level , and trigger changes in gene expression usually ahls do not need additional processing , and bind directly to transcription factors to regulate gene expression some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well moreover , a study showed that these host associated curvibacter bacteria produce a broad spectrum of ahl , explaining the presence of those operons even though their function in host-microbe interaction is largely unknown , curvibacter quorum-sensing signals are relevant for host-microbe interactions as a result , there is a different dna-binding motif affinity and thereby different target genes are activated therefore , bacteria have less chance to evade the immune system and to colonize host tissues coli ) , cell division may be partially regulated by ai-2-mediated quorum sensing however , they have a receptor that detects ahls from other bacteria and change their gene expression in accordance with the presence of other '' quorate '' populations of gram-negative bacteria therefore , salmonella appears to use sdia to detect the ahl production of other pathogens rather than the normal gut flora then they become aggressive , developing to the point at which their numbers are sufficient to overcome the host 's immune system , and form a biofilm , leading to disease within the host as the biofilm is a protective layer encasing the bacterial population another form of gene regulation that allows the bacteria to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling this important link between quorum sensing and anaerobiosis has a significant impact on the production of virulence factors of this organism in 2002 , the crystal structure of the receptor luxp of vibrio harveyi with its inducer ai-2 ( which is one of the few biomolecules containing boron ) bound to it was also determined a comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis of 138 genomes of bacteria , archaea , and eukaryotes found that '' the luxs enzyme required for ai-2 synthesis is widespread in bacteria , while the periplasmic binding protein luxp is present only in vibrio strains , '' leading to the conclusion that either '' other organisms may use components different from the ai-2 signal transduction system of vibrio strains to sense the signal of ai-2 or they do not have such a quorum sensing system at all certain bacteria can produce enzymes called lactonases that can target and inactivate ahls researchers have developed novel molecules which block the signalling receptors of bacteria ( '' quorum quenching '' ) mbtl is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount additionally , researchers are also examining the role of natural compounds ( such as caffeine ) as potential quorum sensing inhibitors although examples of horizontal gene transfer are apparent in luxi , luxr , and luxs phylogenies , they are relatively rare this result is in line with the observation that quorum sensing genes tend to control the expression of a wide array of genes scattered throughout the bacterial chromosome in addition , species that employ multiple discrete quorum sensing systems are almost all members of the gamma proteobacteria , and evidence of horizontal transfer of quorum sensing genes is most evident in this class next to the potential antimicrobial functionality , quorum-sensing derived molecules , especially the peptides , are being investigated for their use in other therapeutic domains as well , including immunology , central nervous system disorders and oncology quorum-sensing peptides have been demonstrated to interact with cancer cells , as well as to permeate the blood-brain barrier reaching the brain parenchyma these interactions are facilitated by quorum-sensing molecules and play a major role in maintaining the pathogenicity of bacteria towards other hosts , such as humans this mechanism can be understood by looking at the effects of n-acyl homoserine lactone ( ahl ) , one of the quorum sensing-signaling molecules in gram-negative bacteria , on plants the role of quorum-sensing molecules was better explained according to three categories : host physiologyâ€“based impact of quorum sensing molecules ; ecological effects ; and cellular signaling furanones have also been found to act on ahl-dependant transcriptional activity , whereby the half life of the autoinducer-binding luxr protein is significantly shortened indeed , the host modification results in a phenotypic switch of curvibacter , which modifies its ability to colonize the epithelial cell surfaces of h this technique has also been translated to agriculture , to restrict the spread of pathogenic bacteria that use quorum sensing in plants anti-biofouling is another process that exploits quorum quenching bacteria to mediate the dissociation of unwanted biofilms aggregating on wet surfaces , such as medical devices , transportation infrastructure and water systems several groups of social insects have been shown to use quorum sensing in a process that resembles collective decision-making the quorum sensing process in honey bees is similar to the method used by temnothorax ants in several ways examples include rewiring the ahl components to toxic genes to control population size in bacteria ; and constructing an auxin-based system to control population density in mammalian cells
