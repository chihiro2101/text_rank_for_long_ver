in 1984 , the observer used the term to refer to the type of people who wore it and subsequently , in the united kingdom , it is sometimes used as a mildly anorak ( slang ) left the original snorkel parka ( usaf n-3b parka , which is 3/4 length and has a full , attached hood ; the similar n-2b parka is waist-length and has an attached split hood ) was developed in the united states during the early 1950s for military use , mainly for flight crews stationed in extremely cold areas it gained the common name of '' snorkel parka '' because the hood can be zipped right up leaving only a small tunnel ( or snorkel ) for the wearer to look out of while still manufacturing parkas to the military standard , alpha industries have more recently adopted the orange lining and a slimmer fit when producing their vf59 model parka which is now more popular than the military version in the late 1980s the snorkel parka came to be associated in the uk with trainspotters , who would supposedly wear them , giving birth to the slang term there anorak following the end of the second world war the us army recognized the need for a new cold weather combat system , resulting in four main styles of fishtail parka : the ex-48 , m-48 , m-51 and the m-65 the name fishtail comes from the fish tail extension at the back that could be folded up between the legs , much like a knochensack , and fixed using snap connectors to add wind-proofing the ex-48 parka is distinctive as it has a left sleeve pocket and is made of thin poplin , only the later production m-48 parkas are made of the heavier sateen canvas type cotton the idea behind this 3 part system was to enable a more customisable parka that allowed for easier cleaning of the shell as the hood fur was on the detachable hood liner , not fixed to the shell as in the m-48 the later liners were also revised from the '' heavy when wet '' wool pile to a lighter woolen loop or frieze wool design that dried easier and were far lighter as a result , only hoods for these parkas made in 1972 and for one year later have real fur designed primarily for combat arms forces such as infantry , they are to be worn over other layers of clothing ; alone , the fishtail parka is insufficient to protect against '' dry cold '' conditions ( i.e it may have a full-zippered front opening , or pull over the head like an original anorak and close with snaps or a short zipper , has an integral hood , and elasticated or drawstring cuffs in some versions , when rolled up , the hood doubles as a bag into which the rest of the coat is pushed
