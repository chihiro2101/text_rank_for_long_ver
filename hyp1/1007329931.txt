two principal types of order in council exist : orders in council whereby the queen-in-council exercises the royal prerogative , and orders in council made in accordance with an act of parliament in new zealand , the orders in council , undertaken by the executive council , are required to give effect to the government 's decisions an order in council made under the royal prerogative is primary legislation and does not depend on any statute for its authority , although an act of parliament may change this minister for the civil service 1985 374 at 399 , per lord fraser of tullybelton this type has become less common with the passage of time , as statutes encroach on areas that used to form part of the royal prerogative historical use : see orders in council ( 1807 ) most orders of this sort are eventually formalized according to the traditional lawmaking process , if they are not revoked at the end of the emergency however , in the uk , this power was later superseded by a statutory power to make such orders in council under the civil contingencies act british orders in council may occasionally be used to effectively reverse court decisions applicable to british overseas territories without involving parliament this was reversed in the 1985 case council of civil service unions v minister for the civil service , which however allowed for some exceptions , such as national security that said , the use of orders in council has been extended recently , as the scotland act 1998 provides that draft orders in council may be laid before the scottish parliament in certain circumstances in the same way as they would have been laid before the westminster parliament an order in council of this type usually has the following form : '' her majesty , in pursuance of relevant section of primary legislation , is pleased , by and with the advice of her privy council , to order , and it is hereby ordered , as follows : '' for most of the period from 1972 to 2007 , much northern ireland legislation was made by order-in-council as part of direct rule under the government of wales act 2006 , the royal assent to measures of the national assembly for wales was given by order-in-council , but this is not done by statutory instrument but in a form similar to that of a prerogative order initially , the high court in 2006 held that these orders in council were unlawful : '' the suggestion that a minister can , through the means of an order in council , exile a whole population from a british overseas territory and claim that he is doing so for the 'peace , order and good government ' of the territory is to us repugnant
