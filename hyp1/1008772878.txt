from 1942–1964 , the bracero program allowed men with farming experience to work on us farms on a seasonal basis , and its end ushered in a new era for the development of mexico factory jobs began to leave central mexico , and workers followed the jobs from central mexico to the maquilas in the north and on the border during the five years before nafta , maquila employment had grown at a rate of 47 % ; this figure increased to 86 % in the next five years us tariffs were already low , and mexican duties were already not charged to maquiladoras the biggest threat came from china 's special economic areas since globalization and physical restructuring have contributed to the competition and advent of low-cost offshore assembly in places such as china , and countries in central america , maquiladoras in mexico have been on the decline since 2000 according to federal sources , approximately 529 maquiladoras shut down and investment in assembly plants decreased by 8.2 percent in 2002 after the imposition of countervailing duties on chinese products , not available in north america , that were part of the electronics supply chain despite the decline , over 3,000 maquiladoras still exist along the 2,000 mile-long united states & ndash ; mexico border , providing employment for approximately one million workers , and importing more than 51 billion in supplies into mexico research indicates that maquiladoras ' post-nafta growth is connected to changes in mexican wages relative to those in asia and in the united states , and to fluctuations in u.s federal reserve bank of dallas , did nafta really cause mexico 's high maquiladora growth ? , july 2001 as of 2006 , maquiladoras still accounted for 45 percent of mexico 's exports the border economy : nafta and maquiladoras : is the growth connected ? maquiladoras , in general , are best represented among operations that are particularly assembly intensive women entered the labor force in mexico in large numbers in the latter half of the 20th century between 1970 and 1995 , 18 % more women were part of the working force , and many of these women were working in maquila factories however , young single women often ended up in factories with better working conditions , like the electronics plants , while older women and mothers worked in more dangerous apparel factories the minimum wage set by the mexican government is barely enough to help sustain a family even with both parents working maquilas pay at much higher rate than the minimum wage in most markets since there is a lot of competition for the best workers , and workers will not work without transportation and other bonuses even in maquila factories , wages are still very low and in many families the children are encouraged to start working at an early age to support the family the humans rights watch wrote a report in 1996 about the failures of the government to address this issue despite the fact that pregnancy testing violates mexican federal labor law many contracts are only for a few months , allowing companies to have a high turn-over rate in which workers never have the chance to organize for their rights in 1993 , the mexican labor federation , the authentic labor front , and the united electrical workers worked together to improve conditions at the general electric factory , but failed in the loss of an election the center for labor studies ( cetlac ) was opened in the mid 1990s and worked to educate workers about their rights and activism decreased in light of violence against women a new wave of worker protests has emerged in the 21st century as workers decide that enough is enough the struggle put the nafta labor side agreement to the test , but despite the workers ' efforts , nothing ever came of it however , despite various us nao hearings and transnational labor rights organizing , the workers were never able to unionize both the united states and mexican governments claim to be committed to environmental protection , yet environmental policies have not always been enforced despite the fact that⁠ ⁠ maquilas are required to be certified and to provide an environmental impact statement the la paz agreement signed by mexico and the united states in 1983 requires hazardous waste created by united states corporations to be transported back to the united states for disposal however , the united states environmental protection agency ( epa ) reports that only 91 of the 600 maquiladoras located along the texas–mexico border have returned hazardous waste to the united states since 1987 this push to improve environmental policy was led by the mexican government , not the international companies themselves the epa 's us & ndash ; mexico border 2012 program has an extensive plan to help with environmental issues along that border
