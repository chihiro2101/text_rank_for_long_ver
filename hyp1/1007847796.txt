active learning occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience since understanding information is the key aspect of learning , it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not studies within metacognition have proven the value in active learning , claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result 15–20 in addition , learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn active learning is a key characteristic of student-centered learning associative learning is the process by which a person or animal learns an association between two stimuli or events it is a form of social learning which takes various forms , based on various processes in humans , this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur , but instead , requires a social model such as a parent , sibling , friend , or teacher with surroundings imprinting is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior play generally describes behavior with no particular end in itself , but that improves performance in similar future situations it also consumes energy , so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved play is generally seen in younger animals , suggesting a link with learning however , it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning , for example improving physical fitness play , as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child 's learning and development as a form of learning , play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children there are five types of play : sensorimotor play aka functional play , characterized by the repetition of an activity roleplay occurs starting at the age of 3 rule-based play where authoritative prescribed codes of conduct are primary construction play involves experimentation and building movement play aka physical play these five types of play are often intersecting all types of play generate thinking and problem-solving skills in children specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan enculturation is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture moore ( 1989 ) purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality , effective online learning : learner–learner ( i.e the major technique used for rote learning is learning by repetition , based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly ( but not its meaning ) if the information is repeatedly processed to this end , meaningful learning contrasts with rote learning in which information is acquired without regard to understanding evidence-based learning is the use of evidence from well designed scientific studies to accelerate learning the term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning , but rather the way it is directed and organized the educational system may use a combination of formal , informal , and nonformal learning methods tangential learning is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy according to experts in natural learning , self-oriented learning training has proven an effective tool for assisting independent learners with the natural phases of learning points out that intrinsic integration of learning content seems to be a crucial design factor , and that games that include modules for further self-studies tend to present good results in incidental teaching learning is not planned by the instructor or the student , it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience , observation , self-reflection , interaction , unique event , or common routine task here are some steps most commonly used in incidental teaching : an instructor will arrange the learning environment so that necessary materials are within the student 's sight , but not within his reach , thus impacting his motivation to seek out those materials this type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses for example , in learning to play chess , the person must learn the rules ( cognitive domain ) —but must also learn how to set up the chess pieces and how to properly hold and move a chess piece ( psychomotor ) furthermore , later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself , value its applications in life , and appreciate its history ( affective domain ) transfer of learning is the application of skill , knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent ; most common when '' first , it is speculated that different types of transfer exist , including : near transfer , the application of skill to solve a novel problem in a similar context ; and far transfer , the application of skill to solve a novel problem presented in a different context furthermore , perkins and salomon ( 1992 ) suggest that positive transfer in cases when learning supports novel problem solving , and negative transfer occurs when prior learning inhibits performance on highly correlated tasks , such as second or third-language learning habits or mental acts developed by a particular kind of training may inhibit rather than facilitate other mental activities '' a significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur early research by ruger , for example , found that the '' level of attention '' , '' attitudes '' , '' method of attack '' ( or method for tackling a problem ) , a '' search for new points of view '' , a '' careful testing of hypothesis '' and '' generalization '' were all valuable approaches for promoting transfer to encourage transfer through teaching , perkins and salomon recommend aligning ( '' hugging '' ) instruction with practice and assessment , and '' bridging '' , or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content heredity : a classroom instructor can neither change nor increase heredity , but the student can use and develop it status of students : physical and home conditions also matter : certain problems like malnutrition i.e physical environment : the design , quality , and setting of a learning space , such as a school or classroom , can each be critical to the success of a learning environment there are several internal factors that affect learning if effective learning should take place attention is essential this makes learning more effective it is a condition in which an individual 's ability to acquire certain skills , knowledge through training the attitude of the student must be tested to find out how much inclination he or she has for learning a subject or topic learning activities : learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher , his concept of discipline , methods of teaching , and above all his overall personality testing : various tests measure individual learner differences at the heart of effective learning guidance : everyone needs guidance in some part or some time in life guidance covers the whole gamut of learners problems- learning as well as non-learning animals gain knowledge in two ways in a changing environment , an animal must constantly gain new information to survive however , in a stable environment , this same individual needs to gather the information it needs once , and then rely on it for the rest of its life therefore , different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge essentially , the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation , or whether it innately knew the information however , if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it , then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information if an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs , then learning is simply unnecessary because there is no need for learning in this scenario—and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information—non-learning evolves in fact , a study of drosophila melanogaster showed that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity , possibly because egg-laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the newly learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning however , in environments where change occurs within an animal 's lifetime but is not constant , learning is more likely to evolve learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can adapt to the new situation , but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time the concepts of learning and memory are relevant in identifying how plants respond to external cues , a behavior necessary for survival the percentage difference in population behavior observed between the control and experimental groups is meant to distinguish innate phototropism behavior from active associative learning similarly , michael pollan , an author , and journalist , says in his piece the intelligent plant that researchers do not doubt gagliano 's data but rather her language , specifically her use of the term “ learning ” and '' cognition '' with respect to plants a direction for future research is testing whether circadian rhythms in plants modulate learning and behavior and surveying researchers ' definitions of “ cognition ” and “ learning
