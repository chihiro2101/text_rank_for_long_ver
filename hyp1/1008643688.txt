in the early 1980s , most home computers manufactured in japan such as the nec pc-6001 and pc-8000 series , fujitsu 's fm-7 and fm-8 , and hitachi 's basic master featured a variant of the microsoft basic interpreter integrated into their on-board roms however , we must purchase not only personal computers but also home appliances from nec nishi proposed msx as an attempt to create a single industry standard for home computers inspired by the success of vhs as a standard for video cassette recorders , many japanese electronic manufacturers along with goldstar , philips and spectravideo built and promoted msx computers in particular , the expansion cartridge form and function were part of the standard ; any msx expansion or game cartridge would work in any msx computer this was a choice of components that was shared by many other home computers and games consoles of the period , such as the colecovision and sega sg-1000 video game systems consequently , these components alongside microsoft 's msx basic made the msx a competitive , though somewhat expensive , home computer package spectravideo 's msx enjoyed very little success , and yamaha 's cx5m model , built to interface with various types of midi equipment , was billed more as a digital music tool than a standard personal computer & nbsp ; 90 ) in its place , the msx turbor was released , which used the new custom 16-bit r800 microprocessor developed by ascii corporation intended for the msx3 , but features such as dma and 24-bit addressing were disabled however , the msx did not become the worldwide standard envisioned because of limited adoption in other markets before the msx 's lack of success in these markets became apparent , us manufacturer commodore business machines overhauled its product line in the early 1980s and introduced models such as the plus/4 and commodore 16 that were intended to better compete with the features of msx computers the system msx most closely resembled was the spectravideo sv-328 home computer ( spectravideo even claimed to be '' msx compatible '' in advertisements before the actual launch of msx systems , but it was in fact not completely compatible with it ) in 2011 age labs introduced language pack firmware , aiming to make each model support several localizations woomb.net was the english counterpart of this and other japanese services offered by d4 enterprise , which also announced in august 2006 the launch of a new msx2 compatible system called the '' 1chipmsx '' , a system based on an altera cyclone ep1c12q240c8 fpga the new msx system is housed in a box made out of transparent blue plastic , and can be used with a standard monitor ( or tv ) and a pc keyboard at that time , the website of the msx licensing corporation that they linked to as source , had a text saying 'we are planning to revitalize msx , the innovative computer platform however , the website was later changed to contain only the logo of itny & partners , and a link to itny & partners english and japanese websites and has no mention of the msx licensing corporation at all on , bazix reported on their website 's front page that they are no longer the representative of msx association , due to being unable to achieve their goals of '' bringing about the commercial msx revival beyond the japanese borders '' and '' the transfer of the msx trademark from msx association to msx licensing corporation '' and '' no outlook on any progress in the western one chip msx project any time soon '' according to their post , they will cooperate with d4 enterprise and the msx licensing corporation '' in one or more retro gaming related projects '' the article mentions as well the ese msx system 3 , on which the 1chipmsx ( also known as one chip msx or ocm ) is based in 2011 , age labs announced the launch of a msx kit called gr8bit - the do-it-yourself computer for learning purposes , which was licensed by the msx licensing corporation some of the korean forum members who made zemmix neo created a new version of msx called mini iq3000 cutie , which has similar features to the iq-2000 ( msx2 daewoo electronics ) it is based on 1chipmsx but has some special features like 'scan line generator ' and 'multi language support ' normally it shows korean font and working as korean version of msx but when pressing the 'del ' key while booting , it changes to japanese mode like the latest zemmix game consoles , it is also based on a raspberry pi card with additional circuitry to connect the original msx peripherals
