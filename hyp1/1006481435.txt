data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company designed to be rack-mounted similarly to the later pdp-8 machines , it was packaged on four pcb cards and was thus smaller in height , while also including a number of features that made it run considerably faster announced as '' the best small computer in the world '' , the nova quickly gained a following , especially in scientific and educational markets , and made the company flush with cash based on many of the same concepts as the nova , it included support for virtual memory and multitasking more suitable to the small office environment while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' data general immediately launched their own 32-bit effort in 1976 to build what they called the '' world 's best 32-bit machine '' , known internally as the '' fountainhead project '' , or fhp for short ( fountain head project ) when digital 's vax-11/780 was shipped in february 1978 , however , fountainhead was not yet ready to deliver a machine , due mainly to problems in project management in the meantime , customers were abandoning data general in droves , driven not only by the delivery problems with the original eclipse , including very serious quality control and customer service problems , but also the power and versatility of digital 's new vax line one of data general 's significant customers at this time was the united states forest service , which starting in the mid-1980s used dg systems installed at all levels from headquarters in washington , d.c the dg easy product , a portable application platform developed by nichols and others from 1975 to 1979 but never marketed , had roots easily traceable back to the rpg vm created by stephen schleimer also notable were several commercial software products developed in the mid to late 1970s in conjunction with the commercial computers the first product was idea ( interactive data entry/access ) , which consisted of a screen design tool ( ifmt ) , tp controller ( imon ) , and a program development language ( ifpl ) both of these products were a major departure from the transaction monitors of the day which did not have a screen design tool and used subroutine calls from cobol to handle the screen eventually , idea ran on every commercial hardware product from the micronova ( 4 users ) to the mv series under aos/vs , the same idea program running all those systems the cs40 ( the first of this line ) was a package system which supported four terminal users , each running a different cobol program these products also led to the development of a third product , tpms ( transaction processing monitoring system ( announced in 1980 ) ) which could capably run a large number of cobol or pl/i users with a smaller number of processors , a major resource and performance advantage on aos and aos/vs systems data general software packages supporting xodiac included comprehensive electronic office ( ceo ) data general produced a full range of peripherals , sometimes by rebadging printers for example , but data general 's own series of crt-based and hard-copy terminals were high quality and featured a generous number of function keys , each with the ability to send different codes , with any combination of control and shift keys , which influenced wordperfect design most data general software was written specifically for their own terminals ( or the terminal emulation built into the desktop generation dg10 , but the data general one built-in terminal emulator is not often suitable ) , although software using data general business basic could be more flexible in terminal handling , because logging into a business basic system would initiate a process whereby the terminal type would ( usually ) be auto-detected data general 's introduction of the data general-one ( dg-1 ) in 1984 is one of the few cases of a minicomputer company introducing a truly breakthrough pc product data general also brought out a small-footprint '' desktop generation '' range , starting with the dg10 that included both data general and intel cpus in a patented closely coupled arrangement , able to run ms-dos or cp/m-86 concurrently with dg/rdos , with each benefiting from the hardware acceleration given by other cpu as a co-processor that would handle ( for instance ) screen graphics or disk operations concurrently despite having some good features and having less direct competition from the flood of cheap pc compatibles , the desktop generation range also struggled , partly because they offered an economical way of running what was essentially '' legacy software '' while the future was clearly either slightly cheaper personal computers or slightly more expensive '' super minicomputers '' such as the mv and vax computers for instance , ibm often delivered machines whose only purpose was to generate accounting data for a single company , running software tailored for that company alone now developers typically linked together several pieces of existing software , as opposed to developing everything from scratch in this market , the question of which machine was the '' best '' changed ; it was no longer the machine with the best priceâ€“performance ratio or service contracts , but the one that ran all of the third-party software the customer intended to use formerly , almost all computer companies attempted to make their machines different enough that when their customers sought a more powerful machine , it was often cheaper to buy another from the same company with the change in software development , combined with new generations of commodity processors that could match the performance of low-end minicomputers , lock-in was no longer working in 1988 , two company directors put together a report showing that if the company were to continue existing in the future , dg would have to either invest heavily in software to compete with new applications being delivered by ibm and dec on their machines , or alternately exit the proprietary hardware business entirely they also outlined a different solution : instead of trying to compete against the much larger ibm and dec , they suggested that since the user no longer cared about the hardware as much as software , dg could deliver the best '' commodity '' machines instead '' now the customer could run any software they wished as long as it ran on unix , and by the early 1990s , everything did at the time aviion came to market , commodity hard disk drives could not offer the sort of performance needed for data center use dg quickly responded by introduced new models of the aviion series based on a true commodity processor , the intel x86 series by this time a number of other vendors , notably sequent computer systems , were also introducing similar machines dg did begin a minor shift toward the service industry , training their technicians for the role of implementing a spate of new x86-based servers and the new microsoft windows nt domain-driven , small server world data general also targeted the explosion of the internet in the latter 1990s with the formation of the thiin line business unit , led by tom west , which had a focus on creation and sale of so-called '' internet appliances '' clariion was the only product line that saw continued success through the later 1990s after finding a large niche for unix storage systems , and its sales were still strong enough to make dg a takeover target although details of the acquisition specified that emc had to take the entire company , and not just the storage line , emc quickly ended all development and production of dg computer hardware and parts , effectively ending data general 's presence in the segment the maintenance business was sold to a third party , who also acquired all of dg 's remaining hardware components for spare parts sales to old dg customers data general would be only one of many new england based computer companies , including the original digital equipment corporation , that collapsed or were sold to larger companies after the 1980s on the internet , even the old data general domain ( dg.com ) , which contained a few emc webpages that only mentioned the latter company in passing , was sold to the dollar general discount department store chain in october 2009
