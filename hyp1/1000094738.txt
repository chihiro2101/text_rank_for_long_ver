the game reached its greatest popularity during the han dynasty , as is evidenced by the discovery of many examples of liubo boards or sets of liubo game pieces as grave goods in high status tombs dating to the han dynasty engraved picture stones ( 畫像石 ) and moulded picture bricks ( 畫像磚 ) that were widely used to decorate tombs and temples during the eastern han period ( 25–220 ce ) also frequently depict people playing liubo , sometimes as a small part of a complex scene depicting many different activities , but sometimes as the focal point of the scene , with the players attended by servants and playing in the cool of a pavilion although the game is still occasionally referred to in some historical sources and in poetry as late as the tang dynasty ( 618–907 ) , it seems that liubo had been largely displaced by the go ( game ) by the time of the yuan dynasty ( 1271–1368 ) all knowledge of the game of liubo had been lost , and it is only with the archeological discoveries of recent years that the game has become better known the old book of tang mentions that tibetans enjoyed playing both the game of go and liubo , but although ancient tibetan go boards have been discovered , no examples of tibetan liubo boards are known however , to date no examples of liubo boards have been found outside of china in many tombs only the liubo board has survived ( especially if made of stone or bronze ) , and it can be assumed that any associated game pieces have decayed , whereas in other cases the game pieces ( which are often made of ivory ) have survived but the liubo board ( which is often made of wood or lacquer ) has rotted away long ) 象削一 1 eighteen-sided die with the numbers '' 1 '' through '' 16 '' and characters meaning '' win '' and '' lose '' not listed in the inventory the six black and six white game pieces are the main game pieces to be moved around the board , and similar sets of cubic or cuboid game pieces made from ivory , jadeite or rock crystal have been found in several other tombs in at least one case the game pieces are not distinguished by colour , but by having an engraving of a tiger on the pieces of one set and an engraving of a dragon on the pieces of the other set however , the twenty ivory game pieces and the eighteen-sided die in the mawangdui set are not typically associated with liubo boards in other tombs , and it is possible that they were not used for playing liubo , but were equipment for a different game a similar eighteen-sided die with numbers '' 1 '' through '' 16 '' , '' win '' and '' take a drink '' was found in association with two sets of twenty copper , coin-shaped tokens ( one set inscribed '' number 1 '' through '' number 20 '' , and the other set inscribed with three-character lines of poetry ) in a han tomb at mancheng county in hebei no liubo board or liubo game pieces were found in the tomb , and because of the inscription '' take a drink '' ( 酒來 ) on one face of the die , the die and sets of tokens are supposed to have been used for a drinking game thumb the exact rules of the game of liubo are not known , and some of the surviving descriptions of the game are conflicting , which suggests that the game may have been played according to different rules at different times or in different places the most complete description of the rules of liubo occurs in a quotation from the lost book of ancient bo ( 古博經 ) in a commentary by zhang zhan ( 張湛 ) to the liezi that was written during the jin dynasty ( 265–420 ) : method of play : two people sit facing each other over a board , and the board is divided into twelve paths , with two ends , and an area called the '' water '' in the middle twelve game pieces are used , which according to the ancient rules are six white and six black when a piece has been moved to a certain place it is stood up on end , and called an '' owl ( 梟or驍 ) '' another , somewhat later source , the family instructions of master yan by yan zhitui ( 531–591 ) states that there were two variants of liubo , '' greater bo '' ( 大博 ) which was played with six throwing sticks , and '' lesser bo '' ( 小博 ) which was played with two dice : the ancient greater bo used six sticks , whereas lesser bo used two dice certain throws would allow a player 's piece to move into the center and ‘ kill ’ the opponent ’ s piece if it was already there the prognostications under the liubo diagram are headed with one of nine terms that correspond to the words of an enigmatic , mnemonic rhyme about liubo written by xu bochang ( 許博昌 ) during the reign of emperor wu of han ( 141–87 bce ) ; lillian tseng ( zeng lanying ) argues that these are the names for particular points on the board ( the two lines of the '' v '' mark , the two lines of the '' l '' mark , the two lines of the '' t '' mark , the circle or line between the corner and the central square , the outside edge of the central square , and the inside of the central square ) it has been theorized that the placement of the sixty sexagenary terms on the points of the liubo divination diagram indicate the possible positions for placing pieces when playing liubo , and that the sequence of the terms across the divination diagram reflects the path to be followed around the board when playing the game ( starting at the north-east corner and ending at the north side of the central square )
