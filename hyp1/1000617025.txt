veneration towards those who were considered holy began in early christianity , with the martyrs first being given special honor over time , the honor also began to be given to those christians who lived lives of holiness and sanctity in catholic and orthodox theology , veneration is a type of honor distinct from the latria , which is due to god alone although we see in english a broader usage of the word “ adoration ” which may not refer to a form of worship exclusive to god—for example , when a husband says that he “ adores his wife ” —in general it can be maintained that adoration is the best english denotation for the worship of latria historically , schools of theology have used the term “ worship ” as a general term which included both adoration and veneration ” the word “ worship ” ( in a similar way to how the liturgical term “ cult ” is traditionally used ) was not synonymous with adoration , but could be used to introduce either adoration or veneration hence catholic sources will sometimes use the term “ worship ” not to indicate adoration , but only the worship of veneration given to mary and the saints church theologians have long adopted the terms latria for the type of worship due to god alone , and dulia and proskynesis for the veneration given to angels , saints , relics and icons images , veneration of , catholic and orthodox theologies also include the term hyperdulia for the type of veneration specifically paid to mary , mother of jesus , in catholic and orthodox traditions the special graces accorded by god to mary motivated her title of mediatrix of all graces to the humanity , her intercessory ability to jesus christ god about the believers ' intentions of prayer , and lastly the special veneration that the catholic , eastern orthodox and oriental orthodox churches - sharing the same dogmas - attribute to her , in comparison with all other saints protestant theology usually denies that any real distinction between veneration and worship can be made , and claims that the practice of veneration distracts the christian soul from its true object , the worship of god in his institutes of the christian religion , john calvin writes that '' ( t ) he distinction of what is called dulia and latria was invented for the very purpose of permitting divine honours to be paid to angels and dead men with apparent impunity '' islam has had a rich history of veneration of saints ( often called wali , which literally means '' friend of god '' ) , see john renard , friends of god : islamic images of piety , commitment , and servanthood ( berkeley : university of california press , 2008 ) ; idem in sunni islam , the veneration of saints became a very common form of religious celebration early on , and saints came to be defined in the eighth-century as a group of '' special people chosen by god and endowed with exceptional gifts , such as the ability to work miracles the classical sunni scholars came to recognize and honor these individuals as venerable people who were both '' loved by god and developed a close relationship of love to him john renard , friends of god : islamic images of piety , commitment , and servanthood ( berkeley : university of california press , 2008 ) veneration of saints eventually became one of the most widespread sunni practices for more than a millennium , before it was opposed in the twentieth century by the salafi movement , whose various streams regard it as '' being both un-islamic and backwards
