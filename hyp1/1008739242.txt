it also describes any theological position , moral principle , spiritual practice , or lifestyle thought to be inconsistent with the catholic rule of faith in general , this term is used in two distinct senses : to label a theological system or viewpoint which , although erroneous and unacceptable to hold or promote within orthodoxy , has not been formally defined as heresy many protestants , such as lutherans , use the term '' heterodox '' to describe christian teachings which are not in agreement with their understanding of scripture the arabic word is used by shia muslims for beliefs perceived as being extremely heterodox ( more in line with the christian use of the word '' heresy '' ) in particular , the term is used to describe the beliefs of minority muslim groups who ascribe divine characteristics to a member of muhammad 's family ( especially ali ) or the early sahabah such as salman the persian the assumption is that the groups thus described have gone too far and have come to associate them with god several ultra-orthodox groups such as the wahhabis , in turn , see themselves as the only truly orthodox groups within islam historical groups viewed as highly heterodox by most muslims include the kharijites , who took a third view on ali 's succession ( and are today succeeded by the ibadi ) , the mu'tazilites , who most famously asserted that the qur'an was created , a view which enjoyed caliphal approval before the time of mutawakkil , the qarmatians , a branch of the seveners within ismaili islam who took control of much of the arabian peninsula in the 9th and 10th century , practiced vegetarianism , attacked hajj pilgrims and took control of the well of zamzam and the black stone before their decline , and the hashashin or assassins , another ismaili group , famous for their reclusive lifestyle , manners of indoctrination and assassinations in the years after the first crusade the view that ali was divine , though never mainstream within shiism , is attested in the early centuries of islam bábism ( most followers of which came to follow baha ' u'llah and became the baháʼí faith and were further divided into many sects ) is viewed by many non-followers as originally having been a highly divergent movement within the twelver ismailism practiced in 19th century persia beyond heterodoxy , many elements of islam have been incorporated into distinct belief systems several times , most specifically into sikhism and the baháʼí faith , whose predecessor movement was bábism
