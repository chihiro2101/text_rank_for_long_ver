on 16 august 1832 , at one of the nottinghamshire miner 's regular meetings at the sun inn , at eastwood the idea was mooted to extend the mansfield and pinxton railway to leicester the decision was taken to involve outside finance , and , on 27 august 1832 , a public meeting to attract subscriptions was held at the george inn at alfreton and on 26 september 1832 the scheme was formally approved at eastwood , though at that time the possibility of using steam locomotives had not been discussed subscriptions had been obtained from lancashire investors and with the imminent completion of the london and birmingham railway , they insisted that the line should continue to join it at rugby , warwickshire in october an alternative plan was proposed of bringing in nottingham and derby , as well as leicester , using a junction at long eaton , with the stated aim that it would reduce any differences in coal prices between them the line to pinxton threatened it , particularly as , in 1834 , the midland counties had mooted the possibility of an extension to clay cross at the same time , the birmingham and derby link with the london and birmingham railway in a southwards direction at hampton-in-arden , threatened the midland counties secondly , the bill still included the pinxton line , to the extreme annoyance of the birmingham and derby line 's directors there was a distinct possibility that the lords would insist that the north midland was connected to it instead of proceeding to derby , losing the nmr some twenty miles of line and its connection to birmingham and the west country since this was the original reason for building the railway , one can imagine the feelings of the nottinghamshire miners by february 1837 , the engineers had marked out the whole of the line the principal contractors struggled to meet the deadline of 22 february to quote for the construction of 22 miles of railway , so the deadline was extended to 28 february , with the additional requirement of a cast-iron bridge over the river trent at thrumpton by september 1837 it was reported that 400 men were employed in three different places on the line between nottingham and derby the portion of the contract from leicester to the trent viaduct was let in december 1837 at which point it was reported that 900 men were engaged in the construction it had three main obstacles , the first being the crossing of the trent at leicester there was another magnificent station in campbell street , originally planned as a terminus on a spur from the main line it was replaced by the present london road station in 1892 the line was finally opened in three stages : derby to nottingham 4 june 1839 trent junction to leicester 4 may 1840 leicester to rugby 1 july 1840 on 4 june 1839 the company provided four trains at nottingham for passenger services on opening day initially the midland counties ' railway did not prosper due to competition from the birmingham and derby junction railway which also transported coal from the east midlands to london , via hampton-in-arden now known as the erewash valley line , it joined near where the three original lines met at trent junction , crossing to the up ( london ) line on the level at platt 's crossing most of the original midland counties ' railway line between nottingham , derby and leicester is still operating today as part of the midland main line the original line into derby , through what later became the site of chaddesden sidings , closed in 1969 also part of the original route was abandoned when track alterations were put in with the opening of trent station in the 1860s the line between trent junction and chesterfield , known locally as the erewash valley line , is still today the second most busy in the east midlands , with freight to the south east of the country although the old north midlands through derby is the main express line ( since trains have to reverse at nottingham ) , there is still a half-hourly service from nottingham itself to london
