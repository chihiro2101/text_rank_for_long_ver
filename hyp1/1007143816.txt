a upnp compatible device from any vendor can dynamically join a network , obtain an ip address , announce its name , advertise or convey its capabilities upon request , and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices no special device driver support is necessary ; common network protocols are used instead ; operating system and programming language independence : any operating system and any programming language can be used to build upnp products upnp stacks are available for most platforms and operating systems in both closed and open source forms in addition to combining services defined by upnp forum in various ways , vendors can define their own device and service types , and can extend standard devices and services with vendor-defined actions , state variables , data structure elements , and variable values it assumes the network must run internet protocol ( ip ) and then leverages http , soap and xml on top of ip , in order to provide device/service description , actions , data transfer and eventing if during the dhcp transaction , the device obtains a domain name , for example , through a dns server or via dns forwarding , the device should use that name in subsequent network operations ; otherwise , the device should use its ip address once a device has established an ip address , the next step in upnp networking is discovery when a device is added to the network , ssdp allows that device to advertise its services to control points on the network the upnp device description is expressed in xml and includes vendor-specific manufacturer information like the model name and number , serial number , manufacturer name , ( presentation ) urls to vendor-specific web sites , etc if a device has a url for presentation , then the control point can retrieve a page from this url , load the page into a web browser , and depending on the capabilities of the page , allow a user to control the device and/or view device status upnp av media servers provide a service to upnp av client devices , so-called control points , for browsing the media content of the server and request the media server to deliver a file to the control point for playback hardware-based upnp av media servers may run on any nas devices or any specific hardware for delivering media , such as a dvr this standard allows a upnp-capable home network device to provide its interface ( display and control options ) as a web page to display on any other device connected to the home network that means that one can control a home networking device through any web browser-based communications method for ce devices on a upnp home network using ethernet and a special version of html called ce-html qos ( quality of service ) - is an important ( but not mandatory ) service function for use with upnp av ( audio and video ) quality of service refers to control mechanisms that can provide different priority to different users or data flows , or guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow in accordance with requests from the application program quality of service for upnp consist of sink device ( client-side/front-end ) and source device ( server-side/back-end ) service functions many routers and firewalls expose themselves as internet gateway devices , allowing any local upnp control point to perform a variety of actions , including retrieving the external ip address of the device , enumerating existing port mappings , and adding or removing port mappings there also exists a non-standard solution called upnp-up ( universal plug and play - user profile ) which proposes an extension to allow user authentication and authorization mechanisms for upnp devices and applications many upnp device implementations lack authentication mechanisms , and by default assume local systems and their users are completely trustworthy this requires specific version of adobe flash with acknowledged security issues ) are capable of generating a specific type of http request which allows a router implementing the upnp igd protocol to be controlled by a malicious web site when someone with a upnp-enabled router simply visits that web site the tool was made public at defcon 19 and allows portmapping requests to external ip addresses from the device and internal ip addresses behind the nat upnp is often the only significant multicast application in use in digital home networks ; therefore , multicast network misconfiguration or other deficiencies can appear as upnp issues rather than underlying network issues the upnp internet gateway device ( igd ) standard has a wanipconnection service , which provides similar functionality to ietf-standard port control protocol comparison of upnp av media servers devices profile for web services digital living network alliance ( dlna ) list of upnp av media servers and clients port control protocol nat port mapping protocol ( nat-pmp ) internet gateway device protocol port ( computer networking ) zeroconf
