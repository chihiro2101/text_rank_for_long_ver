his company , founded on 17 june 1909 , became the first british public company to build aircraft in the immediate postwar years , handley page modified a number of o/400 's to passenger use , which they flew on the london-paris route as handley page transport the v/1500 was considered too large to be practical at the time , but a number of design features of the v/1500 were later incorporated into an o/400 airframe to produce their first dedicated passenger design , the w.8 that led to a series of similar airliners , fitted with two or three engines , which , aside from being used by handley page transport , were also exported to belgium handley page continued to develop large biplane airliners , including the luxurious handley page h.p.42 , for use on imperial routes to africa and india handley page '' developments in aircraft design by the use of slotted wings '' flight , 22 december 1921 , page 844 and page 845 the leading edge slat was simultaneously designed by the german aerodynamicist gustav lachmann , who was later employed by handley page in response to a 1936 government request for heavier , longer ranged aircraft , handley page tendered the hp.56 design powered by twin rolls-royce vultures and this was ordered , along with what became the avro manchester however the vulture proved so troublesome that – years before the engine was abandoned by rolls-royce in 1940 – the air staff decided that the hp.56 should be fitted with four engines instead although in some respects ( such as crew survivability ) better than the lancaster , the halifax suffered in terms of altitude performance buttler p129 and was redeployed toward the end of the war as a heavy transport and glider tug , with several variants being specifically built as such , including the hp.70 halton the three types produced were known as the v bombers , and handley page 's contribution was the hp.80 victor , a four-engined , crescent-winged design this aircraft remained in service ( as a tanker aircraft ) well beyond the demise of the company which created it unable to compete for government orders or build large commercial aircraft , handley page produced its final notable handley page design , the jetstream beginning with the model e , the letter was used in combination with a slash and a number that referred to the installed horsepower , at least initially when the assets of miles aircraft were taken over , the latter 's reading design office used hpr for handley page reading , followed by a number as with the hpr.1 marathon
