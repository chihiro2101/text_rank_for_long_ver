known as the '' father of english geology '' , smith recognized the significance of strata or rock layering and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata ; he created the first geologic map of england image : geology of cyprus-chalk.jpg thumb chalk layers in cyprus , showing sedimentary layering variation in rock units , most obviously displayed as visible layering , is due to physical contrasts in rock type ( lithology ) these variations provide a lithostratigraphy or lithologic stratigraphy of the rock unit the basic concept in stratigraphy , called the law of superposition , states : in an undeformed stratigraphic sequence , the oldest strata occur at the base of the sequence chemostratigraphy studies the changes in the relative proportions of trace elements and isotopes within and between lithologic units the geologic time scale was developed during the 19th century , based on the evidence of biologic stratigraphy and faunal succession this timescale remained a relative scale until the development of radiometric dating , which was based on an absolute time framework , leading to the development of chronostratigraphy one important development is the vail curve , which attempts to define a global historical sea-level curve according to inferences from worldwide stratigraphic patterns the branch is concerned with deriving geochronology data for rock units , both directly and inferentially , so that a sequence of time-relative events that created the rocks formation can be derived the ultimate aim of chronostratigraphy is to place dates on the sequence of deposition of all rocks within a geological region , and then to every region , and by extension to provide an entire geologic record of the earth following statistical analysis , the results are used to generate a local magnetostratigraphic column that can then be compared against the global magnetic polarity time scale assise bed ( geology ) conodont biostratigraphy erygmascope ( old instrument for studying strata ) harris matrix important publications in stratigraphy international commission on stratigraphy key bed sedimentary basin analysis sequence stratigraphy sadler effect tectonostratigraphy
