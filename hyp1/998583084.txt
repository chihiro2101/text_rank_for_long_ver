pritchard was also music director of glyndebourne festival opera in sussex , and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the lpo replaced the rpo as glyndebourne 's resident orchestra , providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months during the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared , including danny kaye , duke ellington and tony bennett in the times , joan chissell described the orchestra 's playing as '' worthy of any festival '' pirouet comments that as haitink recorded exclusively for the dutch firm philips it was to be expected that the amsterdam orchestra would be preferred , and in any case the lpo was recording extensively with boult , solti , daniel barenboim and many others in 1973 the lpo was caught up in a recurring phenomenon of london orchestral life : the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city , and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge when haitink announced in 1977 that he would step down as principal conductor at the end of the 1978–79 season , solti , who had been principal guest conductor since 1971 , agreed to succeed him solti stepped down at the end of the jubilee season , and was succeeded by klaus tennstedt , of whom the times commented , '' tennstedt found the orchestra sensitive and flexible , and his players regarded him with a warmth that is by no means universally extended by musicians to their conductors '' his time as chief conductor ( 1983–87 ) was celebrated for its musical achievements , but was marked by his failing health and frequent cancellations unlike his two predecessors tennstedt preferred to record with the lpo rather than major continental or american orchestras ; among the many sets they made together was a complete cycle of mahler 's symphonies for emi in 1984 the lpo and the philharmonia began negotiations that went on for years following an arts council proposal to name one london orchestra as the principal resident orchestra of the festival hall , with concomitant extra funding in 1985 this tradition was broken with the recruitment of john willan , a qualified accountant as well as an alumnus of the royal academy of music and a successful recording producer for emi he continued to appear with the lpo as a guest , with the title of '' conductor laureate '' ; in 1989 richard morrison of the times wrote that the lpo still played better for tennstedt than for anyone else in 1993 another official attempt to create a '' super-orchestra '' at the expense of one or more of the existing london ensembles briefly damaged relations between the lpo and the philharmonia , but the idea was quickly abandoned , and in 1995 , with the consent of the arts council , the two orchestras agreed to share the residency at the festival hall after the departure of welser-möst , the lpo was without a principal conductor for four years under masur , known for his performances of the german symphonic repertoire , the orchestra regained its musical form , and the critic richard s ginell commented that vladimir jurowski , who took over in 2007 '' has inherited an lpo in splendid technical shape , probably having been drilled to a fare-thee-well under masur '' in april 2020 , the lpo announced the appointment of canellakis as its new principal guest conductor , the first female conductor ever named to the post , effective from september 2020 in its early years , the lpo recorded exclusively for columbia , a division of emi the orchestra 's first gramophone set was made before its debut concert ; with sargent and the royal choral society the lpo recorded choruses from messiah and the creation at kingsway hall in september 1932 beecham 's first discs with the orchestra were made in january 1933 , with his ballet suite the origin of design , arranged from music by handel the lpo 's first recording for the label , stravinsky 's petrushka , conducted by ernest ansermet , was followed by a large number of sessions as the company rebuilt its catalogue after the war unlike its london rivals the rpo and the philharmonia ( both of whom recorded for many years only for emi and its associates , with the rarest of exceptions ) , the post-war lpo was not exclusively associated with one company , and as well as decca it recorded for philips , cbs , rca , chandos and many other labels for some years in the 1950s and 1960s the orchestra was contracted to two companies at once , and consequently appeared under the name '' the philharmonic promenade orchestra '' in some of its recordings by the early 2000s the late 20th-century boom in classical recordings had ended , and with studio work in decline for all orchestras , the lpo set up its own cd label in 2005 , featuring recordings taken mainly from live concerts the orchestra played for ten films made during the second world war , and then did little soundtrack work until the 1970s , with the major exception of lawrence of arabia ( 1962 ) the lpo also performed a version of '' move closer to your world '' by wpvi-tv for a brief period in 1996
