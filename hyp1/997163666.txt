in contrast to the simply informative titles usually given to works of early modern political philosophy , such as john locke 's two treatises of government or hobbes 's own earlier work the elements of law , hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise '' samuel mintz suggests that these connotations lend themselves to hobbes 's understanding of political force since both '' leviathan and hobbes 's sovereign are unities compacted out of separate individuals ; they are omnipotent ; they can not be destroyed or divided ; they inspire fear in men ; they do not make pacts with men ; theirs is the dominion of power '' on pain of death the two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure – earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right hobbes describes human psychology without any reference to the summum bonum , or greatest good , as previous thought had done it suggests a number of natural law , although hobbes is quick to point out that they can not properly speaking be called '' laws , '' since there is no one to enforce them the first thing that reason suggests is to seek peace , but that where peace can not be had , to use all of the advantages of war hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust , and every man must be considered to have a right to all things the second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one 's right to all things where others are willing to do the same , to quit the state of nature , and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things hobbes concludes part one by articulating an additional seventeen laws of nature that make the performance of the first two possible and by explaining what it would mean for a sovereign to represent the people even when they disagree with the sovereign the purpose of a commonwealth is given at the start of part ii : the commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner : i authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man , or to this assembly of men , on this condition ; that thou give up , thy right to him , and authorise all his actions in like manner there are three ( monarchy , aristocracy and democracy ) : and only three ; since unlike aristotle he does not sub-divide them into '' good '' and '' deviant '' : and monarchy is the best , on practical grounds : however , the succession is definitely in the gift of the monarch : but , it is not always obvious who the monarch has appointed : however , the answer is : and this means : note that ( perhaps rather radically ) this does not have to be any blood relative : however , practically this means : hobbes presents his own religious theory but states that he would defer to the will of the sovereign ( when that was re-established : again , leviathan was written during the civil war ) as to whether his theory was acceptable hobbes ' materialistic presuppositions also led him to hold a view which was considered highly controversial at the time hobbes also touched upon the sovereign 's ability to tax in leviathan , although he is not as widely cited for his economic theories as he is for his political theories in part iii hobbes seeks to investigate the nature of a christian commonwealth if any person may claim supernatural revelation superior to the civil law , then there would be chaos , and hobbes ' fervent desire is to avoid this hobbes thus begins by establishing that we can not infallibly know another 's personal word to be divine revelation : this is good , but if applied too fervently would lead to all the bible being rejected so , hobbes says , we need a test : and the true test is established by examining the books of scripture , and is : '' seeing therefore miracles now cease '' means that only the books of the bible can be trusted and therefore '' the question truly stated is : by what authority they are made law ? '' unsurprisingly , hobbes concludes that ultimately there is no way to determine this other than the civil power : he discusses the ten commandments , and asks '' who it was that gave to these written tables the obligatory force of laws there is no doubt but they were made laws by god himself : but because a law obliges not , nor is law to any but to them that acknowledge it to be the act of the sovereign , how could the people of israel , that were forbidden to approach the mountain to hear what god said to moses , be obliged to obedience to all those laws which moses propounded to them ? '' and concludes , as before , that '' making of the scripture law , belonged to the civil sovereign however , once hobbes ' initial argument is accepted ( that no-one can know for sure anyone else 's divine revelation ) his conclusion ( the religious power is subordinate to the civil ) follows from his logic the need ( as hobbes saw it ) for the civil sovereign to be supreme arose partly from the many sects that arose around the civil war , and to quash the pope of rome 's challenge , to which hobbes devotes an extensive section by this , hobbes does not mean hell ( he did not believe in hell or purgatory ) chapter xlvi : lastly , for the errors brought in from false or uncertain history , what is all the legend of fictitious miracles in the lives of the saints ; and all the histories of apparitions and ghosts alleged by the doctors of the roman church , to make good their doctrines of hell and purgatory , the power of exorcism , and other doctrines which have no warrant , neither in reason nor scripture ; as also all those traditions which they call the unwritten word of god ; but old wives ' fables ? , but the darkness of ignorance as opposed to the light of true knowledge hobbes sees the main abuse as teaching that the kingdom of god can be found in the church , thus undermining the authority of the civil sovereign hobbes then goes on to criticize what he sees as many of the practices of catholicism : '' now for the worship of saints , and icons , and relics , and other things at this day practiced in the church of rome , i say they are not allowed by the word of god '' hobbes has little time for the various disputing sects of philosophers and objects to what people have taken '' from aristotle 's civil philosophy , they have learned to call all manner of commonwealths but the popular ( such as was at that time the state of athens ) , tyranny '' at the end of this comes an interesting section ( darkness is suppressing true knowledge as well as introducing falsehoods ) , which would appear to bear on the discoveries of galileo galilei '' however , hobbes is quite happy for the truth to be suppressed if necessary : if '' they tend to disorder in government , as countenancing rebellion or sedition ? then let them be silenced , and the teachers punished '' – but only by the civil authority
