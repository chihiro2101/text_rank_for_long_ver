st john ’ s college , oxford was one of the few in england with any provision for fellowship ( medicine ) ; william huffman suggests that the presence of a medical fellow at st john 's college , oxford influenced fludd 's interest in studying medicine during fludd ’ s time at st john ’ s college , the medical fellow in residence was matthew gwinne ; gwinne had previously produced a tract indicating that , while he practiced galen , he was also familiar with the main paracelsus medical work fludd may have encountered gwinne , or his writing , during his time at oxford , providing an additional influence for his later medical philosophy and practice the main requirements to obtain this , at the time , included demonstrating that he ( the supplicant ) had read and understood the required medical texts—primarily those by galen and hippocrates fludd defended three theses following these texts , and on 14 may 1605 , fludd made his supplication fludd was one of the first to support in print the theory of the circulation of the blood of the college 's william harvey to what extent fludd may have actually influenced harvey is still debated , in the context that harvey 's discovery is hard to date precisely while he followed paracelsus in his medical views rather than the ancient authorities , he was also a believer that real wisdom was to be found in the writings of natural magicians while paracelsian in nature , fludd 's own theory on the origin of all things posited that , instead of the tria prima , all species and things stemmed from first , dark chaos , then divine light which acted upon the chaos , which finally brought forth the waters this last element was also called the spirit of the lord , and it made up the passive matter of all other substances , including all secondary elements and the four qualities of the ancients moreover , the fluddean tripartite theory concluded that paracelsus ' own conception of the three primary principles—sulphur , salt and mercury—eventually derived from chaos and light interacting to create variations of the waters , or spirit fludd was heavily reliant on scripture ; in the bible , the number three represented the principium formarum , or the original form this allowed man and earth to approach the infinity of god , and created a universality in sympathy and composition between all things the divine light ( the second of fludd ’ s primary principles ) was the '' active agent '' responsible for creation fludd concluded , from a reading of psalm 19:4— '' in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun '' —that the spirit of the lord was contained literally within the sun , placing it central to fludd ’ s model of the macrocosm this was an application of the sympathies and parallels provided to all of god ’ s creation by fludd ’ s tripartite theory of matter the macrocosmal spirit , carried by the sun , was influenced by astral bodies and changed in composition through such influence huffman , robert fludd and the end of the renaissance ( routledge london & new york , 1988 ) he produced a quick work , the apologia compendiaria , against the claims of libavius that the rosicrucians indulged in heresy , diabolical magic and sedition , made in his analysis confessionis fraternitatis de rosea cruce ( analysis of the confession of the rosy cross ) of 1615 in the third book fludd contends that those filled with the spirit of christ may rise before his second coming it is now seriously doubted that any formal organisation identifiable as the '' brothers of the rose cross '' ( rosicrucians ) ever actually existed in any extant form the theological and philosophical claims circulating under this name appear , to these outsiders , to have been more an intellectual fashion that swept europe at the time of the counter reformation these thinkers suppose that in claiming to be part of a secret cult , scholars of alchemy , the occult , and hermeticism , merely sought that additional prestige by being able to promote their views while claiming exclusive adherence to some revolutionary pan-european secret society between 1607 and 1616 , two anonymous rosicrucian manifestos were published by some anonymous person or group , first in germany and later throughout europe the first manifesto was influenced by the work of the respected hermetic philosopher heinrich khunrath , of hamburg , author of the amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae ( 1609 ) who himself had borrowed generously from the work of john dee it referred favourably to the role played by the illuminati and it featured a convoluted manufactured history dating back to archaic mysteries of the middle east , with references to the kabala and the persian magi others intellectuals and authors later claimed to have published rosicrucian documents in order to ridicule their views it is claimed that the work of john amos comenius and samuel hartlib on early education in england were strongly influenced by rosicrucian ideas , but this has not been proven , and it appears unlikely except in the similarity in their anti-catholic views and emphasis on science education rosicrucianism is also said to have been influential at the time when operative masonry ( a guild of artisans ) was being transformed to speculative masonry—freemasonry—which was a social fraternity , which also originally promoted the scientific and educative view of comenius , hartlib , isaac newton and francis bacon it is said by some that he was '' the great english mystical philosopher of the seventeenth century , a man of immense erudition , of exalted mind , and , to judge by his writings , of extreme personal sanctity '' the real history of the rosicrucians , by arthur edward waite , & 91 ; 1887 & 93 ; , it has also been said that what fludd did was to liberate occultism , both from traditional aristotelian philosophy , and from the coming ( cartesian ) philosophy of his time this work , truth 's golden harrow , remained in manuscript & nbsp ;
