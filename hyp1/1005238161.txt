the world is presented in a top-down perspective so the player character can be moved in eight directions using the d-pad one action button is used for attacking with a sword while the second is mapped to either an equipped magical power or an item from the player 's inventory the primary means of defeating monsters is through the use of four elemental swords scattered throughout the game ( the fifth sword , crystalis , is obtained in the final dungeon ) a man known as draygon , however , revived the forbidden ways of science and combined them with magic the protagonist is assisted by four sages named zebu , tornel , asina , and kensu , primarily in learning magic spells and gaining information about the world and the quest two of the characters from crystalis are subtle nods to earlier snk characters who later became part of the king of fighters series ; the latter two sages , kensu and asina , are based on sie kensou and athena asamiya from the psycho soldier arcade game in the king of fighters series , kensou is well known for his obsession with athena , a quality demonstrated even in crystalis this version , however , is a significantly different game , exemplified by a different opening sequence other major changes include an almost completely new soundtrack , re-translation differences ( for example , draygon is now known as dragonia , as in the japanese version ) and rewriting of story-items and events ( kensu 's body and the dialogue in the dwarven village , for example ) the game now has a longer end due to the incorporation of a new dungeon , the tower dungeon being redone , and the re-ordering of the ultimate and penultimate boss battles , which were excluded from the original game due to space constraints ( draygon 's second form serves as the final boss in the remake as opposed to dyna ) the lower resolution of the game boy color screen , compared to that of the nes , results in a field of view smaller than in the original , making the gbc port more difficult ; some enemies can now attack the player from off-screen gamespot also gave the game boy color port an 8.0 , saying of the original nes release : '' crystalis ' sheer depth - and the quality of its presentation - was without peer , and it is still regarded as a milestone title in the action rpg genre
