he is on course to become a queen 's counsel and people are already talking of his being appointed a judge the audience is allowed just one glimpse of a photo of two heads : farr and barrett seen from the obverse of the print , and the screenplay underscores the fact that only barrett 's tears suggest anything untoward , along with the breaking of social taboos in that they are different classes and far apart in age also , the film promises that farr and laura will remain united and faithful to one another he had proven himself playing war heroes ( the sea shall not have them ; ill met by moonlight ) ; he was the star of the hugely successful doctor film series ; and he was a reliable romantic lead in films like a tale of two cities bogarde was suspected to be homosexual , lived in the same house as his business manager , anthony forwood , and was compelled to be seen occasionally in public with attractive young women he seems not to have hesitated to accept the role of farr , a married lawyer with a homosexual past that he has not quite put behind him bogarde himself wrote the scene in which farr admits to his wife that he is gay and has continued to be attracted to other men despite his earlier assurances to the contrary in his first independent film project in his 34th film , he said in 1965 , '' for the first time i was playing my own age english film critic mark kermode notes her reasons for this included previous theatre work with john gielgud which exposed her to the laws surrounding homosexuality at the time , and that a family friend of hers had committed suicide after being accused of being gay consequently , she felt that the film 's story had to be told the project was originally entitled boy barrett and the name changed to victim late in production an official of the british board of film censors ( bbfc ) had set out its view of homosexuality in film : '' to the great majority of cinema-goers , homosexuality is outside their direct experience and is something which is shocking , distasteful and disgusting '' '' although a number of controversial scenes were cut before the film 's release during discussions with the bbfc , including scenes with teenagers first , a male character says of another man : '' i wanted him '' third , the film implies that homosexuality is a choice , which '' is a dangerous idea to put into the minds of adolescents who see the film '' a few years before the release of victim , the filmmakers of suddenly , last summer ( 1959 ) had persuaded the code censors to allow their film to use homosexuality as a plot device , but only by presenting it through cryptic innuendos , and film had to illustrate the '' horrors of such a lifestyle '' an anonymous reviewer in the times commented that '' victim may not say a great deal about '' the related issues of the nature of 'love ' and gay men 's '' genuine feeling '' for each other , '' but what it does say is reasoned and just ; and it does invite a compassionate consideration of this particular form of human bondage '' however the sight and sound reviewer terence kelly saw problems with the film , and wrote that victim contains '' a tour of the more respectable parts of the london homosexual underworld , with glimpses of the ways in which different men cope with or are destroyed by their abnormality '' '' chris waters however has argued that '' victim took for granted that homosexuality was a social problem that needed to be explored calmly and dispassionately '' as a result of the '' wake of the social dislocations associated with the war and the various anxieties to which they gave rise '' '' as such , he argues that the film portrays homosexuality in a sensationalised way which would have deliberately drawn public attention to the issue , a news report in the new york times described victim as a political work : '' the movie is a dramatized condemnation , based on the wolfenden report , of britain 's laws on homosexuality '' he points out the fact that melville never engages in homosexual acts , but rather '' appears '' to have a '' passionate , unconsummated infatuation with a young man at university london 's west end '' , seen throughout the film that add to '' the strange , occult world of blackmail , conspiracy and shame , and the seediness of a certain type of london , that victim holds up best '' victim became a highly sociology significant film ; many believe it played an influential role in liberalising attitudes and the laws in britain regarding homosexuality alan burton has also highlighted that in spite of attracting '' much criticism and debate , largely in terms of its liberal prescriptions and its ‘ timid ’ handling of a controversial theme '' , confirmed in that a study that victim had '' significant impact on gay men who struggled with their identity and subjectivity at a time when their sexuality was potentially illegal ''
