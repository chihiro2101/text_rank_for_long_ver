it is often scanty in amount and may be very brief , even a single instance of '' spotting on the other hand , not every girl follows the typical pattern , and some girls ovulate before the first menstruation when menarche has failed to occur for more than three years after thelarche , or beyond 16 years of age , the delay is referred to as primary amenorrhea according to a review article , there may also be an association between early age at menarche and breast cancer risk some studies have shown that there may be an association between early or late-age menarche and cardiovascular disease , although the mechanism of the association is not well understood a systematic review has concluded that early age at menarche is also a risk factor for the insulin resistance condition nearly all of the research on these effects has concerned girls , partly because female puberty requires greater physiological resources and partly because menarche involves a clear threshold event that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male in comparison with the effects of genetics , nutrition , and general health , social influences are small , shifting timing by a few months rather than years some of the aspects of family structure and function reported to be independently associated with earlier menarche antenatal and early childhood being non-white having experienced pre-eclampsia in the womb being a singleton low birthweight not having been breast-fed previous exposure to smoking high-conflict family relationships increased incidence of childhood obesity lack of exercise in childhood other research has focused on the effect of childhood stress on timing of puberty , especially female there is more uncertainty and mixed evidence as to whether milder degrees of stress or early-life under-nutrition can accelerate puberty in girls as would be predicted by life history theory and demonstrated in many other mammals effects of such small size can never be confirmed or refuted for any individual child some suggest that childhood stress is caused by precocious puberty recognized later , rather than being the cause of it early onset puberty causes emotional issues at preschool age most older estimates of average timing of menarche were based on observation of a small homogeneous population not necessarily representative of the larger population , or based on recall by adult women , which is also susceptible to various forms of error most sources agree that the average age of menarche in girls in modern societies has declined , though the reasons and the degree remain subjects of controversy a 2011 study found that each 1 & nbsp ; kg/m 2 increase in childhood body-mass index ( bmi ) can be expected to result in a 6.5 % higher absolute risk of early menarche ( before age 12 years ) the rituals are important in determining a status change for girls upon menarche and completion of the ritual , they have become a woman as defined by their culture for young women in many cultures , the first menstruation is a marker that signifies a change in status this party is similar to the quincea√±era in latin america , except that a specific age marks the transition rather than menarche in the united states , public schools have a sex education program that teaches girls about menstruation and what to expect at the onset of menarche ( often this takes place during the 4th grade ) then , and to an extent now , menstruation was a private matter and a girl 's menarche was not a community phenomenon the lines are supposed to represent fertility the nuu-chah-nulth ( also known as the nootka ) believe that physical endurance is the most important quality in young women
