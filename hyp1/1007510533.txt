in contrast , the word chromatocyte meaning '' cell '' ) was adopted for the cells responsible for colour found in birds and mammals this classification system persists to this day , even though the biochemistry of the pigments may be more useful to a scientific understanding of how the cells function many such structures interfere with some wavelengths ( colours ) of light and transmit others , simply because of their scale , so they often produce iridescence , creating different colours when seen from different directions it is found primarily in red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) , which are generated in bone marrow throughout the life of an organism , rather than being formed during embryological development however , vesicles containing pteridine and carotenoids are sometimes found in the same cell , in which case the overall colour depends on the ratio of red and yellow pigments iridophores , sometimes also called guanophores , are chromatophores that reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine while it is likely that other lesser-studied species have complex melanophore pigments , it is nevertheless true that the majority of melanophores studied to date do contain eumelanin exclusively humans have only one class of pigment cell , the mammalian equivalent of melanophores , to generate skin , hair , and eye colour for this reason , and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise , melanophores are by far the most widely studied chromatophore however , some types of synchiropus splendidus do possess vesicles of a cyan biochrome of unknown chemical structure in cells named cyanophores many species are able to translocate the pigment inside their chromatophores , resulting in an apparent change in body colour this process , known as physiological colour change , is most widely studied in melanophores , since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment both types of melanophore are important in physiological colour change as the other biochromatic chromatophores are also capable of pigment translocation , animals with multiple chromatophore types can generate a spectacular array of skin colours by making good use of the divisional effect the control and mechanics of rapid pigment translocation has been well studied in a number of different species , in particular amphibians and teleost fish it has been demonstrated that the process can be under hormone or neuronal control or both and for many species of bony fishes it is known that chromatophores can respond directly to environmental stimuli like visible light , uv-radiation , temperature , ph , chemicals , etc some animals , such as chameleons and anoles , have a highly developed background adaptation response capable of generating a number of different colours very rapidly fish melanophores and iridophores have been found to contain the smooth muscle regulatory proteins calponin and caldesmon studies using mutant fish have demonstrated that transcription factors such as kit , sox10 , and mitf are important in controlling chromatophore differentiation chromatophores are sometimes used in applied research for example , zebrafish larvae are used to study how chromatophores organise and communicate to accurately generate the regular horizontal striped pattern as seen in adult fish recently , the gene responsible for the melanophore-specific golden zebrafish strain , slc24a5 , was shown to have a human equivalent that strongly correlates with skin colour chromatophores are also used as a biomarker of blindness in cold-blooded species , as animals with certain visual defects fail to background adapt to light environments this differs from the mechanism used in fish , amphibians , and reptiles in that the shape of the sacculus is changed , rather than translocating pigment vesicles within the cell
