in early 1954 , a committee of the joint chiefs of staff requested that the two machines be compared for the purpose of using them for a joint numerical weather prediction project based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment the first 701 was delivered to ibm 's world headquarters in new york on january 7 , 1954 , the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the ibm 701 computer to translate from russian to english the mark 1 translating device , which was developed for the us air force , was able to produce its first automated russian-to-english translation in 1959 and was shown to the public in 1964 in 1954 , a group of scientists ran millions of simulated hands of blackjack on an ibm 701 looking to determine the best playing decision for every combination of cards the ibm 701 can claim to be the first computer displaying the potential of artificial intelligence in arthur samuel 's checkers-playing program on february 24 , 1956 the program , which was developed for play on the ibm 701 , was demonstrated to the public on television it is still considered a milestone for artificial intelligence and it offered the public during the early 1960s an example of the capabilities of an electronic computer speedcode was the first high-level programming language created for an ibm computer the language was developed by john backus in 1953 for the ibm 701 to support computation with floating point the ibm 701 system was composed of the following units : ibm 701 - analytical control unit ( cpu ) ibm 706 - electrostatic storage unit ( 2048 words of williams tube memory ) ibm 711 - punched card reader ( 150 cards/min memory could be expanded to a maximum of 4096 words of 36 bits by the addition of a second set of 72 williams tubes or ( later ) by replacing the entire memory with magnetic-core memory ibm 700/7000 series list of ibm products list of vacuum tube computers share ( computing ) strela computer , comparable soviet design amdahl discusses his role in the design of several computers for ibm including the ibm 701 , the ibm 704 and the stretch he discusses his work with nathaniel rochester and ibm 's management of the design process for computers
