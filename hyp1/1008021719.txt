one additional reason for thinking xanthippe 's family was socially prominent was that her eldest son was named lamprocles instead of '' sophroniscus '' after socrates ' father sophroniscus : the ancient greek custom was to name one 's first child after the more illustrious of the two grandfathers '' xenophon , symposium , 2.10 nevertheless , socrates adds that he chose her precisely because of her argumentative spirit : it is the example of the rider who wishes to become an expert horseman : '' none of your soft-mouthed , docile animals for me , '' he says ; '' the horse for me to own must show some spirit '' in the belief , no doubt , if he can manage such an animal , it will be easy enough to deal with every other horse besides i wish to deal with human beings , to associate with man in general ; hence my choice of wife xenophon , symposium 17–19 2.10 perhaps this picture of xanthippe originated with the historical antisthenes , one of socrates ' pupils , since xenophon initially puts this view into his mouth diogenes laërtius 2.36–37 it seems that xenophon 's portrayal of her in his symposium has been the most influential : diogenes laërtius , for example , seems to quote the symposium passage , though he does not mention xenophon by name , and the term '' xanthippe '' has now come to mean any nagging scolding person , especially a shrewish wife plutarch tells of a similar story , reporting that it comes from a work entitled on good birth , but he expresses doubt as to whether it was written by aristotle 3–4 in plutarch 's version of the story , socrates , who was already married , attended to myrto 's financial concerns when she became a widow ; this does not entail marriage an unconfirmed anecdote purports that xanthippe was once so enraged with her husband that she took a chamber pot and poured it out over socrates ' head , which & nbsp ; – according to the tale & nbsp ; – the philosopher accepted with the allegory : '' after thunder comes the rain if you will get for yourself a good wife , you will be happy forever after ; and if by chance you will get a common scold like my xanthippe — why then you will become a philosopher partridge thus : the english victorian poet amy levy wrote a dramatic monologue called '' xantippe '' in his poem '' an acrostic '' , edgar allan poe makes references to her although he ( allegedly purposely ) misspells her name and instead writes 'zantippe ' '' ( book 2 , chapter 7 ) in doctor thorne by anthony trollope , the author says of wives 'there may possibly have been a xantippe here and there , but imogenes are to be found under every bush
