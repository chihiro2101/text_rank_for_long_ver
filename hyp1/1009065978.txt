less frequent symptoms also include loss of limb control and dis-coordination , memory loss , lingering touch and sound sensations , and emotional instability people with certain neurological diseases have also experienced similar visual hallucinations within the category of lilliputian hallucinations , patients may experience either micropsia or macropsia micropsia is an abnormal visual condition , usually occurring in the context of visual hallucination , in which the affected person sees objects as being smaller than they are in reality in addition , some people may , in conjunction with a high fever , experience more intense and overt hallucinations , seeing things that are not there and misinterpreting events and situations sufferers of alice in wonderland syndrome can also often experience paranoia as a result of disturbances in sound perception a person affected by alice in wonderland syndrome may also lose a sense of time , a problem similar to the lack of spatial perspective brought on by visual distortion within this suggested relationship , epsteinâ€“barr virus appears to be the most common cause in children , while for adults it is more commonly associated with migraines one hypothesis is that any condition resulting in a decrease in perfusion of the visual system or visual control centers of the brain may be responsible for the syndrome for example , visual distortions may be a result of transient , localized ischemia ( an inadequate blood supply to an organ or part of the body ) in areas of the visual pathway during migraine attacks additionally , aiws can be presumed if the patient presents symptoms along with migraines and complains of onset during the day ( although it can also occur at night ) however , as there are no established diagnostic criteria for alice in wonderland syndrome , there is likely to be a large degree of variability in the diagnostic process and thus it can be poorly diagnosed often , difficulty lies within the patient 's reluctance to describe their symptoms out of fear of being labeled with a psychiatric disorder nonetheless , it is usually easy to rule out psychosis as those with alice in wonderland syndrome are typically aware that their hallucinations and distorted perceptions are not 'real' younger patients may struggle to describe their unusual symptoms , and thus , one recommended approach is to encourage children to draw their visual illusions during episodes symptoms of aiws do not appear to change in severity over the course of the syndrome , and though the symptoms may acutely impact the patient 's life while they are present , alice in wonderland syndrome typically resolves itself within weeks or months one study on 3,224 adolescents in japan demonstrated the occurrence of macropsia and micropsia to be 6.5 % in boys and 7.3 % in girls , suggesting that the symptoms of aiws may not be particularly rare this also seems to suggest a difference in the male/female ratio of aiws patients todd discovered that several of his patients experienced severe headaches causing them to see and perceive objects as greatly out of proportion there is some speculation that carroll may have written the story using his own direct experience with episodes of micropsia resulting from the numerous migraines he was known to suffer from
