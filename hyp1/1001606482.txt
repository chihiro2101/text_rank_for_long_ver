adolf was the reigning count of a small german state before his election , adolf ’ s political activities had been limited to his role as bundesgenosse of the archbishop of cologne after his election , king adolf of nassau would only rarely be in his home country , having transferred the government there to his burgmen for many years before his death , rudolf had tried to secure the election of his eldest son albert ( albrecht ) as his successor only the count palatine louis ii of upper bavaria '' the rigorous '' promised to choose albert he took the side of the nobles in the core habsburg areas of swabia and in their newly acquired territories in austria , with whom albert was unpopular wenceslaus succeeded in bringing the electors of brandenburg and saxony over to his side : albert ii of saxony signed an elector pact on 29 november 1291 that he would vote the same as wenceslaus ; otto iv of brandenburg made a similar commitment he convinced the archbishop of mainz , , to select a king who would principally serve their interests a few days before the election , on 27 april 1292 , the first of the electors , archbishop siegfried issued the treaty of andernach , stating that for adolf to be chosen king he must promise a long list of acknowledgments of possession ( including the imperial cities of dortmund and duisburg , and the vogtship of essen ) , pledges of imperial cities and castles , and a sum of 25,000 marks in silver furthermore , adolf promised assistance against specifically listed opponents , but also the general promise that he would not admit any enemy of siegfried ii into his council adolf promised the archbishop to ask him first for his coronation only after he had raised the agreed collateral like his counterpart in cologne , the mainz elector also forbade the presence of his opponents in adolf ’ s court on 5 may 1292 in frankfurt am main , the archbishop of mainz , in the name of all the electors , elected adolf king of the germans ( emperor-elect ) thumb at the start of his reign , adolf had neither influence nor power , and was elected rex romanorum because of the electors ' preference for a weak king as he had agreed with the archbishop of cologne , adolf remained in his dominion for four months after his election thus , for example , he confirmed the rights of the nobles and the city of cologne , who had turned against their ruler , and even extended these rights he succeeded , through clever marriage policy , to bring former imperial properties back under the control of the emperor in 1294 , when adolf ’ s rule was at its height , he concluded an alliance with the king edward i of england against france and was awarded 60 000 pounds sterling , which corresponded to 90 000 gold marks he bought the landgraviate from albert in his capacity as king and probably using the payments from england wenceslaus ii of bohemia was not thrilled by the growing power of the emperor on his northern border , especially since adolf had promised to give him the margraviate of meissen first , adolf succeeded in securing his acquisitions diplomatically and provoking the margrave of brandenburg toward active support and the archbishop of mainz and the duke of saxony toward at least acquiescence of the purchase two years later , in the summer of 1296 , adolf proudly announced on the invitation to a court day that he had by his actions significantly increased the possessions of the empire in february 1298 , the situation became alarming for adolf because wenceslaus ii and albert of habsburg put aside their years of disputes over austria and styria , and reached an agreement in the event that adolf was deposed and albert elected in his place in january 1298 , through the efforts of the archbishop of mainz , albert of habsburg was brought to testify before an imperial court in order to find a compromise between adolf and albert on 1 may 1298 , the archbishop of mainz invited the king to his court , so that the dispute could be decided there however , the king , as a party to the conflict , could not at the same time act as judge and saw these charges as a provocation given that albert was raising arms against him , the rightful king therefore , the princes relied on their right to vote , from which also they derived their right to oust a king according to church law , only the pope had the power to depose a king thumb following adolf ’ s deposition came the election of albert i of habsburg as the new king the question is open , for example , whether albert actually initially did not want to accept the choice , as he would later assert against pope boniface viii thumb on 29 august 1309 , albert i ’ s successor , emperor henry vii transferred adolf ’ s remains to the speyer cathedral , where he was buried next to albert , who had been murdered in 1308 this misconception was probably based on confusion with emich i of nassau-hadamar , who after his marriage to anne of nuremberg around 1300 was the holder of kammerstein castle although the duchy of nassau was annexed by prussia in 1866 , duke adolf maintained and renewed the order when he became grand duke of luxembourg
