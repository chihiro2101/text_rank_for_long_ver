when the bodyboarder goes left , they place their left hand on the upper left corner of the nose and place their right arm halfway down the rail of the right side of the board dropknee is when one places their preferred fin forward on the front of the deck with the opposing knee on the bottom end of the board with their fin dragging in the water unlike fiberglass stand-up surfboards , the bodyboards dropknee riders use do n't have fins underneath to help maintain a line on the face of a wave or to stop them sliding out so dropknee riders rely on weight transition from rail to rail to hold a line on a wave and turn/snap on the other hand , the benefit of not having fins underneath the board is that a rider can spin 360 ( forward and reverse ) stand-up consists of standing upright on the board and performing tricks on the face as well as in the air if the board flexes too little or too easily , speed is lost most boards on the market today contain one , two , or three rods ( usually of carbon or graphite ) , referred to as stringers , to strengthen the board , reduce deformation , add stiffness and recoil to the core , thus providing greater speed off bottom turns and transitions on the wave if a single stringer is used , it is placed in the center of the board running parallel to the rails if the wide point of the board is nearer to the nose , the board tends to be best suited to prone riding as the bodyboarder 's weight rests further up on the board boards with more parallel rails or a narrow nose tend to be more ideal for drop-knee and stand-up riding as the rider 's center of gravity tends to rest further back most modern boards are equipped with channels that increase surface area in the critical parts of the board which , in turn , allow it to have varying hold and control on the wave for such reasons , skegs are rarely used today and , even then , almost exclusively by dropknee or stand-up bodyboarders crescent tails are also preferred by beginners , due to being able to perform well in varying conditions the evolution of maneuvers and waves in which it is being done have rendered it one of the most extreme wave riding forms in the world ars ( air roll spin ) : originally completed by australia 's michael eppelstun mike stewart ( hawaii , usa ) is considered the father of modern bodyboarding , acclaimed as one of the best wave riders of all time , and holds nine world titles he has gained reputation and fame for his aggressive riding style and approach in both small and heavy surf paul roach ( california , usa ) is accredited with developing a new style of progressive dropknee riding in both small and large waves he is also considered , by many , as the greatest dropknee rider of all time known for tearing apart waves around the world such as cloud 9 , but best known for his dominance over his local break at dbah in australia known for his fluid yet special and powerful style of surfing , and he 's ranked 7 in the global bodyboarders ranking it was the first women 's event ever held there and initiated the longest running women 's wave sport event in the world
