instruments can be mounted at a cassegrain focus below the primary mirror ; at either of two nasmyth focal points in enclosures on the sides of the telescope mount , to which light can be directed with a tertiary mirror ; or at the prime focus in lieu of a secondary mirror , an arrangement rare on large telescopes , to provide a wide field of view suited to deep wide-field surveys a number of state-of-the-art technologies were worked into the telescope design for example , 261 computer-controlled actuators press the main mirror from underneath , which corrects for primary mirror distortion caused by changes in the telescope orientation the telescope enclosure building is also shaped to improve the quality of astronomical images by minimizing the effects caused by atmospheric turbulence its large field of view , 75 times that of the keck telescopes , and strong light-gathering power are suited for deep wide-field sky surveys upon further examination , coolant from the top unit was found to have leaked over the primary mirror and other parts of the telescope ; hyper suprime-cam ( hsc ) : this 900-megapixel ultra-wide-field ( 1.5Â° field of view ) camera saw first light in 2012 , and will be offered for open-use in 2014 the extremely large wide-field correction optics ( a seven-element lens with some elements up to a meter in diameter ) was manufactured by canon and delivered march 29 , 2011 scexao will initially use the hiciao camera but this will be replaced by charis , an integral field spectrograph , around 2016 .
