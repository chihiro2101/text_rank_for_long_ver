although mitochondrial diseases vary greatly in presentation from person to person , several major clinical categories of these conditions have been defined , based on the most common phenotypic features , symptoms , and signs associated with the particular mutations that tend to cause them an outstanding question and area of research is whether atp depletion or reactive oxygen species are in fact responsible for the observed phenotypic consequences they may also be the result of acquired mitochondrial dysfunction due to adverse effects of drugs , infections , or other environmental causes if only a few of the mtdna copies inherited from the mother are defective , mitochondrial division may cause most of the defective copies to end up in just one of the new mitochondria ( for more detailed inheritance patterns , see human mitochondrial genetics ) mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level ; this phenomenon is called '' threshold expression '' this means that mitochondrial dna disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often other studies have shown that the mechanism may involve the interruption of the mitochondrial signaling process in body cells ( intramyocellular lipids ) using a similar pronuclear transfer technique , researchers at newcastle university led by douglass turnbull successfully transplanted healthy dna in human eggs from women with mitochondrial disease into the eggs of women donors who were unaffected in such cases , ethical questions have been raised regarding biological motherhood , since the child receives genes and gene regulatory molecules three-parent baby ethics using genetic engineering in attempts to produce babies free of mitochondrial disease is controversial in some circles and raises important ethical issues human genetic engineering was used on a small scale to allow infertile women with genetic defects in their mitochondria to have children 572 knapton , sarah ( 1 march 2014 ) 'three-parent babies ' could be born in britain next year the daily telegraph science news , retrieved 1 march 2014 embryonic mitochondrial transplant and protofection have been proposed as a possible treatment for inherited mitochondrial disease , and allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins as a radical treatment for mtdna mutation load charlie gard , a british boy who suffered from mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome ; decisions about his care were taken to various law courts
