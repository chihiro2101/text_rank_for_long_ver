the distance between the two locks was rather more than 50 paces , and the whole space was covered with a great roof like a shed the gates were 'hanging gates ' ; when they were closed the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached , and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out the water level could differ by or at each lock and in the grand canal the level was raised in this way by when a stretch of river is made navigable , a lock is sometimes required to bypass an obstruction such as a rapid , dam , or mill weir – because of the change in river level across the obstacle the longer the cut , the greater the difference in river level between start and end of the cut , so that a very long cut will need additional locks along its length later still , as construction techniques improved , engineers became more willing to cut directly through and across obstacles by constructing long tunnels , cuttings , aqueducts or embankments , or to construct even more technical devices such as inclined planes or boat lifts however , locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions , and are an essential part of even the most modern navigable waterways . : de : sparschleuse die funktionsweise einer sparschleuse for example , the hindenburg-lock ( in hanover , germany , built 1919–1928 ) has two lock chambers of 225 m length , each of which would use 42,000 m 3 of water for a full locking cycle a more recent example is the rhine–main–danube canal with 13 saving locks out of a total of 16 locks on some flights of locks with short intermediate pounds , the pounds are extended sideways – in effect to provide a reservoir to ensure that the pound does not run dry ( in case , for instance , the lock below leaks more than the lock above ) the motive power may be steam or hydraulic , or may come from overbalancing the top caisson with extra water from the upper waterway the plane enabled wide-beam boats to bypass the flight of ten narrow locks , but failure to make improvements at the other end of the arm and high running costs led to its early demise in this and several other cases , the locks were never built , and the marine railway continued to serve on a permanent basis visitors can now take a boat trip on the wheel and be lifted over in a few minutes compared to the time it took when the original lock staircase operated in this underwater lift , the chamber was 80 & nbsp ; ft long and deep and contained a completely enclosed wooden box big enough to take a barge the gates only close off this approach tunnel so do not have to reach the full height of the lock however the approach tunnel proved to be unusable in times of flood and the shaft lock was replaced by a 2-rise staircase in 1768 the proposal is for a long tube of reinforced concrete , of a size to accommodate the boats being lifted , to be built on the slope between the upper and lower levels in replacing a traditional flight or staircase of locks , a considerable time saving is anticipated the '' diagonal lock advisory group '' has identified several sites in britain where the new design could be installed , either on new waterways or canals under restoration in addition to this there will be a boat lift ( a large elevator ) capable of moving a three-thousand-ton ship vertically in one motion locks restrict the maximum size of ship able to navigate a waterway , and some key canals have given rise to the name of standard ship sizes , such as the panamax and the seawaymax
