the 24×24mm square frame provided many advantages , including allowing over 50 exposures per standard roll of leica film instead of 36 see '' heinz kilfitt - photographic camera , 1936 ( robot camera ) '' on this page for kilfitt 's us patent of '' a photographic camera in which the feed of the film is effected automatically by a spring mechanism '' the camera was originally intended to come in two versions : robot i , without motor , and robot ii with a spring motor the first production cameras had a stainless steel body , a spring drive that could shoot 4 frames per second , and a rotary shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/500th second in place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes , the robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage when the shutter release is pressed , a light-blocking shield lifts and the shutter disc rotates a full turn exposing the film through its open sector ; when the pressure is released the light-blocking shield returns to its position behind the lens , and the spring motor advances the film and recocks the shutter the small optical viewfinder could be rotated 90 degrees to permit pictures to be taken in one direction while the photographer was facing in another in 1938 berning introduced the robot ii , a slightly larger camera with some significant improvements but still using the basic mechanism some versions were available with a double-wind motor which could expose 50 frames on one winding this was an electrically driven camera using large cassettes possibly as large as 300 24 x 24mm images in the stress of the automatic pull out , when it was not uncommon for the pilot to black out from the g levels , switching on the bomb damage assessment camera was frequently forgotten robot then introduced the '' junior '' , an economy model with the quality and almost all the features of the '' star '' but without the angle finder or the rewind mechanism since most robot cameras by then were sold for industrial use where the camera was fixed in position , robot also introduced versions without a finder , and even without rewind robot-berning also produced enlarged versions of the robot , the robot royal 18 , 24 and 36 , with built-in rangefinder and with an autoburst mode of operation capable of shooting 6 frames per second it became the centerpiece of the company 's portable document capture , traffic control and security solutions , and continues to be the standard robot camera for instrumentation applications while the robots were capable of sequence photography , the shutter that made this possible placed some constraints upon taking lenses and shutter speeds while the 75mm & nbsp ; sonnar could be used with the aperture set to f/22 , the tele-xenar suffered from some shutter disc vignetting unless opened more the lack of a rangefinder on the robot and robot star required zone focusing of these long lenses : every shot had to be estimated or premeasured the standard 38 & nbsp ; mm f/2.8 xenar lenses were extremely sharp , even by today 's standards , and zone focusing worked well on rapid action with short focal length lenses the square frame was big enough , with modern films , for 8 × 10 '' or greater enlargements , and 50 pictures could be taken on a standard 36-exposure roll
