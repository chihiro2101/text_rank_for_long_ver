the valuation tribunal service has cleared up many previous doubts regarding the exact nature of council tax and states that : all persons normally resident in a property are counted for council tax liability though it is often concluded that the full council tax charge must , therefore , be based on two or more adults being resident at a property , this is not strictly true the legislation also provides that , to count as a resident of a property , an individual should have the property as their sole or main residence ; case law has established that no single test may be used to determine whether this condition is met as part of the national fraud initiative , every other year , the audit commission analyses metadata deriving from council tax accounts together with the full electoral register to produce lists of people it believes should be subjected to an investigation on the basis that there is a risk that a discount is being received when an adult who does not fail to be disregarded is actually resident in the dwelling if a property has been adapted to meet the needs of a disabled occupant , then , after applying in writing , and provided the adaptations are of a certain extent , the property will be rebanded to the band immediately below its normal council tax band these rules are now officially known as council tax reduction schemes , though many councils market them to residents as council tax support ; the choice to market the rules as a tax cut , rather than a benefit , may be an ideological one since these powers replace the former statutory rebate schemes , the government has also restricted the councils from increasing , by more than a certain amount , the net council tax bill for any individual who previously received a rebate the consequent reduction rules vary from one local authority to another , with some councils keeping the same rules as the rebate schemes they replace , while others took the opportunity to levy a small level of tax on people with low incomes under these latter application schemes , claimants would often contact the responsible central government department , who would then forward the details to the local authority since 2013 , explicit council tax discounts have been provided instead the local authorities have been given the right to choose their own rules for the discounts , within certain bounds , but many local authorities choose to use similar or identical rules to the former statutory rebate schemes however , no reduction was imposed if the claimant or their partner needed substantial care ; this qualification was met if , and only if , the claimant was : registered blind , or in receipt of the care component ( any rate ) of disability living allowance , or severe disablement allowance , or exceptionally severe disablement allowance no contribution was expected from non-dependant who would themselves qualify for council tax benefit , were not counted towards the number of residents liable for council tax ( for example , due to being a student ) , were normally resident elsewhere , or were not adults in scotland , criticism has been levied not so much at the principle of the tax , but at its debt collection arrangements : community charge and council tax debts can be pursued up to 40 years later â€“ few people will have conserved their payment receipts for such a long time and as such are unable to prove that they paid although wilson 's bill has not made any progress , the scottish parliament has passed the community charge debt ( scotland ) bill to stop councils pursuing debts from the older community charge , though there are some scrutiny stages to go through before it can become law the ability to collect council tax debt , in line with other debts , expires six years after the amount become due unless a liability order has been granted by a magistrates ' court this allows a local authority to chase debts many years after the original liability order was granted
