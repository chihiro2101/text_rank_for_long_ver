it is also one of the oldest squadrons in the air force , its origins dating to the organization of the 30th aero squadron , formed at kelly field , texas , on 13 june 1917 as the squadron performs no more than 88 air demonstrations each year , replacements must be trained for about half of the team each year , in order to provide a constant mix of experience the f-16 has been the demonstration aircraft for the thunderbirds since the 1983 season in january 1982 , four members of the squadron were killed in what became known as the '' diamond crash '' of t-38 talon aircraft which the squadron had flown since 1974 partially as a result of that accident , the squadron switched to the f-16a , and sat out the 1982 airshow season and spent that year retraining and transitioning over to the new aircraft to ready themselves for the 1983 season in rebuilding the thunderbird team , the air force recruited previous thunderbird pilots , qualified each in the f-16a , and had them begin by flying '' two-ship '' maneuvers , then expanded the program one airplane at a time up to the full six airplanes other than those modifications , the aircraft are taken from the standard usaf inventory as production fighters , and can be returned to an operational squadron in short order without any major modification ; general dynamics f-16a/b fighting falcon : during the switch to the f-16a the thunderbirds acquired new block 15 aircraft which they operated from 1983 to 1991 , making the team one of the last usaf units flying the older f-16a 's before transitioning into new c 's they also operated the two-seat f-16b during this time for training new pilots and for vip flights , these being replaced by the f-16d when the rest of the squadron transitioned to the f-16c diamond : historically , as thunderbirds 1 through 4 lift off , the slot aircraft slips immediately into position behind 1 to create the signature diamond formation some of their maneuvers include both solo aircraft at once , such as opposing passes ( passing in close proximity to each other ) and mirror formations ( two aircraft being flown back-to-back in the calypso pass or belly-to-belly ) at the end of the routine , all six aircraft join in formation , forming the delta during its operational history , the 30th served in world war i as a training unit in france , its mission to train fighter pilots to go into combat on the western front after six months training in an unofficial status , the thunderbirds were activated on 25 may 1953 as the 3600th air demonstration team at luke afb , just west of phoenix the team had flown 26 shows by that august the first team leader was major dick catledge ( 1953–1954 ) , and the first plane used by the unit was the straight-wing f-84 thunderjet the next year the thunderbirds performed their first overseas air shows , in a tour of south and central america , and added a permanent solo routine to the demonstration rupert red two : a fighter pilot 's life from thunderbolts to thunderchiefs , zenith press , , p they moved to the swept-wing f-84f thunderstreak aircraft , in which they performed 91 air shows , and received their first assigned support aircraft , a c-119 flying boxcar this switch was accompanied by a relocation of their headquarters to nellis afb , nevada on 1 june because of maintenance and logistical difficulties of basing the f-100s at luke , with their first show after the move being held on 23 june for a time , if the show 's sponsor permitted it , the pilots would create a sonic boom ; this ended when the faa banned supersonic flight over the continental united states the move to nellis also resulted in the first assignment of buildings and hangar space to the team this practice remained in force through the 1973 season the year 1962 saw the introduction of dual solo routines , and the thunderbirds went on their first european deployment in 1963 , the year after the disbanding of the '' skyblazers '' ( see below ) 2 aircraft during a pitch-up maneuver that resulted in the death of capt gene devlin at hamilton air force base on 9 & nbsp ; may in 1969 , the squadron re-equipped with the front-line f-4e phantom , which it flew until 1973 , the only time the thunderbirds would fly jets similar to those of the blue angels as it was the standard fighter for both services in the 1960s and 1970s due to the 1973 oil crisis , the team flew only six air shows and was grounded for some time in 1982 , the thunderbirds suffered a catastrophic loss during pre-season training on while practicing the four-plane diamond loop , the formation impacted the ground at high speed , instantly killing all four pilots : major norman l the team 's activities were suspended for six months pending investigation of the crashes and review of the program , then reinstituted using the general dynamics f-16 fighting falcon in 1983 , , and were upgraded to the f-16c ( now produced by lockheed martin ) in 1992 their 3,000th air show was performed in 1990 , and in 1991 the team went overseas to perform air shows in switzerland , poland , and hungary 3 position , making her the first female to hold a pilot position in the team 's 53-year history additional stops along the way included aerial demonstrations in poland , romania , bulgaria 's graf ignatievo air base , italy , france and england , where the thunderbirds participated in the royal international air tattoo , the world 's largest air show when quebec city celebrated its 400th anniversary , the thunderbirds joined the canadian forces 's snowbirds , the british royal air force 's red arrows , and the united states navy 's blue angels in a ceremonial flight over quebec city later in the year , the team returned to canada for two shows in abbotsford , british columbia the top-rated show '' qualifications of man '' did a one-hour feature on the thunderbirds and resulted from a coordinated media pitch to the network and the republic of korea air force ; republic f-105 thunderchief : only six shows were flown in 1964 using the f-105 before safety concerns resulted in the team 's adoption of the f-100d only three fatal crashes have occurred during air shows , two of them in jets : the first was the death of major joe howard , flying thunderbird no thumb 24 september 1961 : tsgt john lesso of the thunderbirds c-123 crew was killed when an air force c-123 carrying the army golden knights , on which he was flight engineer , crashed during takeoff at an airshow in wilmington , north carolina 6 ( northrop t-38 ) during a low approach during an air show at hill air force base , near ogden , utah immediately after takeoff , stricklin attempted a '' split s '' maneuver ( which he had successfully performed over 200 times ) based on an incorrect mean-sea-level elevation of the airfield , higher than the home base at nellis official procedure for demonstration '' split s '' maneuvers was changed , and the usaf now requires thunderbird pilots and airshow ground controllers to both work in above-msl ( mean-sea-level ) altitudes , as opposed to ground control working in agl ( above-ground-level ) and pilots in msl , which led to two sets of numbers that had to be reconciled by the pilot thunderbird pilots now also climb an extra before performing the split s maneuver while there were no injuries and the aircraft remained flight worthy , the demonstration was immediately terminated , all aircraft returned to gary international airport , and the thunderbirds did not perform on the second day of the chicago show the right wing pilot ( 3 ) was major d 6 , crashed in a field near colorado springs , colorado after performing a flyover at the united states air force academy graduation ceremony the first usaf jet-powered aerobatic demo team was the '' acrojets '' , performing early in 1949 with f-80cs at the usaf fighter school at williams air force base , arizona , and was headed by col ( then capt ) howard w this team flew together until august 1950 , when it was inactivated due to the american commitment to the korean war additionally , there was also a later usafe '' acrojets '' team in germany , this one made up of usaf t-33 shooting star instructor pilots at fürstenfeldbruck ab in the mid-1950s the '' skyblazers '' were the usaf demonstration team representing the united states air forces europe ( usafe ) from the late 1940s through the 1950s the '' four horsemen of the apocalypse '' were a group of four c-130 pilots and their planes who were officially recognized as an aerial demonstration team by the usaf 's tactical air command in 1957 4520th air demonstration squadron 3600th fighter training wing , 25 may 1953 – 23 june 1956 usaf advanced fighter school , 19 november 1956 – 25 february 1967 usaf air demonstration squadron tactical air command , 13 february 1967 usaf tactical fighter weapons center , 25 february 1967 57th wing , 15 february 1974 – present
