one was a dud , and the other exploded on the ocean bottom one of the sub 's two torpedoes hit the stern of a transport as escorts searched the waters nearby , thresher closed and torpedoed the second transport , which had stopped to transfer survivors this blow failed to stop the tanker , which fired her guns to keep thresher at bay as she escaped at high speed prowling north of truk , thresher commenced tracking a five-ship convoy on the morning of 12 november and slipped past two escorts shortly before midnight at 11:43 on 15 january , she came to the surface and spotted a japanese aircraft carrier with an escorting destroyer soon thereafter thresher observed two hits , and the vessel , its bow in the air , was observed in a sinking condition the third ship started firing on thresher with deck guns , passing down the port side at thresher counted some 20 explosions from depth charges before the patrol craft left an hour later upon surfacing , thresher was again alone and set off to patrol along the singapore-to-japan trade route on 26 january , thresher made radar contact with a small convoy and soon spotted two ships steaming along beneath the overcast night skies resuming the approach at 00:20 , thresher doggedly tailed the japanese ship for four hours before reaching a favorable attack position firing her last torpedoes at 04:46 , thresher began to build up speed and had just commenced a turn when one torpedo struck the enemy ship , causing a tremendous explosion well within the range of shore-based aircraft , thresher quit the chase she sighted only two enemy ships and was unable to attack either , before she returned to pearl harbor on 8 may ( flying his flag in guardfish ) , the group picked up '' ditching signals '' from a downed aircraft that afternoon and changed course to investigate arriving in the vicinity on 27 june , they found only a drop tank and no trace of plane or pilot this drought of targets continued until 11 july , when thresher made radar contact with a group of six ships steaming on the formosa-luzon route three torpedoes sped from the forward tubes toward the lead escort , three to the first freighter four explosions were sighted and as thresher departed at high speed , another six soon after while tube number six was still being reloaded , thresher fired two other bow tubes at the freighter , two more at the oiler , and the remaining full one at the escort ; she then swung about and fired one stern tube at the latter while it could not be ascertained whether or not the last escort went down , the effect of two torpedo hits made it likely he had been heavily damaged ) , thresher stood out of midway on 23 august 1944 , bound for the yellow sea and east china sea on her fourteenth war patrol rounding the southern tip of kyūshū , thresher sighted several small craft before making contact with a minelayer and two subchasers on 10 september thresher was twice frustrated on 13 september , when a large oiler passed far out of reach and a freighter , attacked with four torpedoes , refused to sink another pip , an escort vessel , soon appeared on radar by 21:00 , thresher had maneuvered into position off the enemy 's port bow and waited for the japanese ships to make a zig which would place her at a desirable point for the attack still undetected , thresher quickly came about and fired four stern '' fish '' from thresher retired at high speed when she detected the presence of three additional ships closing rapidly the following day , 26 september , thresher came upon a 5,000-ton oiler and cut loose with four stern tubes from a range of after firing 27 rounds of five-inch ammunition , the boat soon received close return fire which forced her to back off remaining at saipan overnight on 12–13 february , the impromptu wolf pack pushed on toward its assigned patrol areas north of luzon arriving at pearl harbor 20 days later , thresher ended her active combat service , after fifteen war patrols
