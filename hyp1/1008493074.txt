colonial rule over cuba , since the perceived threat of american occupation and a territorial acquisition of cuba by the united states might harm british trade and commercial interests within its own imperial possessions in the west indies however , after the united states made genuine assurances that it would grant cuba 's independence ( which eventually occurred in 1902 under the terms dictated in the platt amendment ) , the british abandoned this policy and ultimately sided with the united states , unlike most other european powers who supported spain in 2002 , academic john moser said that

populist movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , '' with the populist party , for example , '' referring to england as a 'monster ' that had 'seized upon the fresh energy of america and
