the song '' hot summer nights '' was also released that year and was part of the soundtrack for the film top gun with '' kiki '' garcia being the remaining core member , gloria estefan was given top billing and the band 's name was changed to gloria estefan and miami sound machine to capitalize on the lead singer 's mass appeal '' ca n't stay away from you '' , '' anything for you '' and '' 1-2-3 '' were all top charting singles on the adult contemporary hits as well with no other core members remaining other than gloria herself , the '' miami sound machine '' moniker was to be used from that point on for concerts and live performances only by the end of 1988 , none of the originating members of the group that once was miami sound machine were performing with estefan in 2002 , an attempt was made to create a shoot-off '' miami sound machine '' with a new eponymous album ( produced by emilio estefan ) and a completely different lineup consisting of lorena pinot , sohanny gross and carla ramirez without gloria estefan 's signature vocals or any real connection to the preexisting miami sound machine musicians , however , the new project was only met with moderate success in a few select european countries and failed to chart significantly in the united states
