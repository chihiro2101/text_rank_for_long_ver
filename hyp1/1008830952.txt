management of the inventories , with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system , functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs there are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory time – the time lags present in the supply chain , from supplier to user at every stage , requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this lead time economies of scale – ideal condition of '' one unit at a time at a place where a user needs it , when he needs it '' principle tends to incur lots of costs in terms of logistics appreciation in value – in some situations , some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption , or for production special terms used in dealing with inventory management buffer/safety stock reorder level cycle stock ( used in batch processes , it is the available inventory , excluding buffer stock ) de-coupling ( buffer stock held between the machines in a single process which serves as a buffer for the next one allowing smooth flow of work instead of waiting the previous or next machine in the same process ) anticipation stock ( building up extra stock for periods of increased demand – e.g stock ties up cash and , if uncontrolled , it will be impossible to know the actual level of stocks and therefore difficult to keep the costs associated with holding too much or too little inventory under control while the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier , most manufacturing organizations usually divide their '' goods for sale '' inventory into : raw materials – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product the firm 's work in process includes those materials from the time of release to the work floor until they become complete and ready for sale to wholesale or retail customers a '' virtual inventory '' ( also known as a '' bank inventory '' ) enables a group of users to share common parts , especially where their availability at short notice may be critical but they are unlikely to required by more than a few bank members at any one time ) worth of inventory on hand across all products so that the time of runout of all products would be simultaneous in such a case , there is no '' excess inventory '' , that is , inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out holding excess inventory is sub-optimal because the money spent to obtain and the cost of holding it could have been utilized better elsewhere , i.e integrating demand forecasting into inventory management in this way also allows for the prediction of the '' can fit '' point when inventory storage is limited on a per-product basis the technique of inventory proportionality is most appropriate for inventories that remain unseen by the consumer , as opposed to '' keep full '' systems where a retail consumer would like to see full shelves of the product they are buying so as not to think they are buying something old , unwanted or stale ; and differentiated from the '' trigger point '' systems where product is reordered when it hits a certain level ; inventory proportionality is used effectively by just-in-time manufacturing processes and retail applications where the product is hidden from view one early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the united states was for motor fuel it seems that around 1880 relevance lost , johnson and kaplan , harvard business school press , 1987 , p126 there was a change in manufacturing practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products however , the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed hence , high-level financial inventory has these two basic formulas , which relate to the accounting period : cost of beginning inventory at the start of the period + inventory purchases within the period + cost of production within the period cost of goods available cost of goods available − cost of ending inventory at the end of the period cost of goods sold the benefit of these formulas is that the first absorbs all overheads of production and raw material costs into a value of inventory for reporting the ratio may not be able to reflect the usability of future production demand , as well as customer demand it is intentional that financial accounting uses standards that allow the public to compare firms ' performance , cost accounting functions internally to an organization and potentially with much greater flexibility where 'one process ' factories exist , there is a market for the goods created , which establishes an independent market value for the good today , with multistage-process companies , there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process ' ( wip ) this needs to be valued in the accounts , but the valuation is a management decision since there is no market for the partially finished product an organization 's inventory can appear a mixed blessing , since it counts as an asset on the balance sheet , but it also ties up money that could serve for other purposes and requires additional expense for its protection inventory may also cause significant tax expenses , depending on particular countries ' laws regarding depreciation of inventory , as in thor power tool company v in addition to the money tied up by acquiring inventory , inventory also brings associated costs for warehouse space , for utilities , and for insurance to cover staff to handle and protect it from fire and other disasters , obsolescence , shrinkage ( theft and errors ) , and others this effort , known as '' lean production '' will significantly reduce working capital tied up in inventory and reduce manufacturing costs ( see the toyota production system ) this is simple where the cost has not varied across those held in stock ; but where it has , then an agreed method must be derived to evaluate it standard cost accounting uses ratios called efficiencies that compare the labour and materials actually used to produce a good with those that the same goods would have required under '' standard '' conditions unfortunately , standard cost accounting methods developed about 100 years ago , when labor comprised the most important cost in manufactured goods standard methods continue to emphasize labor efficiency even though that resource now constitutes a ( very ) small part of cost in most cases increasing inventory requires increased production , which means that processes must operate at higher rates the manager appears responsible for the excess , even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem '' he offers a substitute , called throughput accounting , that uses throughput ( money for goods sold to customers ) in place of output ( goods produced that may sell or may boost inventory ) and considers labor as a fixed rather than as a variable cost he defines inventory simply as everything the organization owns that it plans to sell , including buildings , machinery , and many other things in addition to the categories listed here throughput accounting recognizes only one class of variable costs : the truly variable costs , like materials and components , which vary directly with the quantity produced finished goods inventories remain balance sheet assets , but labor-efficiency ratios no longer evaluate managers and workers inventories also play an important role in national accounts and the analysis of the business cycle also known as distressed or expired stock , distressed inventory is inventory whose potential to be sold at a normal cost has passed or will soon pass cash conversion cycle consignment stock cost of goods sold economic order quantity inventory investment inventory management software operations research pinch point ( economics ) project production management service level spare part stock management fsn analysis logistics
