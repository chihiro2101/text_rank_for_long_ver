usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function there are four important types of interaction that hold the substrate in a defined orientation and form an enzyme-substrate complex ( es complex ) : hydrogen bonds , van der waals force , hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions the charge distribution on the substrate and active site must be complementary , which means all positive and negative charges must be cancelled out to maintain this defined three-dimensional structure , proteins rely on various types of interactions between their amino acid residues a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction amino acids at the binding site of ubiquitin generally follow the induced fit model , whereas the rest of the protein generally adheres to conformational selection if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency for example , the competitive enzyme inhibitor methylglucoside can bind tightly to the active site of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and perfectly fits into it apart from competitive inhibition , this theory can not explain the mechanism of action of non-competitive inhibition either , as they do not bind to the active site but nevertheless influence catalytic activity this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the entire protein domain could move several nanometers during catalysis this movement of protein surface can create microenvironments that favour the catalysis this model suggests that enzymes exist in a variety of conformations , only some of which are capable of binding to a substrate catalytic residues of the site interact with the substrate to lower the activation energy of a reaction and thereby make it proceed faster during enzyme catalytic reaction , the substrate and active site are brought together in a close proximity firstly , when substrates bind within the active site the thermodynamic activity of it significantly increases than in solution this means the number of substrate molecules involved in the reaction is also increased next , the active site is designed to reorient the substrate to reduce the activation energy for the reaction to occur in addition , this binding is favoured by entropy as the energy cost associated with solution reaction is largely eliminated since solvent can not enter active site in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy the electrostatic states of substrate and active site must be complementary to each other but if the transition state involves the formation of an ion centre then the side chain will now produce a favourable interaction this reaction usually requires cofactors as the amino acid side chains are not strong enough in attracting electrons in some reactions , protons and hydroxide may directly act as acid and base in term of specific acid and specific base catalysis but more often groups in substrate and active site act as brønsted–lowry acid and base in reality , most enzyme mechanisms involve a combination of several different types of catalysis in the active site of this enzyme , three amino acid residues work together to form a catalytic triad which makes up the catalytic site his-57 then acts as a base again to abstract one proton from a water molecule this property allows it to be used in one electron oxidation process as a result , they can fit into the active site and trigger favourable interactions to fill in the space and block substrates from entry they can also induce transient conformational changes in the active site so substrates can not fit perfectly with it they usually bind to a different site on the enzyme and alter the 3-dimensional structure of the active site to block substrates from entry or leaving the enzyme however , irreversible inhibitors form irreversible covalent bonds with the amino acid residues in the active site and never leave this interaction is another mechanism of enzyme regulation allosteric interactions are often present in metabolic pathways and are beneficial in that they allow one step of a reaction to regulate another step they allow an enzyme to have a range of molecular interactions , other than the highly specific active site
