furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color the phenomenon shows how , after the more complex perception system is damaged , people can use the underlying control system to guide hand movements towards an object even though they can not see what they are reaching for hence , visual information can control behavior without producing a conscious sensation this ability of those with blindsight to act as if able to see objects that they are unconscious of suggests that consciousness is not a general property of all parts of the brain , but is produced by specialised parts of it therefore , object identification and object recognition are thought to be separate processes and occur in different areas of the brain , working independently from one another another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person 's visual cortex may be damaged , tiny islands of functioning tissue remain these islands are n't large enough to provide conscious perception , but nevertheless enough for some unconscious visual perception ( 2004 ) processes in biological vision section 7.4 evidence of blindsight can be indirectly observed in children as young as two months , although there is difficulty in determining the type in a patient who is not old enough to answer questions the monkeys were placed in front of a monitor and taught to indicate whether a stationary object or nothing was present in their visual field when a tone was played the monkeys performed very similar to human participants and were unable to perceive the presence of stationary objects outside of their visual field another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there to do this , researchers used another standard test for humans which was similar to the previous study except moving objects were presented in the deficit visual field this showed that the monkey 's ability to detect movement is separate from their ability to consciously detect an object in their deficit visual field , and gave further evidence for the claim that damage to the striate cortex plays a large role in causing the disorder gy 's striate cortical region was damaged through trauma at the age of eight , though for the most part he retained full functionality , gy was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field this ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus ( for example , whether an ' x ' or ' o ' has been presented in the blind field ) a 2011 study found that a young woman with a unilateral lesion of area v1 could scale her grasping movement as she reached out to pick up objects of different sizes placed in her blind field , even though she could not report the sizes of the objects similarly , another patient with unilateral lesion of area v1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field he was able to misstate , as requested , in his left visual field ( with normal conscious vision ) ; but he tended to fail in the task—to state the location correctly—when the stimulus was in his blindsight ( right ) visual field the discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information , even unconscious information , may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field , shape , orientation and movement blindsight is a phenomenon that shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information so even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information , other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields their procedure was to have the participants face the display for a period of time and ask them to tell the researchers when the dots were moving however one of the subjects was not able to accurately determine whether or not blue dots were moving regardless of the brightness contrast , but he/she was able to do so with every other color dot the participant would press a key to indicate whether the line was horizontal or vertical , and could then also indicate to an observer whether or not he/she actually had a feeling that any object was there or not—even if they could n't see anything the participant was able to accurately determine the orientation of the line when the target was cued by an arrow before the appearance of the target , even though these visual stimuli did not equal awareness in the subject who had no vision in that area of his/her visual field the study showed that even without the ability to be visually aware of a stimulus the participant could still focus his/her attention on this object tn was not aware at the time , but the researchers had placed various obstacles in the hallway to test if he could avoid them without conscious use of his sight to put it in a more complex way , recent physiological findings suggest that visual processing takes place along several independent , parallel pathways one system processes information about shape , one about color , and one about movement , location and spatial organization however , some of these people still experience the blindsight phenomenon , though this too is controversial , with some studies showing a limited amount of consciousness without v1 or projections relating to it functional magnetic resonance imaging was has also been employed to conduct brain scans in normal , healthy human volunteers to attempt to demonstrate that visual motion can bypass v1 , through a connection from the lgn to the human middle temporal complex
