the enteric nervous system in humans consists of some 500 million neurons ; alternate source at website : ( including the various types of dogiel cells ) , 0.5 % of the number of neurons in the brain , five times as many as the one hundred million neurons in the human spinal cord , and about as many as in the whole nervous system of a cat the enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system , beginning in the esophagus and extending down to the anus the anatomy of the plexus is similar to the anatomy of the central nervous system the ens is capable of autonomous functions like the coordination of reflexes ; although it receives considerable innervation from the autonomic nervous system , it can and does operate independently of the brain and the spinal cord however , vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed , the enteric nervous system continues to function in vertebrates , the enteric nervous system includes efferent neurons , afferent neurons , and interneurons , all of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes and acting as an integrating center in the absence of cns input more than 90 % of the body 's serotonin lies in the gut , as well as about 50 % of the body 's dopamine , which is currently being studied to further our understanding of its utility in the brain in addition , ens contains support cells which are similar to astroglia of the brain and a diffusion barrier around the capillaries surrounding ganglia which is similar to the blood–brain barrier of cerebrum blood vessels in humans and other mammals , peristalsis is found in the smooth muscles of the digestive tract to propel contents through the digestive system specifically , neurogastroenterology focuses on the functions , malfunctions , and the malformations of the sympathetic , parasympathetic , and enteric divisions of the digestive tract basal electrical rhythm homeostatic emotion gut–brain axis human gastrointestinal tract
