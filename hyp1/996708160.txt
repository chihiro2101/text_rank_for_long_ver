a nuclide capable of undergoing fission ( even with a low probability ) after capturing a neutron of high or low energy is referred to as '' fissionable '' uranium-235 fissions with low-energy thermal neutrons because the binding energy resulting from the absorption of a neutron is greater than the critical energy required for fission ; therefore uranium-235 is a fissile material by contrast , the binding energy released by uranium-238 absorbing a thermal neutron is less than the critical energy , so the neutron must possess additional energy for fission to be possible , & nbsp ; are fissionable ) and also produce neutrons from such fission that can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in the correct setting under this definition , the only nuclides that are fissionable but not fissile are those nuclides that can be made to undergo nuclear fission but produce insufficient neutrons , in either energy or number , to sustain a nuclear chain reaction , & nbsp ; a speed of about 14,000 & nbsp ; km/s ) , the fission threshold to cause subsequent fission of , so fission of does not sustain a nuclear chain reaction fast fission of in the secondary stage of a nuclear weapon contributes greatly to yield and to fallout this energy is enough to supply the needed extra energy for fission by slower neutrons , which is important for making fissionable isotopes also fissile to be a useful fuel for nuclear fission chain reactions , the material must : be in the region of the binding energy curve where a fission chain reaction is possible ( i.e
