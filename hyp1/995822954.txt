however , low-flying aircraft presented a very different problem , with very short engagement times and high angular rates of motion , but at the same time less need for ballistic accuracy machine guns had been the preferred weapon against these targets , aimed by eye and swung by hand , but these no longer had the performance needed to deal with the larger and faster aircraft of the 1930s however , existing gunnery control systems were inadequate for the purpose ; the range was too far to '' guess '' the lead , but at the same time close enough that the angle could change faster than the gunners could turn the traversal handles however , it was also very complex , including over 1,000 precision parts and weighing over , even though much of it was made of aluminium to reduce weight setting the system up was also a fairly complex task , and not something that could be done '' on the fly '' in the end they were used almost entirely for static emplacements , field units continuing to rely on their original iron sights or the simple stiffkey-stick sights that were introduced in late 1943 to ease production problems , the army reluctantly standardized on the 40 & nbsp ; mm in february 1941 ; the u.s the predictor 's plans were passed to sperry corporation , who were just commencing production of their own complex high-altitude system , the m7 computing sight , and had no excess capacity to produce the new design as well nevertheless , the predictor demonstrated that effective gunnery required some sort of reasonably powerful computing support , and in 1944 bell labs started delivery of a new system based around an electronic analog computer after a month of limited success against them , every available anti-aircraft gun was moved to the strip of land on the approach to london , and the new sights proved to be more than capable against them as the power of the systems grew , they eventually evolved into motion control photography , a widely used technique in special effects filming
