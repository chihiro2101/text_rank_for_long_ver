kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in tropics conditions than the european strain of honey bee currently in use throughout north , central and south america because their movement through these regions was rapid and largely unassisted by humans , africanized honey bees have earned the reputation of being a notorious invasive species though africanized honey bees display certain behavioral traits that make them less than desirable for commercial beekeeping , excessive defensiveness and swarming foremost , they have now become the dominant type of honey bee for beekeeping in central and south america due to their genetic dominance as well as ability to out-compete their european counterpart , with some beekeepers asserting that they are superior honey producers and pollinators their expansion stopped for a time at eastern texas , possibly due to the large population of european honey bee hives in the area there were discussions about slowing the spread by placing large numbers of docile european-strain hives in strategic locations , particularly at the isthmus of panama , but various national and international agricultural departments could not prevent the bees ' expansion in a study conducted in arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of africanized honey bees could take over weakened european honey bee hives by invading the hive , then killing the european queen and establishing their own queen there are now relatively stable geographic zones in which either africanized honey bees dominate , a mix of africanized and european honey bees is present , or only non-africanized honey bees are found , as in the southern portions of south america or northern north america the reduced available winter forage in northern california means that bees must be fed for early spring buildup the arrival of the africanized honey bee in central america is threatening the ancient art of keeping melipona stingless bees in log gums , although they do not interbreed or directly compete with each other whether this will lead to their extinction is unknown , but they are well adapted to exist in the wild , and there are a number of indigenous plants that the africanized honey bees do not visit , so their fate remains to be seen this may be linked to the high reproductive rate of the africanized honey bee which requires pollen to feed the greater number of larvae natural selection is able to directly shift the set of foraging behaviors by operating on the distribution of these genes in the honey bee population ( pankiw , 2003 ) the popular term '' killer bee '' has only limited scientific meaning today because there is no generally accepted fraction of genetic contribution used to establish a cut-off there are still regions with localized variations that may become identified subspecies in the near future , such as a according to the scientists who analyzed its genetic code , the western honey bee originated in africa and spread to eurasia in two ancient migrations this is supported by dna analyses performed on the bees as they spread northwards ; those that were at the '' vanguard '' were over 90 % african mtdna , indicating an unbroken matriline , but after several years in residence in an area interbreeding with the local european strains , as in brazil , the overall representation of african mtdna drops to some degree population genetics analysis of africanized honey bees in the united states , using a maternally inherited genetic marker , found 12 & nbsp ; distinct mitotypes , and the amount of genetic variation observed supports the idea that there have been multiple introductions of ahb into the united states the small number of honey bees with african ancestry that were introduced to brazil in 1956 , which dispersed and hybridized with existing managed populations of european origin and quickly spread across much of the americas , is an example of a massive biological invasion as earlier told in this article these observations are largely driven by one large gene‚Äêrich 1.4 & nbsp ; mbp segment on chromosome 11 where european haplotypes are present at a significantly elevated frequency and likely confer an adaptive advantage in the africanized honey bee population while studies have shown that africanized honey bees can infiltrate european honey bee colonies and then kill and replace their queen ( thus usurping the hive ) , this is less common than other methods wild and managed colonies will sometimes be seen to fight over honey stores during the dearth ( periods when plants are not flowering ) , but this behavior should not be confused with the aforementioned activity they also return later and basically work under conditions that often keep european honey bees hive-bound studies show that in areas of florida that contain africanized honey bees , the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live it is also becoming apparent that africanized honey bees have another advantage over european honey bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues , including parasites such as varroa destructor , some fungal diseases like chalkbrood and even the mysterious colony collapse disorder which is currently plaguing beekeepers however , this practice can be expensive since these queens must be purchased and shipped from breeder apiaries in areas which are completely free of africanized honey bees , such as the northern u.s and one of the main reasons why central and south american beekeepers have had to learn to manage and work with the existing africanized honey bee any effort to crossbreed virgin european queens with africanized drones will result in the offspring exhibiting africanized traits ; only 26 & nbsp ; escaped swarms in 1957 , and nearly six decades later there does not appear to be a lessening to any noticeable degree of the typical africanized characteristics work has been done in brazil towards this end , but in order to maintain these traits , it is necessary to develop a queen breeding and mating facility in order to requeen colonies and to prevent reintroduction of unwanted genes or characteristics through unintended crossbreeding with feral colonies this is believed to be because the more gentle bees contain genetic material that is more similar to the european honey bee , although they also contain africanized honey bee material also while bee incidents are much less common than they were during the first wave of africanized honey bee colonization , this can be largely attributed to modified and improved bee management techniques
