one of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear if the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills , the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder specifically , children in this group have greater levels of adhd symptoms , neuropsychological deficits , more academic problems , increased family dysfunction and higher likelihood of aggression and violence individuals with adolescent-onset conduct disorder exhibit less impairment than those with the childhood-onset type and are not characterized by similar psychopathology research has shown that there is a greater number of children with adolescent-onset conduct disorder than those with childhood-onset , suggesting that adolescent-onset conduct disorder is an exaggeration of developmental behaviors that are typically seen in adolescence , such as rebellion against authority figures and rejection of conventional values nonetheless , many of the individuals who do not meet full criteria for antisocial personality disorder still exhibit a pattern of social and personal impairments or antisocial behaviors children with conduct disorder have a high risk of developing other adjustment problems in this way , there seems to be reciprocal effects of comorbidity with certain disorders , leading to increased overall risk for these youth while it is unlikely that adhd alone is a risk factor for developing conduct disorder , children who exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity along with aggression is associated with the early onset of conduct problems conduct disorder is also highly associated with both substance use and abuse children with conduct disorder have an earlier onset of substance use , as compared to their peers , and also tend to use multiple substances however , substance use disorders themselves can directly or indirectly cause conduct disorder like traits in about half of adolescents who have a substance use disorder as mentioned above , it seems that there is a transactional relationship between substance use and conduct problems , such that aggressive behaviors increase substance use , which leads to increased aggressive behavior a number of interactive risk and protective factors exist that can influence and change outcomes , and in most cases conduct disorder develops due to an interaction and gradual accumulation of risk factors in addition to the risk factors identified under cause , several other variables place youth at increased risk for developing the disorder , including child physical abuse , prenatal alcohol abuse and maternal smoking and pregnancy although the relationship between the disorders is complex , it seems as if learning disabilities result from a combination of adhd , a history of academic difficulty and failure , and long-standing socialization difficulties with family and peers however , confounding variables , such as language deficits , ses disadvantage , or neurodevelopmental delay also need to be considered in this relationship , as they could help explain some of the association between conduct disorder and learning problems in terms of cognitive function , intelligence and cognitive deficits are common amongst youths with conduct disorder , particularly those with early-onset and have intelligence quotients ( iq ) one standard deviation below the mean lynham , d beyond difficulties in executive function , neurological research on youth with conduct disorder also demonstrate differences in brain anatomy and function that reflect the behaviors and mental anomalies associated in conduct disorder compared to normal controls , youths with early and adolescent onset of conduct disorder displayed reduced responses in brain regions associated with social behavior ( i.e this provides a neural explanation for why youths with conduct disorder may be more likely to repeat poor decision making patterns this reduction has been linked to difficulty processing social emotional stimuli , regardless of the age of onset taken together , these findings may account for some of the variance in the psychological and behavioral patterns of youth with conduct disorder aside from findings related to neurological and neurochemical profiles of youth with conduct disorder , intraindividual factors such as genetics may also be relevant however , these factors are difficult to tease apart from other demographic variables that are known to be linked with conduct disorder , including poverty and low socioeconomic status family functioning and parent-child interactions also play a substantial role in childhood aggression and conduct disorder , with low levels of parental involvement , inadequate supervision , and unpredictable discipline practices reinforcing youth 's defiant behaviors in a separate study by bonin and colleagues , parenting programs were shown to positively affect child behavior and reduce costs to the public sector in addition to the individual and social factors associated with conduct disorder , research has highlighted the importance of environment and context in youth with antisocial behavior it is diagnosed based on a prolonged pattern of antisocial behaviour such as serious violation of laws and social norms and rules in people younger than the age of 18 almost all adolescents who have a substance use disorder have conduct disorder-like traits , but after successful treatment of the substance use disorder , about half of these adolescents no longer display conduct disorder-like symptoms therefore , it is important to exclude a substance-induced cause and instead address the substance use disorder prior to making a psychiatric diagnosis of conduct disorder moreover , conduct disorder in females is linked to several negative outcomes , such as antisocial personality disorder and early pregnancy , suggesting that sex differences in disruptive behaviors need to be more fully understood
