at the start of the second punic war , masinissa fought for carthage against syphax , the king of the masaesyli of western numidia ( present day algeria ) , who had allied himself with the romans meanwhile , with the carthaginians having been driven from hispania , masinissa concluded that rome was winning the war against carthage and therefore decided to defect to rome this decision was aided by the move by scipio africanus to free masinissa 's nephew , massiva , whom the romans had captured when he had disobeyed his uncle and ridden into battle masinissa joined the roman forces and participated in the victorious battle of the great plains ( 203 ) the second punic war was over and for his services masinissa received the kingdom of syphax , and became king of numidia with roman backing , masinissa established his own kingdom of numidia , west of carthage , with cirta — present day constantine — as its capital city all through his reign , masinissa extended his territory , and he was cooperating with rome when , towards the end of his life , he provoked carthage to go to war against him outraged with their conduct , carthage went to war against them , in defiance of the roman treaty forbidding them to make war on anyone , thus precipitating the third punic war ( 149–146 bc ) masinissa showed his displeasure when the roman army arrived in africa in 149 bc , but he died early in 148 bc without a breach in the alliance ancient accounts suggest masinissa lived beyond the age of 90 and was apparently still personally leading the armies of his kingdom when he died
