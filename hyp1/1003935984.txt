other studies find anywhere from 10–69 % , depending on the definitions and methods used for instance kratochvíl ( 1994 ) surveyed 200 women and found that 6 % reported ejaculating , an additional 13 % had some experience and about 60 % reported release of fluid without actual gushing the suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women 's health writer rebecca chalker as '' one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology '' female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical , medical , and biological literature throughout recorded history one sex two sex theory this century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function , in particular the work of the bartholin family in denmark he identified xiii:212 the various controversies regarding the ejaculate and its origin , but stated he believed that this fluid '' which rushes out with such impetus during venereal combat or libidinous imagining '' was derived from a number of sources , including the vagina , urinary tract , cervix and uterus & nbsp ; 135 ) – '' female ejaculation is an erroneous but widespread concept '' , and even twenty years later in 1982 , masters wh , johnson ve , kolodny rc this latter paper , which traces the history of the controversies to that point , and a series of three papers in 1981 by beverly whipple and colleagues in the journal of sex research , became the focal point of the current debate personal communication , cited by chalker 2000 p.125 as sevely and bennett point out , this is '' not new knowledge , but a rediscovery of lost awareness that should contribute towards reshaping our view of female sexuality '' & nbsp ; 74–5 ) historically in rwanda , the kunyaza sexual technique has the reputation of triggering female ejaculation ( kunyara ) research has used highly selected individuals , case studies , or very small numbers of subjects , making generalization difficult for instance , much of the research into the nature of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is or contains urine stated that '' many individuals refer to any fluid expressed from the vagina or urethra during coitus as female ejaculate , which leads to significant confusion in the literature further methodological issues include the fact that the composition of the fluid appears to vary with the menstrual cycle , and that the biochemical profile of the para-urethral tissues varies with age whether the fluid is secreted by the skene 's gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion ; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals , and are related to doubts over the existence of the g-spot , there is substantial evidence that the skene 's gland is the source of female ejaculation these terms are used by the public interchangeably , which often leads to confusion towards the later part of the 20th century , there was significant confusion between female ejaculation and coital incontinence in 1982 , bohlen explained the accepted wisdom : scientific studies from the 1980s and later have demonstrated that the substance produced is distinct from urine , though it does show similarities such as alkalinity with urine a recent study of women who report ejaculation found no evidence of any urological problems , suggesting these two conditions ( ejaculation and coital incontinence ) are quite distinct physiologically , although perhaps not always distinguishable in a particular individual 's mind davidson 's study of 1,289 women found that the sensation of ejaculation was very similar to that of urination it may be important for physicians to establish whether there is in fact any incontinence in women who report ejaculation , to avoid unnecessary interventions in individual cases , the exact source of any reported discharge may not be obvious without further investigation early work was contradictory ; the initial study on one woman by addiego and colleagues , reported in 1981 , could not be confirmed in a subsequent study on 11 women in 1983 , but was confirmed in another 7 women in 1984 in 1985 , a different group studied 27 women and found only urine , suggesting that results depend critically on the methods used regardless of the facts relating to the details of female ejaculation , the social significance of the popular accounts through the feminist health care movement has been considerable the debate in the current literature focuses on three threads : the existence of female ejaculation , its source ( s ) and composition , and its relationship to theories of female sexuality j sex marital therapy 12 : 217 , 1986 states that direct experimentation fails to provide any evidence bell further questions why feminists have not been more outspoken in defense of women 's control over female ejaculation , pointing out that the literature frames the discussion in only five separate ways ; procreation , sexual pleasure , deviance , pathology , and a scientific mystery the book discussed female ejaculation and brought the issue back into discussions of women 's sexuality both in the medical community and among the general public the chapter on 'female ejaculation ' is largely based on anecdotal testimony , and illustrates another issue in the debate , the weight placed on anecdotes and small numbers of observations rather than biomedical investigation or clinical trials advances another feminist theory : that because women 's pleasure in their sexuality has been historically excluded , the pleasure of ejaculation has been either discounted or appropriated by health professionals as a physiological phenomenon whipple continued to publicise her discoveries , including a 9 min video made in 1981 orgasmic expulsions of fluid in the sexually stimulated female in 1984 , the journal of sex research described the debate surrounding female ejaculation as 'heated' josephine sevely then followed up her 1978 study by publishing '' eve 's secrets : a new theory of female sexuality '' in 1987 , emphasising an integrated rather than fragmented approach to understanding female sexuality , with the clitoris , vagina and urethra depicted as a single sexual organ anchor press ny 1986 , page 185 and colleagues who see this new sexuality as one that privileges the male in control , penile retention and body position , but this is denied by others others suppressed sexual climax , and sought medical advice for this '' problem '' , and even underwent surgery contemporary women 's health literature summarises what is considered factual as being that the amount of fluid varies greatly and may be unnoticeable , occurs with or without vaginal stimulation , and may accompany orgasm or merely intense sexual pleasure , and orgasm may occur without ejaculation whether it can be learned or not , women report that they can induce it by enhancing their sexual response regardless , countless workshops now exist to teach women that learning how to ejaculate is an important form of feminine sexual expression in the united kingdom , the british board of film classification has requested cuts to pornographic films alleged to show female ejaculation , claiming that the expert medical advice it received was that there is no such thing as female ejaculation , and therefore the films showed urolagnia , female ejaculation and censorship in the uk the board later stated instead that it does not take any view on whether female ejaculation exists and explained that all apparent examples presented to the board were of simple urination masquerading as female ejaculation
