at the southern end of the ruppiner see , weirs can distribute the waters of the rhin either east- or westwards , rejoining the havel in two places apart along a straight line , and more than apart along the course of the river by this canal , the mouth of the havel , that naturally would be near havelberg , is placed 11 & nbsp ; km downstream whilst its upper reaches carry little other than leisure traffic , further downstream it provides an important link in the german commercial waterway network , carrying traffic from the rhine and the north sea to berlin and poland the stretch of the river between this lock and the junction with the oder–havel canal is administered as part of the obere–havel–wasserstraße , along with various connecting canals and waterways this stretch of the river forms part of the main inland waterway route from germany to poland and carries significant commercial traffic this canal connects to paretz , on the havel downstream , and was built in the 1950s to allow east german vessels to avoid the stretch of the river under the political control of west berlin some further downstream , the berlin-spandau ship canal joins the river on the east bank , providing a connection to central berlin without passing through the lock at spandau the stretch of the river between the confluence with the spree at spandau and the junction with the elbe–havel canal at plaue is administered as part of the lower havel–waterway , which also includes the stretch of river downstream to the confluence with the elbe between spandau and plaue , the river forms part of the main inland waterway route from the rhine and the west of germany , and from hamburg and the north sea ports , to both berlin and poland south of spandau , the river widens into a wide lake , including a large arm known as the großer wannsee , which due to its proximity to berlin can be very busy with leisure craft the teltow canal joins the river from the east via the griebnitzsee just before the city reaches the city of potsdam , providing an alternative route to the oder–spree canal avoiding central berlin leisure craft pass through the centre of the city , using the short brandenburg city canal , a smaller lock , and a stretch of the river a less direct , but more reliable route is available via the elbe–havel canal , the magdeburg water bridge , the mittellandkanal and the elbe lateral canal
