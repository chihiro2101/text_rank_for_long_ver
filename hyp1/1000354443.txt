thus in the first two presidential elections , the electoral college handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected george washington wood , empire of liberty : a history of the early republic , 1789–1815 ( oxford history of the united states ) starting with the 1796 election , congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party 's presidential candidates the first national convention was called by the anti-masonic party in 1831 , as they could not use the caucus system because they had no congressmen the wisconsin direct open primary of 1905 was the first to eliminate the caucus and mandate direct selection of national convention delegates in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention roosevelt proved the most popular candidate , but as most primaries were non-binding '' preference '' shows and held in only fourteen of the-then forty-eight states , the republican nomination went to taft , who controlled the convention after this , a democratic national committee-commissioned panel led by senator george mcgovern – the mcgovern–fraser commission – recommended that states adopt new rules to assure wider participation a large number of states , faced with the need to conform to more detailed rules for the selection of national delegates , chose a presidential primary as an easier way to come into compliance with the new national democratic party rules the result was that many more future delegates would be selected by a state presidential primary the republicans also adopted many more state presidential primaries the first regional primary was the southern super tuesday of march 8 , 1988 , in which nine states united in the idea that a candidate would reflect regional interests the 1988 presidential election in the south : continuity amidst change in southern party politics ( 1991 ) pp 3–20 it failed as all but two of the eight major candidates won at least one primary on that day in 2012 , both the republicans and the democrats moved their florida primary to january 31 , which was an earlier date than past election cycles senate majority leader and nevada senator harry reid was a major proponent of moving that state 's caucuses to january , arguing that nevada would be the perfect american microcosm : its western location , significant minority population , and strong labor population would be more representative of the country as a whole than iowa and new hampshire both the democratic and republican parties , as well as other third parties , have agreed to let these territories participate in the presidential nomination process with the lack of serious competition , the incumbent president 's party may also cancel several state primaries/caucuses to both save money and to show undivided support for the incumbent 's candidacy david weigel , democrats vote to bind most superdelegates to state primary results , washington post ( july 23 , 2016 ) while most states hold primary elections , a handful of states hold caucuses one disadvantage of caucuses is that the state party runs the process directly instead of having the state and local governments run them nearly all states have a binding primary or caucus , in which the results of the election depending on state law or party rules legally bind some or all of the delegates to vote for a particular candidate at the national convention , for a certain number of ballots or until the candidate releases the delegates some states may use a binding walking subcaucus system , where voters may instead be choosing pledged delegates to a local , county or state party convention , which then in turn selects pledged delegates to the national convention a handful of states may also practice non-binding '' beauty contests '' , which are public opinion surveys for use by caucus delegates to select candidates to a state convention , which then in turn selects delegates to the national convention in many states , only voters registered with a party may vote in that party 's primary , known as a closed primary a few states once staged a blanket primary , in which voters could vote for one candidate in multiple primaries , but the practice was struck down by the u.s both the democratic party and the republican party usually modify their delegate selection rules between presidential elections , including how delegates are allocated to each state and territory is based on two main factors : ( 1 ) the proportion of votes each state gave to the democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections , and ( 2 ) the number of electoral votes each state has in the united states electoral college states and territories who schedule their primary or caucus later in the primary season may also get additional bonus delegates states and territories get bonus delegates based on whether it ( if applicable ) has a republican governor , it has gop majorities in one or all chambers of its state legislature , whether one or both of its u.s campaigning for president often begins almost a year before the new hampshire primary , almost two years before the presidential election however , to reduce expenses and encourage turnout , the major parties ' primaries are usually held the same day and may be consolidated with other state elections in reaction to these moves , both the democratic and republican national committees imposed a timing adjustment of scheduling rules , stripping states of delegates if they move their primaries early , such as the case in both the florida democratic primary and the florida republican primary in 2008 the first binding event , in which a candidate can secure convention delegates , is traditionally the iowa caucus , usually held in late january or early february of the presidential election year new hampshire law states the primary shall be held '' on the tuesday at least seven days immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election '' the iowa caucuses are not considered to be '' a similar election '' under new hampshire 's law because the former uses caucuses instead of primary elections should any other state move its primary too close to new hampshire 's , or before , the new hampshire secretary of state is required to reschedule the primary accordingly in recent elections , the iowa caucuses and new hampshire primary have garnered over half the media attention paid to the entire selection process johnson dropped his 1968 presidential reelection bid after performing far below expectations in the democratic party 's new hampshire primary jimmy carter had entered the 1976 presidential race with extremely low name recognition and seemingly little chance against nationally better-known politicians but carter became the democratic party front-runner early on by winning the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary and he went on to win the nomination however , reagan won the new hampshire primary and several others to take the nomination for the republicans , it is considered a '' firewall '' to protect establishment favorites and frontrunners in the presidential nomination race , being designed to stop the momentum of insurgent candidates who could have received a boost from strong showings in iowa and new hampshire because they are the states that traditionally hold their respective contests first , the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary usually attract the most media attention ; however , critics , such as mississippi secretary of state eric clark and tennessee senator william brock , point out that these states are not representative of the united states as a whole : they are overwhelmingly white , more rural , and wealthier than the national average , and neither is in the fast-growing west or south conversely , states that traditionally hold their primaries in june , like california ( the most populous state overall ) and new jersey ( the most densely populated state ) , usually end up having no say in who the presidential candidate will be california lawmakers stated that consolidating their presidential and statewide primary election in june saves them about 100 million , and that it is not worth the cost when there is generally no competitive balance between the two political parties within california in 2005 , the primary commission of the democratic national committee began considering removing iowa and new hampshire from the top of the calendar , but this proposal never gained approval , so those two states remain as the first two contests new hampshire also fought back by obliging candidates who wanted to campaign in the state to pledge to uphold that primary as the first one states vie for earlier primaries to claim greater influence in the nomination process , as the early primaries can act as a signal to the nation , showing which candidates are popular and giving those who perform well early on the advantage of the bandwagon effect in an article from detroit news , tennessee senator bill brock said about front-loading , '' today , too many people in too many states have no voice in the election of our major party nominees populous states objected to the plan , however , because it would have always scheduled their primaries at the end of the season author and political scientist larry sabato is also a proponent of this plan , but his proposal would have the order of regional primaries determined by lottery on january 1 of each presidential election year instead of on a rotating basis in addition , his plan would allow for a few small population states , such as iowa and new hampshire , to hold their primaries in advance of the first region in a 24-year cycle , every state would have a chance to be among the first primary states in the 2008 republican primary , states that ran early primaries were punished by a reduction of 50 % in the number of delegates they could send to the national convention extension of this idea would set timing tiers , under which states that ran earlier primaries would send proportionally fewer delegates to the national convention , and states that waited would get a higher proportional number of delegates to the convention for example , during the 2012 republican primary , florida and several other states still moved their primaries to earlier dates despite being
