like other writers , stern found himself under pressure to have spider-man fight the green goblin again , but did not wish to bring norman osborn or bart hamilton back from the dead , have harry osborn be the green goblin again , or create yet another green goblin stern instead created a new concept as heir to the goblin legacy and developed the hobgoblin stern recounts that he directed romita to base the costume on the green goblin 's but to make it '' a little more medieval-looking '' , while romita asserts that he was given no direction beyond using the green goblin as a basis the hobgoblin 's identity was not initially revealed , generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the spider-man comics according to stern , '' i plotted that first story with no strong idea of who the hobgoblin was in order to throw off the scent and in the same stroke provide a retroactive continuity for his inconsistent characterization of kingsley in his early appearances , stern came up with the idea of kingsley having his brother daniel kingsley sometimes impersonate him , sealing the deception by having the hobgoblin conspicuously appear in the same room as kingsley in amazing spider-man 249 stern 's original plan was to have the hobgoblin 's mystery identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the green goblin 's identity , meaning the truth would be revealed in the amazing spider-man 264 defalco argued that the '' twin brother '' scheme was cheating the readers since there had been no hint that roderick even had a brother ( aside from a single thought bubble ) , much less one who could serve as a body double moreover , he decided that the hobgoblin 's mystery should be prolonged as long as possible , since it was the chief element that made the hobgoblin interesting owsley then wrote the one-shot spider-man vs wolverine in which leeds is killed off ( though the actual death is not shown ) , and instructed the spectacular spider-man writer peter david to reveal the hobgoblin 's identity as the foreigner though the hobgoblin 's posthumous unmasking as leeds was unpopular with fans , david said in a 2009 interview of still being proud of the story , arguing that the hobgoblin being unmasked in a climactic battle with spider-man was the sort of tale readers had already seen countless times before , whereas having an archvillain unmasked in a flashback after having been brutally killed by nameless assassins was unprecedented and shocking he decided to create a name criminal for himself by altering norman osborn 's goblin formula and improve the goblin costume/equipment in order to be the original hobgoblin spider-man : hobgoblin lives 1 ( january 1997 ) when his villainous identity is finally exposed by spider-man and betty brant , he flees to the caribbean to hide from both the law and his enemies donovan ( impersonating the hobgoblin ) attacks new york city but spider-man eventually confronts and unmasks him he was brainwashed to act as a stand-in on many occasions and fool the underworld into thinking that he was the hobgoblin , and was later murdered by the foreigner after the actual supervillain was decided that he was no longer needed he first appeared as the supervillain jack o'lantern before eventually adopting the hobgoblin identity he would act as a body double until being exposed by betty brant while the true hobgoblin gets unmasked by spider-man spectacular spider-man 261 ( september 1998 ) kingsley later returned to new york , posing as his twin brother as the hobgoblin phil urich ( who once used the green goblin identity to operate as a superhero ) took on the hobgoblin identity himself as a supervillain with some new gear ( new body armor , a winged jetpack , and a flaming energy sword ) claude was roderick 's butler who was sent in place and to talk like his master to distract the goblin nation her identity was not revealed to readers ( or to the visiting spider-men of previous eras ) at the time , but her later reappearance in friendly neighborhood spider-man ( also written by david ) revealed her true identity and origin her father always seemed to put his superhero career before raising his own daughter now suited up as the hobgoblin , robin managed to time-travel to the current year , attacking the current spider-man in his reality and derailing an uncle ben from another reality into the present one causing a time paradox the original hobgoblin made his mc2 debut as a hired assassin to kill many of the spider-girl characters , including normie osborn , spider-girl , and peter parker the amazing spider-girl 18 ( may 2008 ) he is later revealed to be the instigator of a mob war against the black tarantula , returning to new york to finish the
