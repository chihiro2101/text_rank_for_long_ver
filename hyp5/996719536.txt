temporal aliasing frequencies in video and cinematography are determined by the frame rate of the camera , but the relative intensity of the aliased frequencies is determined by the shutter timing ( exposure time ) or the use of a temporal aliasing reduction filter during filming '' time filter technical explanation '' like the video camera , most sampling schemes are periodic ; that is , they have a characteristic sampling frequency in time or in space if sampled at a high enough rate , determined by the bandwidth , the original function can , in theory , be perfectly reconstructed from the infinite set of samples that is typically approximated by filtering the original signal to attenuate high frequency components before it is sampled these attenuated high frequency components still generate low-frequency aliases , but typically at low enough amplitudes that they do not cause problems a filter chosen in anticipation of a certain sample frequency is called an anti-aliasing filter when the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies , from rf to if by heterodyne , an unwanted signal , from an rf frequency equally far from the local oscillator ( lo ) frequency as the desired signal , but on the wrong side of the lo , can end up at the same if frequency as the wanted one aliasing occurs whenever the use of discrete elements to capture or produce a continuous signal causes frequency ambiguity spatial aliasing , particular of angular frequency , can occur when reproducing a light field the ( new ) stanford light field archive or sound field with discrete elements , as in 3d displays or wave field synthesis of sound this aliasing is visible in images such as posters with lenticular printing : if they have low angular resolution , then as one moves past them , say from left-to-right , the 2d image does not initially change ( so it appears to move left ) , then as one moves to the next angular image , the image suddenly changes ( so it jumps right ) â€“ and the frequency and amplitude of this side-to-side movement corresponds to the angular resolution of the image ( and , for frequency , the speed of the viewer 's lateral movement ) , which is the angular aliasing of the 4d light field
