the advent of protein sequencing allowed molecular biologists to create phylogenies based on sequence comparison , and to use the differences between sequence homology as a molecular clock to estimate the time since the last universal common ancestor after the 1970s , nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal rna sequences , the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life the content and structure of a genome is the product of the molecular and population genetic forces which act upon that genome novel genetic variants will arise through mutation and will spread and be maintained in populations due to genetic drift or natural selection among these mutations , some will be neutral or beneficial and will remain in the genome unless lost via genetic drift , and others will be detrimental and will be eliminated from the genome by natural selection using the mutation rate per generation and the number of nucleotide differences between two sequences , divergence times can be estimated effectively via the molecular clock the resulting independent inheritance of genes results in more efficient selection , meaning that regions with higher recombination will harbor fewer detrimental mutations , more selectively favored variants , and fewer errors in replication and repair gene conversion is often responsible for homogenizing sequences of duplicate genes over long time periods , reducing nucleotide divergence genetic drift is the change of allele frequencies from one generation to the next due to stochastic effects of random sampling in finite populations many genomic features have been ascribed to accumulation of nearly neutral detrimental mutations as a result of small effective population sizes the principles of population genetics apply similarly to all types of selection , though in fact each may produce distinct effects due to clustering of genes with different functions in different parts of the genome , or due to different properties of genes in particular functional classes for instance , sexual selection could be more likely to affect molecular evolution of the sex chromosomes due to clustering of sex specific genes on the x , y , z or w genome size is influenced by the amount of repetitive dna as well as number of genes in an organism first , repetitive genetic elements can comprise large portions of the genome for many organisms , thereby inflating dna content of the haploid genome secondly , the number of genes is not necessarily indicative of the number of developmental stages or tissue types in an organism an organism with few developmental stages or tissue types may have large numbers of genes that influence non-developmental phenotypes , inflating gene content relative to developmental gene families genome size , independent of gene content , correlates poorly with most physiological traits and many eukaryotes , including mammals , harbor very large amounts of repetitive dna indirect evidence suggests that non-avian theropod dinosaur ancestors of modern birds also had reduced genome sizes , consistent with endothermy and high energetic needs for running speed many bacteria have also experienced selection for small genome size , as time of replication and energy consumption are so tightly correlated with fitness changes in chromosome number can play a key role in speciation , as differing chromosome numbers can serve as a barrier to reproduction in hybrids different organisms house different numbers of genes within their genomes as well as different patterns in the distribution of genes throughout the genome other organisms , like mammals or maize , have large amounts of repetitive dna , long introns , and substantial spacing between different genes the content and distribution of genes within the genome can influence the rate at which certain types of mutations occur and can influence the subsequent evolution of different species genes with longer introns are more likely to recombine due to increased physical distance over the coding sequence new genes arise from several different genetic mechanisms including gene duplication , de novo origination , retrotransposition , chimeric gene formation , recruitment of non-coding sequence , and gene truncation however , duplicated gene sequences can mutate to develop new functions or specialize so that the new gene performs a subset of the original ancestral functions in addition to duplicating whole genes , sometimes only a domain or part of a protein is duplicated so that the resulting gene is an elongated version of the parental gene chimeras often cause regulatory changes and can shuffle protein domains to produce novel adaptive functions the formation of novel genes from scratch typically can not occur within genomic regions of high gene density principles of molecular evolution have also been discovered , and others elucidated and tested using experimentation involving amplification , variation and selection of rapidly proliferating and genetically varying molecular species outside cells the chemical kinetic elucidation of the detailed mechanism of replication ref , ref meant that this type of system was the first molecular evolution system that could be fully characterised on the basis of physical chemical kinetics , later allowing the first models of the genotype to phenotype map based on sequence dependent rna folding and refolding to be produced ref , ref later experiments employed novel combinations of enzymes to elucidate novel aspects of interacting molecular evolution involving population dependent fitness , including work with artificially designed molecular predator prey and cooperative systems of multiple rna and dna ref , ref molecular systematics has been made possible by the availability of techniques for dna sequencing , which allow the determination of the exact sequence of nucleotides or bases in either dna or rna the neutral theory of molecular evolution proposes that most mutations in dna are at locations not important to function or fitness deleterious mutations do not contribute much to dna diversity because they negatively affect fitness and so are removed from the gene pool before long protein evolution describes the changes over time in protein shape , function , and composition due to the degenerate nature of dna , bases can change without affecting the amino acid sequence thus , despite the difference in mutation rates , it is essential to incorporate nucleic acid evolution into the discussion of protein evolution
