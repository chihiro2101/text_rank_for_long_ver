two terms in particular have been in long-standing wide usage : anadromous fish migrate from the sea up ( greek : ἀνά aná , '' up '' and δρόμος drómos , '' course '' ) into fresh water to spawn , such as salmon , striped bass , moyle , p.b myers coined the inclusive term diadromous to refer to all fish that migrate between the sea and fresh water these included amphidromous ( fish that migrate from fresh water to the seas , or vice versa , but not for the purpose of breeding ) , potamodromous ( fish whose migrations occur wholly within fresh water ) , and oceanodromous ( fish that live and migrate wholly in the sea ) image : capelin-iceland.svg thumb right migration of icelandic capelin forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning , feeding and nursery grounds wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish , when feeding , can not distinguish their own offspring these high trophic level oceanodromous species undertake migrations of significant but variable distances across oceans for feeding , often on forage fish , or reproduction , and also have wide geographic distributions thus , these species are found both inside the 200 mile exclusive economic zones and in the high seas outside these zones they are pelagic species , which means they mostly live in the open ocean and do not live near the sea floor , although they may spend part of their life cycle in nearshore waters pacific fishery management council : background : highly migratory species highly migratory species can be compared with straddling stock and transboundary stock however , population genomic research using rad sequencing in yellowfin tuna and albacore has been able to distinguish populations from different ocean basins and reveal fine-scale population structure several pacific salmon ( chinook , coho and steelhead ) have been introduced into the us great lakes , and have become potamodromous , migrating between their natal waters to feeding grounds entirely within fresh water examples are the american eel and the european eel which migrate huge distances from freshwater rivers to spawn in the sargasso sea , and whose subsequent larvae can drift in currents for months and even years before returning to their natal rivers and streams as glass eels or elvers an example of a euryhaline species is the bull shark , which lives in lake nicaragua of central america and the zambezi of africa both these habitats are fresh water , yet bull sharks will also migrate to and from the ocean diel vertical migration is a common behavior ; many marine species move to the surface at night to feed , then return to the depths during daytime a number of large marine fishes , such as the tuna , migrate north and south annually , following temperature variations in the ocean freshwater ( potamodromous ) fish migrations are usually shorter , typically from lake to stream or vice versa , for spawning purposes , malden , ma colorado pikeminnow migrations also display a high degree of homing and the fish may make upstream or downstream migrations to reach very specific spawning locations in whitewater canyons united nations : introduction to the convention on migratory species living north sea – international project on tackling fish migration problems in the north sea region fish migration network – worldwide network of specialist working on the theme fish migration
