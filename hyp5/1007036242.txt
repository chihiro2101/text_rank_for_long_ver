pointedly the british side never asked to see their formal accreditation with the full status of plenipotentiaries , but considered that it had invited them as elected mps : '' this invitation in august had been delayed for over a month by a correspondence in which de valera argued that britain was now negotiating with a sovereign state , a position lloyd george continually denied ratification of the plenipotentiaries on 18 september lloyd george recalled that : on 29 september lloyd george reiterated to de valera that recognition of the irish republic was '' a recognition which no british government can accord '' , and he repeated his invitation for talks on '' ascertaining how the association of ireland with the community of nations known as the british empire may best be reconciled with irish national aspirations '' , to start in london on 11 october , which was tacitly accepted by the irish side 156 , official correspondence relating to the peace negotiations june–september 1921 ( dublin , 1921 ) online version on 7 october de valera signed a letter of accreditation as '' president '' on behalf of the '' government of the republic of ireland '' ( see image ) , but the letter was never requested by the british side arthur griffith ; comment on the delegates ' credentials both the irish and british sides knew that , in the event of failure , the truce agreed in july 1921 would end and the war would inevitably resume , a war that neither side wanted plenipotentiaries usually have full powers to handle negotiations as they see fit , but de valera had given them instructions to refer back to his cabinet on any '' main question '' and with '' the complete text of the draft treaty about to be signed '' , which created difficulties the pro-treaty side was to argue that after 11 october the negotiations had been conducted on the understanding that , even though the british were not negotiating with a sovereign state , the agreement was a significant first step towards irish sovereignty many points still had to be resolved , mainly surrounding the form of an oath to the monarch , but it was clear to all the politicians involved by this stage that a unitary 32-county irish republic was not on offer the final decisions to sign the treaty was made in private discussions at 22 hans place at 11:15am on 5 december 1921 under the terms of the treaty , it required approval by : the parliament of the united kingdom , and a '' meeting summoned for the purpose of approving the treaty of the members elected to sit in the house of commons of southern ireland '' this '' parliament '' had never in fact come into operation ; one formal meeting took place in june , followed by adjournment sine die : see parliament of southern ireland june 1921 meeting those assembled overwhelmingly approved the treaty , nominated michael collins for appointment as chairman of the provisional government and immediately dispersed with no parliamentary business taking place this was the nearest that the house of commons of southern ireland ever came to functioning ; no other meeting ever took place , but the vote on 14 january , in strict compliance with the treaty wording , allowed the british authorities to maintain that the legal niceties had been observed opening the debate on 14 december , president de valera stated his view on procedure : however , when the treaty was ratified by the dáil on 7 january , he refused to accept the vote as final , saying on 10 january that : secret sessions were held on 14 to 17 december , and on the morning of 6 january , to keep the discord out of the press and the public arena on 15 december , robert barton was questioned by kevin o'higgins about his notes on lloyd george 's statement about signing the agreement or facing a renewal of war : '' did mr lloyd george single mr barton out as the left wing of the delegation and did he say , 'the man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war ? ' '' barton replied : '' what he did say was that the signature and the recommendation of every member of the delegation was necessary , or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the treaty '' '' secret debates , 16 dec 1921 ; de valera the crucial private dáil session on 6 january was informed that it could not be told about a private conference of nine tds that had reached a compromise agreement on almost all points the night before most tds wanted at least to be told what matters were still not agreed on , and from this point onwards the pro-treaty members insisted that all sessions should be held in public '' by 6 january , the day before the final vote , de valera acknowledged the deep division within his cabinet : '' when these articles of agreement were signed , the body in which the executive authority of this assembly , and of the state , is vested became as completely split as it was possible for it to become griffith , as president of the dáil , worked with michael collins , who chaired the new provisional government of the irish free state , theoretically answerable to the house of commons of southern ireland , as the treaty laid down thus , the government of the irish free state was free to change any laws previously passed by the british parliament on their behalf although the british government of the day had , since 1914 , desired home rule for the whole of ireland , the british parliament believed that it could not possibly grant complete independence to all of ireland in 1921 without provoking huge sectarian violence between overwhelmingly protestant irish unionists and overwhelmingly catholic irish nationalists even de valera 's proposals made in secret during the treaty debates differed very little in essential matters from the accepted text , and were far short of the autonomous 32-county republic that he publicly claimed to pursue healy wrote to his brother on 11 december 1919 : '' lloyd george said that , if he could get support for a plan whereby the six counties would be left as they are , he would be ready to give the rest of the country dominion home rule , free from imperial taxation , and with control of the customs and excise lloyd george had supported the 1893 home rule bill and the slow process of the 1914 home rule act , and liaised with the irish convention members in 1917–18
