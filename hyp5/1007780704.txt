according to livy , brutus had a number of grievances against his uncle the king amongst them was the fact that tarquinius had put to death a number of the chief men of rome , including brutus ' brother the army received brutus as a hero , and the king 's sons were expelled from the camp livy , ab urbe condita , 1.59-60 in the aftermath following the overthrow brutus is credited by later historians such as tacitus as '' establishing liberty and the consulate '' , a statement that is now believed to be false by modern historians according to livy , brutus ' first act after the expulsion of lucius tarquinius superbus was to bring the people to swear an oath never to allow any man again to be king in rome : : ( by this guiltless blood before the kingly injustice i swear – you and the gods as my witnesses – i make myself the one who will prosecute , by what force i am able , lucius tarquinius superbus along with his wicked wife and the whole house of his freeborn children by sword , by fire , by any means hence , so that neither they nor any one else be suffered to rule rome nevertheless , the spirit of the oath inspired later romans including his descendant marcus junius brutus brutus ' first acts during his consulship , according to livy , included administering an oath to the people of rome to never again accept a king in rome ( see above ) and replenishing the number of senators to 300 from the principal men of the equites livy , ab urbe condita , 2.1-2 during his consulship the royal family made an attempt to regain the throne , firstly by their ambassadors seeking to subvert a number of the leading roman citizens in the tarquinian conspiracy : '' o , you and i have heard our fathers say , : there was a brutus once that would have brookt : th'eternal devil to keep his state in rome : as easily as a king '' one of the main charges of the senatorial faction that plotted against julius caesar after he had the roman senate declare him dictator for life , was that he was attempting to make himself a king , and a co-conspirator cassius , enticed brutus ' direct descendant , marcus junius brutus , to join the conspiracy by referring to his ancestor in the mikado , the protagonist nanki-poo refers to his father the emperor as '' the lucius junius brutus of his race '' , for being willing to enforce his own law even if it means killing his son brutus also had a profound impact on italian patriots , including those who established the ill-fated roman republic in february 1849
