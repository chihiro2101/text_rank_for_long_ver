thus there are hardly any rivers , lakes or other forms of surface water on the plateau in some places , the limestone was more resistant to decay and thus the recession of the main range has left small mountains ( called '' zeugenberge '' — '' witness mountains '' or outliers ; e.g many different types can be found , from dry dripstone caves to caves that can only be entered by boat much of the swabian jura consists of gentle to moderate hills often covered with forest or cleared for small-scale agriculture however , in certain places it is protected by the government of baden-württemberg many large and important fossils were found here the limes actually cuts across the plateau at aalen , which gets its name from the original roman cavalry post , or ala , on the outskirts of the modern town the lack of water and the poor quality of the soil made it a backward region for many villages fetching water required a long journey by horse since water often needed to be stored over a long time , it was often stagnant a modern water supply system ( outstanding for its time ) was built in the late 1880s , which eased the situation locals in the areas speak the distinct german dialect known as swabian german , which varies even throughout the jura and is difficult to understand for speakers of standard german the dialect at the top of the plateau is markedly different from , and stronger than , even the broadest swabian of the lowland areas across the whole swabian region , many phrases and grammar are highly localized , even down to the village level ; however , the swabian dialect of the highland regions is characterised by a sing-song melody , and some of the verb forms are also distinct , not only from standard german , but also from those of the rest of swabia typical of the allemannic tradition are the witches and forest- or well-spirits , who typically signify winter or the forces of nature coming to drive winter out it is also often the case that , while in one town a strong tradition of celebrating fasnet has survived , the neighboring town will have almost no tradition a swabian fasnet celebration in any case has little or nothing in common with the simultaneous celebrations along the middle rhein , which are well known across germany because they are televised every year swabians generally are expected to go to work as normal on rose monday and fat tuesday , unlike their neighbors to the northwest the swabian jura and the neighbouring region have developed from one of the poorest regions of germany to one of its richest within the past 150 & nbsp ; years skiing is sometimes possible ( though the hills are not steep or high ) most of the larger towns are outside the region , though they are often counted as part of it these towns often have some of the highest rents in germany , while land on the plateau itself is considered cheap ( by south german standards ) the region has several larger and many small nature reserves in german , at least outside geological circles , the word alb is used almost universally in place of jura
