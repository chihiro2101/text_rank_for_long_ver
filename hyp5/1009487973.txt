lord montagu formed a company to build a 'motorway like road ' from london to birmingham in 1923 , but it was a further 26 years before the special roads act 1949 was passed , which allowed for the construction of roads limited to specific vehicle classifications , and in the 1950s , the country 's first motorways were given the government go-ahead the m10 spur motorway connected the m1 to the north orbital road ( a405/a414 , a precursor of the m25 ) where it also met the a5 ( now renumbered here as the a5183 ) and , to the east via the a414 , the a6 , which subsequently became part of the m25 although the whole of the first section opened in 1959 , it was built in two parts , with the northern part ( junctions 10 to 18 ) being built by john laing and the southern part ( the st albans bypass ) being built by tarmac limited originally , the m1 was planned to end at doncaster but it was decided to make what was going to be the '' leeds and sheffield spur '' into the primary route , with the section to the a1 ( m ) south of doncaster given the separate motorway number m18 in august 2011 , the highways agency announced that , despite being converted to smart motorway status , the lights will be switched off on stretches of the motorway between junctions 10 ( luton ) and 15 ( northampton ) without affecting road user safety the motorway junctions and their approaches , and a section of the m1 on either side of junction 11 ( north luton ) , would have lighting columns replaced and remain lit between 1996 and 1999 , the m1 section north of the m62 underwent a major reconstruction and extension to take the m1 on a new route to the a1 ( m ) at aberford the new road involved the construction of a series of new junctions , bridges and viaducts to the east of leeds when the new section of m1 was completed and opened on 4 february 1999 , the leeds south eastern motorway section of the m1 was re-designated as the m621 , and the junctions were given new numbers : m621 junctions 4 to 7 the m1 was extended south towards london from its original starting point at junction 5 , in three stages the first stage , opened in 1966 , took the motorway south-east , parallel to the a41 , to meet the a5 at junction 4 south of elstree the second phase continued east to scratchwood ( london gateway services occupies the location of the missing junction 3 from where an unbuilt spur would have connected to the a1 at stirling corner to the north-east ) this slip road is still visible to southbound traffic approximately before junction 2 , and was maintained until the early 2000s , even though not accessible to traffic the northbound slip road from the a1 is now partially used as the entrance way to a retail park and was once carried by bridge , but no longer reaches the northbound carriageway , because it is cut off by the motorway continuing south unrealised plans from the 1960s would have seen the motorway continue through the junction on an elevated roadway to end at west hampstead , where it would have met the north cross route , the northern section of the ringway 1 , a proposed ring of urban motorway around the central area around the same time , the section between the then-m10 and junction 5 was widened from the original two lanes to three in 2006 , plans were published for the widening of from leicester through to leeds ( junctions 21–42 ) to four lanes each way widening was scaled back to the junctions 6a to 10 scheme that was already in progress , and from nottingham and mansfield ( junctions 25–28 ) , and smart motorway was to be used for other sections work began on the section between the m25 and luton ( junctions 6a and 10 ) in 2006 and opened in 2009 , which included the construction of new parallel local–express lanes between junctions 7 and 8 the m10 spur was built as a motorway because it inevitably led to the m1 , but as non-motorway traffic could now travel between the a414 at hemel hempstead and park street roundabout without having to access the m1 , the m10 was downgraded to an a road , and designated as part of the a414 to allow for this modifications were made to junctions 11 and 12 , to allow for four lanes running through each junction , and the a421 road from junction 13 to the bedford southern bypass was also upgraded to two lanes each way during this period
