although this city had been a bitter enemy of the romans in the 490s bc , after both the volsci and aequi later began to wage war against rome , tusculum joined rome , unlike most latin cities soon , the furii integrated into roman society , accumulating a long series of magistrate offices at that time in rome 's history , plebeians could not be elected to the highest magistracy of consul , whereas they could be elected to the office of consular tribune in 406 bc , rome declared war against the rival etrurian city of veii in 401 bc , as the war started to grow increasingly unpopular in rome , camillus was appointed consular tribune he assumed command of the roman army , and within a short time he stormed two allies of veii , falerii and capena , which resisted behind their walls when rome suffered severe defeats in 396 bc , the tenth year of this war , the romans resorted again to camillus , who was named dictator for the first time to finish falerii , which was the last surviving enemy of this war , camillus was made consular tribune again in 394 bc he besieged falerii and , after he rejected as immoral the proposal of a local school teacher who had surrendered most of the local children to the romans , the people of falerii were moved to gratitude , and made peace with rome the entire italian peninsula was impressed by the roman victories of camillus rome had become the most powerful nation of the central peninsula the gauls , who had already invaded most of etruria , reached clusium and its people turned to rome for help however , the roman embassy provoked a skirmish and , then , the gauls marched straight for rome ( july 390 bc ) the entire roman army retreated into the deserted veii whereas most civilians ended at the etruscan caere when the gauls headed for ardea , the exiled camillus , who was now living as a private man , organized the local forces for the defence of the city camillus was hailed then by all other roman exiles throughout the region after he refused a makeshift generalship , a roman messenger sneaked into the capitol and , therein , the senators appointed camillus dictator for a year with the task of confronting the gauls at the roman base of veii , camillus gathered a 12,000-man army with more men joining from throughout the region livy v.10 , vi.4 the gauls may have been ill-prepared for the siege , as an epidemic broke out among them as a result of not burying the dead the gallic and roman armies left the city and fought the next day to confront such a crisis , in 389 bc , camillus , who was military tribune at that time , was appointed roman dictator yet again subsequently , camillus 's army moved south-eastward to defeat the volsci in the battle of maecium , not far from lanuvium ( 389 bc ) on the battlefield , although camillus tried to help with the military actions while located safely in a distant camp , lucius could not cope with his duties so camillus moved onto the battlefield and the romans were able to defeat their enemy because many of the war prisoners were from tusculum , camillus led the romans there and the city was bloodlessly annexed , and its citizens endowed with full roman rights nevertheless , in 368 bc , camillus was appointed roman dictator once more , nominally to conduct the war of velletri a deadly pestilence struck rome , and claimed many roman notables , including camillus , who died in 365 bc
