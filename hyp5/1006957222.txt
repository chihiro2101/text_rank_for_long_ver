this is full circle ringing and quite different from fixed or limited motion bells , which chime below the bell chamber there may be one or more sound chambers , ( one of which is likely to house the clock mechanism if the church has one ) and through which the rope passes before it drops into the ringing chamber or room about from the floor , the rope has a woolen grip called the sally ( usually around long ) while the lower end of the rope is doubled over to form an easily held tail-end each time the bell swings the ringer adds a little more energy to the system , similar to pushing a child 's swing bellringers typically stand in a circle around the ringing chamber , each managing one rope after a controlled pause with the bell , on or close to its balancing point , the ringer rings the backstroke by pulling the tail-end , causing the bell to swing back towards its starting position in change ringing where the order the bells are struck in is constantly altered , it is necessary to time the swing so that this strike occurs with precise positioning within the overall pattern to ring quickly , the bell must not complete the full 360 degrees before swinging back in the opposite direction ; while ringing slowly , the ringer waits with the bell held at the balance , before allowing it to swing back this allows two adjacent bells to reverse positions , the quicker bell passing the slower bell to establish a new pattern even the smallest bell in a tower is much heavier than the person ringing it ( whilst heavier bells exist—for example big ben—they are generally only chimed , either by swinging the bell slightly or having the bell hung dead and using a mechanical hammer this was the original sequence used before change ringing was developed , and change ringing always starts and ends with this sequence two forms of ringing changes have developed ; call changes : where the conductor of the ringing commands each change in call change ringing each different sequence of the bells , known as a '' row '' , is specifically called out by one ringer , the '' conductor '' , who instructs the other ringers how to change their bells ' places from row to row in calling , the conductor usually has a strategy or plan to achieve the desired progression of rows , rather than remembering each call , and an example of these is shown in the example on eight bells conductors can space out the calls at will , but each row is normally struck twice at least because of the difficulty of calling continuous changes the first form is used for calling up and calling down , and the second form swaps the two bells mentioned one of the most important aspects of this is good striking — not only should the bells never clash by sounding at the same moment , the bells should sound to a perfect rhythm , tapping out a steady beat however for method ringing the universal practice is to ring with open handstrokes , even in the south west of england at the annual national 12 bell striking contest the bands are ringing methods and producing a different change approximately every 2.5 seconds , with a gap between bells of 0.21 seconds backstroke ( or backstroke home ) – the part of a bell 's cycle started by pulling on the tail end ( rope end ) in the tower , or with the bells raised in hand ; also : the position at which the back bells come into rounds order at backstroke bob – the commonest type of call in most methods or a class of plainmethod ( in which either dodging takes place or some bells are not just hunting or place making ) ; also can mean ( usually called the '' bob place '' ) the appropriate point in the method ( e.g cambridge – the right place surprise method , one of the standard eight , that is often the first learned cinques – ( pronounced '' sinks '' ) methods for working eleven bells ( possibly with a twelfth covering ) the name deriving from the practice of swapping five pairs of bells clocking – causing a bell to sound while down by pulling a hammer against it ( as a clock would ) or by pulling the clapper against the side of the bell closed leads ( also called cartwheeling ) – handstroke changes follow backstroke changes with no handstroke gap ( unlike open leads ) come round – return to rounds to end a touch ( e.g tenor ) ringing at the end of every row , while the other bells ring a method delight – a treble bob method in which an internal place is made sometimes , but not every time , the treble is going from one dodge to another ( '' cross sections '' ) dodge – changing direction for one stroke in bell ringing ( although strictly a dodge is taking a retrograde step in the middle of a portion of hunting ) dodging practice is an exercise where two bells exchange places on every stroke , sometimes taught to aid learners change from call changes to plain hunt down – either : when the bells are hanging with the mouth lowermost position , or : moving towards the front ( as in '' hunting down '' ) line – the sequence of places a bell rings in a method , or the diagram describing the method ( the convention being that the treble line is shown in red while the others are blue ) slider – a device which allows the bell to go over the balance at each end of its swing , but not to over-rotate up – either : when the bells are raised to the mouth uppermost position , or : moving towards the back ( as in '' hunting up '' )
