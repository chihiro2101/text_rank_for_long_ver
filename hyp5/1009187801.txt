the treaty of paris was signed on 30 march 1856 at the congress of paris with russia on one side of the negotiating table and france , britain , the ottoman empire and the kingdom of sardinia on the other side even amongst the allies , disagreements between nations concerning the nature of the treaty created an uncertain peace , resulting in further diplomatic issues involving the ottoman empire , especially in terms of its relations with the russian empire and the concert of europe russian aims despite losing the war , the russians wanted to ensure that they attained the best possible outcome for the empire at the congress of paris russia knew that within a few months , a total defeat in the war was imminent , which would mean the complete humiliation of russia on an international scale , and further loss of territory peace talks were pursued by alexander ii with britain and france in paris in 1856 as a means of attempting to keep some imperial possession , but also of stopping the deaths of thousands of its army reserves as well as preventing an economic crisis the french blamed many of the defeats of the alliance on the fact that britain had marched into war without a clear plan britain and france desired to ensure that the ottoman empire were made stronger by the treaty of paris , ensuring a stable balance of power in europe britain and france hoped that peace and restricting russian access to key areas , such as the black sea , would allow the ottoman empire to focus on internal issues including rising nationalism in many nations under the empire 's authority without the ottomans being in full control of their empire , the great powers feared that it could lose much of its territory in future wars with the russian empire and the german confederation , eventually strengthening these nations that could pose a significant threat to the french and british 27â€“33 thus , the full removal of russian presence in the danubian provinces and the black sea served both to protect british dominance and to inhibit the russian empire from expanding its influence so readily the ottoman , british and french governments desired a more crushing defeat for russia , which was still crippled in many key areas russia was forced to abandon its claim to protect christians in the ottoman empire , which initially served as part of the pretext for the crimean war the treaty of paris was influenced by the general public in france and britain because the crimean war , was one of the first wars in which the general public received relatively prompt media coverage of the events peace was accelerated in part because the general population of the western allies had greater access to and understanding of political intrigue and foreign policy , and therefore demanded an end to the war the war revealed to the world just how important solving the '' eastern question '' was to the stability of europe ; however , the peace of paris provided no clear answer or guidance the importance of the ottoman empire to britain and france in maintaining the balance of power in the black and the mediterranean seas made many view the signing of the treaty of paris to be the entrance of the ottoman empire to the european international theatre greater penetration of european influence into ottoman international law and a decline in emphasis of islamic practices in their legal system illustrate more of an inclusion of the ottoman empire into european politics and disputes , leading to its major role in the first world war russia , the gendarme of conservatism and the saviour of austria during the hungarian revolution of 1848 , angrily resented the failure of austria to help or assist its former ally , which contributed to russia 's non-intervention in the 1859 franco-austrian war , which meant the end of austrian influence in italy ; in the 1866 austro-prussian war , with the loss of its influence in most german-speaking land ; and in the ausgleich ( compromise ) with hungary of 1867 , which meant the sharing of the power in the danubian empire with the magyars since it would pose a threat to both french borders and british political and economic interest in the east essentially , the war that sought to stabilise power relations in europe brought about by a temporary peace the treaty admitted the ottoman empire to the european concert , and the powers promised to respect its independence and territorial integrity
