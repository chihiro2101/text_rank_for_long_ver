in antiquity , '' natural history '' covered essentially anything connected with nature , or used materials drawn from nature , such as pliny the elder 's natural history ( pliny ) , published circa 77 to 79 ad , which covers astronomy , geography , humans and their technology , medicine , and superstition , as well as animals and plants medieval european academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions : the humanities ( primarily what is now known as classics ) and divinity , with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment the study of nature revived in the renaissance , and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge , itself divided into descriptive natural history and natural philosophy , the analytical study of nature barry barnes and steven shapin , '' natural order : historical studies of scientific culture '' , sage , 1979 for example , while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study , it can also be defined as a body of knowledge , and as a craft or a practice , in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed bartholomew : '' a student of natural history , or a naturalist , studies the world by observing plants and animals directly bartholomew , '' the role of natural history in contemporary biology '' , bioscience 36 ( 1986 ) : 324–329 a common thread in many definitions of natural history is the inclusion of a descriptive component , as seen in a recent definition by h.w greene , '' organisms in nature as a central focus for biology '' , trends in ecology & evolution 20 ( 2005 ) :23–27 several authors have argued for a more expansive view of natural history , including s a slightly different framework for natural history , covering a similar range of themes , is also implied in the scope of work encompassed by many leading natural history museums , which often include elements of anthropology , geology , paleontology , and astronomy along with botany and zoology , american museum of natural history , mission statement field museum , mission statement or include both cultural and natural components of the world the natural history museum , mission statement the plurality of definitions for this field has been recognized as both a weakness and a strength , and a range of definitions has recently been offered by practitioners in a recent collection of views on natural history natural history was understood by pliny the elder to cover anything that could be found in the world , including living things , geology , astronomy , technology , art , and humanity since early modern times , however , a great number of women made contributions to natural history , particularly in the field of botany , be it as authors , collectors , or illustrators natural history , formerly the main subject taught by college science professors , was increasingly scorned by scientists of a more specialized manner and relegated to an '' amateur '' activity , rather than a part of science proper particularly in britain and the united states , this grew into specialist hobbies such as the ornithology , butterflies , seashells ( malacology/conchology ) , beetles , and wildflowers ; meanwhile , scientists tried to define a unified discipline of biology ( though with only partial success , at least until the modern evolutionary synthesis ) still , the traditions of natural history continue to play a part in the study of biology , especially ecology ( the study of natural systems involving living organisms and the inorganic components of the earth 's biosphere that support them ) , ethology ( the scientific study of animal behavior ) , and evolutionary biology ( the study of the relationships between life forms over very long periods of time ) , and re-emerges today as integrative organismal biology particularly back in the 19th century , scientists began to use their natural history collections as teaching tools for advanced students and the basis for their own morphological research peter anstey ( 2011 ) , two forms of natural history , early modern experimental philosophy
