originally , fiberglas was a glass wool with fibers entrapping a great deal of gas , making it useful as an insulator , especially at high temperatures with the combination of fiberglass and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic this reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic , but now for the first time , the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material many glass fiber composites continued to be called '' fiberglass '' ( as a generic name ) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic unlike glass fibers used for insulation , for the final structure to be strong , the fiber 's surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects , as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal tensile strengths if a bulk piece of glass were defect-free , it would be equally as strong as glass fibers ; however , it is generally impractical to produce and maintain bulk material in a defect-free state outside of laboratory conditions these rovings are then either used directly in a composite application such as pultrusion , filament winding ( pipe ) , gun roving ( where an automated gun chops the glass into short lengths and drops it into a jet of resin , projected onto the surface of a mold ) , or in an intermediary step , to manufacture fabrics such as chopped strand mat ( csm ) ( made of randomly oriented small cut lengths of fiber all bonded together ) , woven fabrics , knit fabrics or unidirectional fabrics therefore , if a collection of fibers can be arranged permanently in a preferred direction within a material , and if they can be prevented from buckling in compression , the material will be preferentially strong in that direction furthermore , by laying multiple layers of fiber on top of one another , with each layer oriented in various preferred directions , the material 's overall stiffness and strength can be efficiently controlled a fiberglass component is typically of a thin '' shell '' construction , sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam , as in the case of surfboards the component may be of nearly arbitrary shape , limited only by the complexity and tolerances of the mold used for manufacturing the shell composition : the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics naming and use : pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures s-glass ( '' s '' for '' stiff '' ) is used when tensile strength ( high modulus ) is important and is thus an important building and aircraft epoxy composite ( it is called r-glass , '' r '' for '' reinforcement '' in europe ) in the production of some products , such as aircraft , carbon fiber is now used instead of fiberglass , which is stronger by volume and weight it may also be used to conceal other equipment where no signal permeability is required , such as equipment cabinets and steel support structures , due to the ease with which it can be molded and painted to blend with existing structures and surfaces such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner ( often polypropylene ) is resistant to a wide range of corrosive chemicals the material 's reduced weight and easier handling , compared to wood or metal , allows faster installation mass-produced fiberglass brick-effect panels can be used in the construction of composite housing , and can include insulation to reduce heat loss in rod pumping applications , fiberglass rods are often used for their high tensile strength to weight ratio fiberglass rods must be kept in tension , however , as they frequently part if placed in even a small amount of compression most commercial velomobiles most printed circuit boards consist of alternating layers of copper and fiberglass fr-4 large commercial wind turbine blades rf coils used in mri scanners drum sets sub-sea installation protection covers reinforcement of asphalt pavement , as a fabric or mesh interlayer between lifts helmets and other protective gear used in various sports orthopedic casts frp grating is used for walkways on ships and oil rigs , and in factories fiber-reinforced composite columns water slides sculpture making fish ponds or lining cinder block fish ponds filament winding is a fabrication technique mainly used for manufacturing open ( cylinders ) or closed-end structures ( pressure vessels or tanks ) for some products such as gas bottles , the 'mandrel ' is a permanent part of the finished product forming a liner to prevent gas leakage or as a barrier to protect the composite from the fluid to be stored filament winding is well suited to automation , and there are many applications , such as pipe and small pressure vessels that are wound and cured without any human intervention a release agent , usually in either wax or liquid form , is applied to the chosen mold to allow the finished product to be cleanly removed from the mold additional resin is applied and possibly additional sheets of fiberglass in some cases , the work is covered with plastic sheets and vacuum is drawn on the work to remove air bubbles and press the fiberglass to the shape of the mold the resin and glass may be applied separately or simultaneously '' chopped '' in a combined stream from a chopper gun wood , foam or other core material may then be added , and a secondary spray-up layer imbeds the core between the laminates image : pultrusion process 01.png thumb 300px right diagram of the pultrusion process pultrusion is a manufacturing method used to make strong , lightweight composite materials in pultrusion , material is pulled through forming machinery using either a hand-over-hand method or a continuous-roller method ( as opposed to extrusion , where the material is pushed through dies ) one notable feature of fiberglass is that the resins used are subject to contraction during the curing process further manufacture of grp components ( grinding , cutting , sawing ) creates fine dust and chips containing glass filaments , as well as tacky dust ,
