in the binding of isaac , religious murders & kabbalah , lippman bodoff argues that abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son , and that he had faith that god had no intention that he do so rabbi ari kahn ( on the orthodox union website ) elaborates this view as follows : isaac 's death was never a possibility — not as far as abraham was concerned , and not as far as god was concerned god 's commandment to abraham was very specific , and abraham understood it very precisely : isaac was to be '' raised up as an offering '' , and god would use the opportunity to teach humankind , once and for all , that human sacrifice , child sacrifice , is not acceptable citing the prophet jeremiah 's exhortation against child sacrifice ( chapter 19 ) , they state unequivocally that such behavior '' never crossed god ’ s mind '' , referring specifically to the sacrificial slaughter of isaac the jewish publication society suggests abraham 's apparent complicity with the sacrifice was actually his way of testing god , page 39 , the jewish publication society , 1999 in the guide for the perplexed , maimonides argues that the story of the binding of isaac contains two '' great notions '' in legends of the jews , rabbi louis ginzberg argues that the binding of isaac is a way for god to test isaac 's claim to ishmael , and to silence satan 's protest about abraham who had not brought up any offering to god after isaac was born , also to show a proof to the world that abraham is the true god-fearing man who is ready to fulfill any of god 's commands , even to sacrifice his own son : the book of genesis does not tell the age of isaac at the time the binding of isaac is mentioned in the new testament epistle to the hebrews among many acts of faith recorded in the old testament : '' by faith abraham , when he was tested , offered up isaac , and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son , of whom it was said , 'in isaac your seed shall be called , ' concluding that god was able to raise him up , even from the dead , from which he also received him in a figurative sense other christians from the period saw isaac as a type of the '' word of god '' who prefigured christ origen , homilies on genesis 11–13 this interpretation can be supported by symbolism and context such as abraham sacrificing his son on the third day of the journey ( genesis 22:4 ) , or abraham taking the wood and putting it on his son isaac 's shoulder ( genesis 22:6 ) as further support that the binding of isaac foretells the gospel of jesus christ , when the two went up there , isaac asked abraham '' where is the lamb for the burnt offering '' to which abraham responded '' god himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering , my son in the new testament , john the baptist saw jesus coming toward him and said '' look , the lamb of god , who takes away the sins of the world ! '' ( john 1:29 ) the version in the quran differs from that in genesis in two aspects : the identity of the sacrificed son and the son 's reaction towards the requested sacrifice in islamic sources , when abraham tells his son about the vision , his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of god 's command , and no binding to the altar occurred quran 37:100 the next two verses state god also granted abraham the righteous son isaac and promised more rewards one side of the argument believed it was isaac rather than ishmael ( notably ibn qutaybah and al-tabari ) interpreting the verse '' god 's perfecting his mercy on abraham and isaac '' as referring to his making abraham his closest one , and to his rescuing isaac derrida also looks at the story of the sacrifice as well as kierkegaard 's reading in the gift of death abraham 's sacrifice of faith : a form critical study of genesis & nbsp ; 22 this has suggested to many that the author responsible for the interpolation of the second angelic appearance has left his mark also on the original account ( v this analysis of the story sheds light on the connection between the binding and the story of sodom , in which abraham protests against god 's unethical plan to destroy the city , without distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked : '' far be it from you to do such a thing : shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just ? '' abraham 's ethical rebellion against god in the destruction of sodom culminates in his disobedience to god , refusing to sacrifice isaac francesca stavrakopoulou has speculated that it is possible that the story '' contains traces of a tradition in which abraham does sacrifice isaac '' it may be that the biblical story contains traces of a tradition in which abraham does sacrifice isaac , for in genesis & nbsp ; 22:19 abraham appears to return from the mountain without isaac friedman argued that in the original e story , abraham may have carried out the sacrifice of isaac , but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of je to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for isaac likewise , terence fretheim wrote that the text bears no specific mark of being a polemic against child sacrifice contradictory , the hebrew name list of the children born after the sacrifice , may contain some '' coded '' explanation refuting any possible child sacrifice : re ’ umah ( ראומה ) – '' see what '' tevah ( טבח ) – '' slaughtering of animal '' or '' slaughtered animal '' gaham ( גחם ) – '' flame '' or '' burning '' tahash ( תחש ) – '' animal skin '' ma ‘ akah ( מעכה ) – '' blown '' or '' crushed '' in other words , v
