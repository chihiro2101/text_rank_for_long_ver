frequently considered cases of ghz experiments are concerned with observations obtained by three measurements , a , b , and c , each of which detects one signal at a time in one of two distinct mutually exclusive outcomes ( called channels ) : for instance a detecting and counting a signal either as ( a↑ ) or as ( a↓ ) , b detecting and counting a signal either as ( b « ) or as ( b » ) , and c detecting and counting a signal either as ( c ◊ ) or as ( c ♦ ) for any one signal which has been detected by a in one particular trial , b must have detected precisely one signal in the same trial , and c must have detected precisely one signal in the same trial ; and vice versa for any one particular trial it may be consequently distinguished and counted whether a detected a signal as ( a↑ ) and not as ( a↓ ) , with corresponding counts n t ( a↑ ) 1 and n t ( a↓ ) 0 , in this particular trial t , or a detected a signal as ( a↓ ) and not as ( a↑ ) , with corresponding counts n f ( a↑ ) 0 and n f ( a↓ ) 1 , in this particular trial f , where trials f and t are evidently distinct ; similarly , it can be distinguished and counted whether b detected a signal as ( b « ) and not as ( b » ) , with corresponding counts n g ( b « ) 1 and n g ( b » ) 0 , in this particular trial g , or b detected a signal as ( b » ) and not as ( b « ) , with corresponding counts n h ( b « ) 0 and n h ( b » ) 1 , in this particular trial h , where trials g and h are evidently distinct ; and correspondingly , it can be distinguished and counted whether c detected a signal as ( c ◊ ) and not as ( c ♦ ) , with corresponding counts n l ( c ◊ ) 1 and n l ( c ♦ ) 0 , in this particular trial l , or c detected a signal as ( c ♦ ) and not as ( c ◊ ) , with corresponding counts n m ( c ◊ ) 0 and n m ( c ♦ ) 1 , in this particular trial m , where trials l and m are evidently distinct the notion of local hidden variables is now introduced by considering the following question : can the individual detection outcomes and corresponding counts as obtained by any one observer , e.g as a function only of the setting of this observer in this trial , and of one other hidden parameter λ , but without an explicit dependence on settings or outcomes concerning the other observers ( who are considered far away ) ? therefore : can the correlation numbers such as p ( a↑ ) ( b « ) ( c ◊ ) ( a x , b x , c x ) , be expressed as a product of such independent functions , a ( a x , λ ) , b ( b x , λ ) and c ( c x , λ ) , for all trials and all settings , with a suitable hidden variable value λ ? comparison with the product which defined p ( a↑ ) ( b « ) ( c ◊ ) ( j ) explicitly above , readily suggests to identify λ → j , a ( a x , j ) → ( n j ( a↑ ) − n j ( a↓ ) ) , b ( b x , j ) → ( n j ( b « ) − n j ( b » ) ) , and c ( c x , j ) → ( n j ( c ◊ ) − n j ( c ♦ ) ) , where j denotes any one trial which is characterized by the specific settings a x , b x , and c x , of a , b , and of c , respectively however , ghz and collaborators also require that the hidden variable argument to functions a ( ) , b ( ) , and c ( ) may take the same value , λ , even in distinct trials , being characterized by distinct experimental contexts since equations ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) above can not be satisfied simultaneously when the hidden variable , λ , takes the same value in each equation , ghsz proceed by allowing λ to take different values in each equation with this assumption , p ( λ 1 ) can be determined by choosing the apparatus settings a 2 , b 2 , and c 2 , counting the number of triples for which the outcome is -1 , and dividing by the total number of triples observed at that setting
