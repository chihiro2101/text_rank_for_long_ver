the appalachian region was a passive plate margin , not unlike today 's atlantic coastal plain province the once quiet appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate , the iapetus , collided with and began sinking beneath the north american craton this was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the appalachians the massive bulk of pangea was completed near the end of the paleozoic era ( permian period ) when africa ( gondwana ) plowed into the continental agglomeration , with the appalachian-ouachita mountains near the core other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core , carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures the appalachian mountains span across five geologic provinces ( as defined by the usgs ) : the appalachian basin , the blue ridge mountains , the piedmont province , the adirondack province , and the new england province the discovery well opened a prolific trend of oil and gas fields , producing from upper devonian , mississippian , and pennsylvanian sandstone reservoirs , that extends from southern new york , across western pennsylvania , central west virginia , and eastern ohio , to eastern kentucky a second major trend of oil and gas production in the appalachian basin began with the discovery in 1885 of oil and gas in lower silurian clinton sandstone reservoirs in knox county , ohio another drilling boom in the appalachian basin occurred in the 1960s in morrow county , ohio , where oil was discovered in the upper cambrian part of the knox dolomite along its western margin , the blue ridge is thrust over the folded and faulted margin of the appalachian basin , so that a broad segment of paleozoic strata extends eastward for tens of miles , buried beneath these subhorizontal crystalline thrust sheets at the surface , the blue ridge consists of a mountainous to hilly region , the main component of which are the blue ridge mountains that extend from georgia to pennsylvania the province is bounded on the north and west by the paleozoic strata of the appalachian basin province and on the south by cretaceous and younger sedimentary rocks of the gulf coastal plain
