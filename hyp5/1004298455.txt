with thomas 's help , de havilland took modest premises at the nearby stag lane aerodrome and formed a limited liability company , de havilland aircraft company limited , incorporated 26 september 1920 they survived until 1925 when de havilland 's own design , the moth ( first flown 22 february 1925 ) proved to be just what the flying world was waiting for in 1928 , de havilland aircraft company limited went public initially de havilland concentrated on single and two-seat biplanes , continuing the dh line of aircraft built by airco but adapting them for airline use , but then they introduced a series of smaller aircraft powered by de havilland 's own gipsy engines these aircraft set many aviation records , many piloted by de havilland himself de havilland continued to produce high-performance aircraft including the twin piston-engined dh 88 comet racer , one of which became famous as the winner of the macrobertson air race from england to australia in 1934 after the second world war de havilland continued with advanced designs in both the military and civil fields , but several public disasters doomed the company as an independent entity the de havilland comet was put into service in 1952 as the eagerly anticipated first commercial jet airliner , twice as fast as previous alternatives and a source of british national pride because of the structural problems of the comet , in 1954 all remaining examples were withdrawn from service , with de havilland launching a major effort to build a new version that would be both larger and stronger de havilland 's final designs became the hawker siddeley trident ( originally the dh.121 ) and the innovative british aerospace 125 , originally the dh.125 it did not enter military service , but became the first stage of europa , a launch vehicle for use in space flight de havilland ( canada ) was eventually incorporated into the bombardier group of companies and the dash eight remains in production with a particular emphasis being placed on its quiet operation in comparison to other aircraft of a similar size the deal , which closed on 3 june 2019 following regulatory approval , brought the entire de havilland canada product line under the same banner for the first time in decades , under a new holding company bearing the original name , de havilland aircraft of canada limited the company moved from melbourne to sydney during 1930 where it acted as an agency for the parent company , with assembly , repair and spares facilities for the company 's popular sporting and airliner types aircraft design and full manufacture by de havilland australia ( dha ) did not take place until the second world war , when the company began production of the dh 82 tiger moth primary trainer at bankstown , nsw the two built served as prototypes for the definitive dh-g2 produced the following year but the need had passed by this time and only six dh-g2s were built the company also began to manufacture the mosquito , with deliveries to the raaf being first made in 1944 licensed production of the de havilland vampire began in 1948 , with the first of 190 built flying in 1949 the engine chosen for the new design was the de havilland gipsy major mk-10 4s in 1959 a boat building division known as de havilland marine was established at the bankstown factory on 6 february 2009 , boeing announced that hawker de havilland aerospace had changed its name to boeing aerostructures australia to meet the demand for tiger moth trainers for the royal new zealand air force and potentially for raf training to be conducted in new zealand , the de havilland ( new zealand ) company limited was established in march 1939 , and work commenced on new zealand 's first aircraft factory at rongotai as well as a prolific aircraft builder , de havilland was also a significant producer of aero engines this went against usual practice : usually engines are designed and produced by a dedicated company though in the uk the bristol aeroplane company had a substantial engine business and armstrong whitworth aircraft was part of the same business as armstrong siddeley after 1935 , both part of the hawker group the successful '' gipsy '' and the later developments such as the gipsy major were successful and popular power units , being used in nearly all of de havilland 's light designs and several aircraft from other manufacturers the de havilland company was also a competitor to rolls-royce and metrovick in the early years of jet engine development employing the services of frank halford then buying out his company they produced the de havilland goblin and de havilland ghost engines for first their jet fighters then the comet a company set up in 1935 for the manufacture of hamilton standard propellers under licence , and which later produced guided and other missiles such as the firestreak and blue streak
