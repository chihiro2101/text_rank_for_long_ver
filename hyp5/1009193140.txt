the mouth is wide , with both upper and lower jaws having many small teeth burbot have two soft dorsal fins , with the first being low and short , and the second being much longer having such small fins relative to body size indicates a benthic lifestyle with low swimming endurance , unable to withstand strong currents burbot are most common in streams and lakes of north america and europe they are fairly common in lake erie , but are also found in the other great lakes record burbot comes from lake michigan waters ( december 10 , 2020 ) chicago sun times recent genetic analysis suggests the geographic pattern of burbot may indicate multiple species or subspecies , making this single taxon somewhat misleading the burbot may still survive in the uk spawning season typically occurs between december and march , often under ice at extremely low temperatures ranging between 1 and 4Â°c when spawning , many male burbot gather around one or two females , forming a spawning ball rate of growth , longevity , and age of sexual maturity of burbot are strongly correlated with water temperature ; large , older individuals produce more eggs than small , younger individuals burbot transition from pelagic habitats to benthic environments as they reach adulthood , around five years old burbot at the larval stage and into the juvenile stage feed on invertebrates based on size the burbot is a tenacious predator , which sometimes attacks other fish of almost the same size , and as such , can be a nuisance fish in waters where it is not native recent discoveries of burbot in the green river at flaming gorge reservoir in utah have concerned wildlife biologists , who fear the burbot could decimate the sport-fish population in what is recognized as one of the world 's top brown trout fisheries , because it often feeds on the eggs of other fish in the lake , such as sockeye salmon burbot populations are difficult to study , due to their deep habitats and reproduction under ice
