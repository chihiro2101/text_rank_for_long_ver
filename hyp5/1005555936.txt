however , along with similar bacterial species that can colonize and act symbiotically , they can cause disease if they begin to take over the tissues they have colonized or invade other tissues ; the resultant infection has been called a '' pathobiont '' after 72 hours , mrsa can take hold in human tissues and eventually become resistant to treatment about 75 percent of ca-mrsa infections are localized to skin and soft tissue and usually can be treated effectively a select few of the populations at risk include : people with indwelling implants , prostheses , drains , and catheters people who are frequently in crowded places , especially with shared equipment and skin-to-skin contact people with weak immune systems ( hiv/aids , lupus , or cancer sufferers ; transplant recipients ; severe asthmatics ; etc people who are hospitalized , including the elderly , are often immunocompromised and susceptible to infection of all kinds , including mrsa ; an infection by mrsa is called healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant s generally , those infected by mrsa stay infected for just under 10 days , if treated by a doctor , although effects may vary from person to person surgical site infections occur on the skin surface , but can spread to internal organs and blood to cause sepsis antibiotic use in livestock increases the risk that mrsa will develop among the livestock ; strains mrsa st 398 and cc398 are transmissible to humans mrsa is becoming a critical problem in children ; studies found 4.6 % of patients in u.s needle-required drugs have caused an increase of mrsa , with injection drug use ( idu ) making up 24.1 % ( 1,839 individuals ) of tennessee hospital 's discharge system the unsanitary methods of injection causes an access point for the mrsa to enter the blood stream and begin infecting the host furthermore , with mrsa 's high contagion rate , a common risk factor is individuals who are in constant contact with someone who has injected drugs in the past year a defining characteristic of mrsa is its ability to thrive in the presence of penicillin-like antibiotics , which normally prevent bacterial growth by inhibiting synthesis of cell wall material sccmec contains additional genes beyond meca , including the cytolysin gene psm-mec , which may suppress virulence in ha-acquired mrsa strains owing to the size of the sccmec element and the constraints of horizontal gene transfer , a minimum of five clones are thought to be responsible for the spread of mrsa infections , with clonal complex ( cc ) 8 most prevalent mrsa is able to thrive in hospital settings with increased antibiotic resistance but decreased virulence – ha-mrsa targets immunocompromised , hospitalized hosts , thus a decrease in virulence is not maladaptive in contrast , ca-mrsa tends to carry lower-fitness cost sccmec elements to offset the increased virulence and toxicity expression required to infect healthy hosts emrsa16 has been found to be identical to the st36 : usa200 strain , which circulates in the united states , and to carry the sccmec type ii , enterotoxin a and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 genes under the new international typing system , this strain is now called mrsa252 emrsa 15 is also found to be one of the common mrsa strains in asia community-acquired mrsa ( ca-mrsa ) strains emerged in late 1990 to 2000 , infecting healthy people who had not been in contact with healthcare facilities in taiwan , st59 strains , some of which are resistant to many non-beta-lactam antibiotics , have arisen as common causes of skin and soft tissue infections in the community , usa300 was found only rarely in a study of mrsa strains from outbreaks in 1996 and 2000 as well as in surveillance from 2004–06 still , because no quick and easy method exists to diagnose mrsa , initial treatment of the infection is often based upon '' strong suspicion '' and techniques by the treating physician ; these include quantitative pcr procedures , which are employed in clinical laboratories for quickly detecting and identifying mrsa strains the meca gene , which confers resistance to a number of antibiotics , is always present in mrsa and usually absent in mssa ; however , in some instances , the meca gene is present in mssa but is not expressed specialized culture media have been developed to better differentiate between mssa and mrsa and , in some cases , such media can be used to identify specific strains that are resistant to different antibiotics one strain is only partially susceptible to vancomycin and is called vancomycin-intermediate s in health-care settings , isolating those with mrsa from those without the infection is one method to prevent transmission the centers for disease control and prevention offers suggestions for preventing the contraction and spread of mrsa infection which are applicable to those in community settings , including incarcerated populations , childcare center employees , and athletes workers with active infections are excluded from activities where skin-to-skin contact is likely to occur mathematical models describe one way in which a loss of infection control can occur after measures for screening and isolation seem to be effective for years , as happened in the uk in the '' search and destroy '' strategy that was employed by all uk hospitals until the mid-1990s , all hospitalized people with mrsa were immediately isolated , and all staff were screened for mrsa and were prevented from working until they had completed a course of eradication therapy that was proven to work as of 2013 , whether strategies to eradicate mrsa colonization of people in nursing homes reduced infection rates was not known care should be taken when trying to drain boils , as disruption of surrounding tissue can lead to larger infections , including sepsis the world health organization advocates regulations on the use of antibiotics in animal feed to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant strains of mrsa the location and history related to the infection determines the treatment antibiotics effective against mrsa can be given by iv , oral , or a combination of both , and depend on the specific circumstances and patient characteristics mrsa can be eradicated with a regimen of linezolid , though treatment protocols vary and serum levels of antibiotics vary widely from person to person and may affect outcomes the effective treatment of mrsa with linezolid has been successful in 87 % of people ceftaroline , a fifth-generation cephalosporin , is the first beta-lactam antibiotic approved in the us to treat mrsa infections in skin and soft tissue or community-acquired pneumonia treatment of mrsa infection with vancomycin can be complicated , due to its inconvenient route of administration several newly discovered strains of mrsa show antibiotic resistance even to vancomycin and teicoplanin more information is needed to determine the effectiveness of specific antibiotics therapy in surgical site infections ( ssis ) in surgical wounds , evidence is weak ( high risk of bias ) that linezolid may be better than vancomycin to eradicate mrsa ssis in skin infections and secondary infection sites , topical mupirocin is used successfully clindamycin is not approved for the treatment of mrsa infection , but it is still used in children for soft-tissue infections appropriate antibiotic therapy may be administered for up to six weeks four to six weeks of antibiotic treatment is often recommended , and is dependent upon the extent of mrsa infection there is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical or systematic antibiotics for nasal or extra-nasal mrsa infection in cases of a recent placement of a surgical implant or artificial joint , the device may be retained while antibiotic therapy continues treatment is not standardized for other instances of mrsa infection in a wide range of tissues many of these infections are less serious , but the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) estimate that there are 80,461 invasive mrsa infections and 11,285 deaths due to mrsa annually infection after surgery is relatively uncommon , but occurs as much as 33 % in specific types of surgeries mrsa sepsis that occurs within 30 days following a surgical infection has a 15–38 % mortality rate ; mrsa sepsis that occurs within one year has a mortality rate of around 55 % communities showed the annual incidence of ca-mrsa during 2001–2002 to be 18–25.7/100,000 ; most ca-mrsa isolates were associated with clinically relevant infections , and 23 % of people required hospitalization there are concerns that the presence of mrsa in the environment may allow resistance to be transferred to other bacteria through phages ( viruses that infect bacteria ) in 1961 , the first known mrsa isolates were reported in a british study , and from 1961 to 1967 , infrequent hospital outbreaks occurred in western europe and australia , with methicillin then being licensed in england to treat resistant infections several studies , however , including one by blot and colleagues , that have adjusted for underlying disease still found mrsa bacteremia to have a higher attributable mortality than methicillin-susceptible s a population-based study of the incidence of mrsa infections in san francisco during 2004–05 demonstrated that nearly one in 300 residents suffered from such an infection in the course of a year and that greater than 85 % of these infections occurred outside of the healthcare setting incidence of mrsa central line-associated blood-stream infections as reported by hundreds of intensive care units decreased 50–70 % from 2001–2007 a separate system tracking all hospital mrsa bloodstream infections found an overall 34 % decrease between 2005 and 2008 a report on skin and soft-tissue infections in the cook county jail in chicago in 2004–05 demonstrated mrsa was the most common cause of these infections among those incarcerated there the delivery of inhaled antibiotics along with systematic administration to treat mrsa are being developed phage therapy has been used for years in mrsa in eastern countries , and studies are ongoing in western countries
