standard analog television signals go through several processing steps on their way to being broadcast , each of which discards information and lowers the quality of the resulting images the first of these signals is called y , which is created from all three original signals based on a formula that produces an overall brightness of the image , or luma this signal closely matches a traditional black and white television signal and the y/c method of encoding was key to offering backward compatibility a signal with three components is no easier to broadcast than the original three-signal rgb , so additional processing is required this signal contains two color-difference components carrying the color information as one signal means that the color has to be encoded in some way , typically in accord with ntsc , pal , or secam , depending on the applicable local standard the commodore 64 released in 1982 ( with the exception of the earliest revisions using a 5-pin video port ) also offers separate chroma and luma signals using a different connector although commodore business machines did not use the term '' s-video '' as the standard did not formally exist until 1987 , a simple adapter connects the computer 's '' lca '' ( luma-chroma-audio ) 8-pin din socket to a s-video display , or an s-video device to the commodore 1702 monitor 's lca jacks these plugs are usually made to be plug-compatible with s-video , and include optional features , such as component video using an adapter the three extra sockets may be used to supply composite video , an rgb or ypbpr video signal , or an iÂ²c interface image : pseudo minidin-9 diagram.png 65px 9-pin connectors are used in graphics systems that feature the ability to input video as well as output it as can be seen from the diagram above , although the s-video signals are available on the corresponding pins , neither variant of the connector will accept an unmodified 4-pin s-video plug , though they can be made to fit by removing the key from the plug
