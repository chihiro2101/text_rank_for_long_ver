thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected ( arterial or venous thrombosis ) and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it jugular vein thrombosis is a condition that may occur due to infection , intravenous drug use or malignancy staphyloccoal or streptococcal infections of the face , for example nasal or upper lip pustules may thus spread directly into the cavernous sinus , causing stroke-like symptoms of double vision , squint , as well as spread of infection to cause meningitis the most common cause is atrial fibrillation , which causes a blood stasis within the atria with easy thrombus formation , but blood clots can develop inside the heart for other reasons too a stroke is the rapid decline of brain function due to a disturbance in the supply of blood to the brain this restriction gives an insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle which then results in tissue death ( infarction ) '' virchow 's triad '' has been suggested to describe the three factors necessary for the formation of thrombosis : stasis of blood , vessel wall injury , and altered blood coagulation the main causes of thrombosis are given in virchow 's triad which lists thrombophilia , endothelial cell injury , and disturbed blood flow any inflammatory process , such as trauma , surgery or infection , can cause damage to the endothelium of the vessel 's wall the main mechanism is exposure of tissue factor to the blood coagulation system endothelial injury is almost invariably involved in the formation of thrombi in arteries , as high rates of blood flow normally hinder clot formation in addition , arterial and cardiac clots are normally rich in plateletsâ€“which are required for clot formation in areas under high stress due to blood flow cancers or malignancies such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by possible activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances ( paraneoplastic syndrome ) , by external compression on a blood vessel when a solid tumor is present , or ( more rarely ) extension into the vasculature ( for example , renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins ) there are scores that correlate different aspects of patient data ( comorbidities , vital signs , and others ) to risk of thrombosis , such as the pompe-c , which stratifies risk of mortality due to pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer , who typically have higher rates of thrombosis ischemia/infarction : if an arterial thrombus can not be lysed by the body and it does not embolise , and if the thrombus is large enough to impair or occlude blood flow in the involved artery , then local ischemia or infarction will result a venous thrombus may or may not be ischemic , since veins distribute deoxygenated blood that is less vital for cellular metabolism a thrombus may become detached and enter circulation as an embolus , finally lodging in and completely obstructing a blood vessel , which unless treated very quickly will lead to tissue necrosis ( an infarction ) in the area past the occlusion in people with a '' shunt '' ( a connection between the pulmonary and systemic circulation ) , either in the heart or in the lung , a venous clot can also end up in the arteries and cause arterial embolism this can affect any organ ; for instance , arterial embolism of the brain is one of the cause of stroke the treatment for thrombosis depends on whether it is in a vein or an artery , the impact on the person , and the risk of complications from treatment this carries an increased risk of bleeding so is generally only used for specific situations ( such as severe stroke or a massive pulmonary embolism ) arterial thrombosis may require surgery if it causes acute limb ischemia
