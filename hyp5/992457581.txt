john hobson , a geneticist involved in a project concerned with manipulating dna , awakes in his hotel room in thames , new zealand , after a nightmare of falling from a great height upon getting up he finds the electricity off hobson checks the time in his car , finding the vehicle 's clock is also frozen at 6:12 hobson concludes that some force has altered the clocks to show the same time and then stopped them , suggesting an intelligence behind the event , which hobson dubs '' the effect '' uncertainty as to whether the presence was there , or whether it may have been a stray animal spared from the effect competes in his mind with speculations that the intruder could be a manifestation of the effect trying to work around the stalled vehicle , he is confronted by another survivor with a rifle he remained at his post for two days before setting out to find survivors believing it to be a car , api laid the roadblock to catch anyone coming south it is present only in certain places , and is stronger at night the two men seem to already know one other , sharing a flash of recognition upon first meeting neither can account for this , as they have never encountered each other before hobson plans to run tests to see if he can determine the nature of the effect and the reason why he and api survived there is a moment of hostility when api breaks free , resolved when hobson explains that his son , who was autistic , drowned in a bathtub , and hobson felt api was making fun of this three weeks after the effect , hobson is left alone while api goes to get a new car he speculates that the force may have always been a part of the land , and is claiming the earth breaking open perrin 's box , hobson realises his colleagues considered him unbalanced and kept him under surveillance in a later flashback , hobson relates how he sabotaged the sound wave machine before going on leave to output a much higher level of infrasound than the controls would register the idea was to put the machine out of action temporarily , ruining perrin 's chance to use hobson 's theories as he reads perrin 's notes , hobson realises that this sabotage almost certainly caused the effect allowing his child to die was his way of destroying himself , a kind of external suicide perhaps the rest of humanity evolved , or is unchanged and wondering where hobson and a handful of others have gone to
