a dna transcription unit encoding for a protein may contain both a coding sequence , which will be translated into the protein , and regulatory sequences , which direct and regulate the synthesis of that protein as opposed to dna replication , transcription results in an rna complement that includes the nucleotide uracil ( u ) in all instances where thymine ( t ) would have occurred in a dna complement this also removes the need for an rna primer to initiate rna synthesis , as is the case in dna replication the non-template ( sense ) strand of dna is called the coding strand , because its sequence is the same as the newly created rna transcript ( except for the substitution of uracil for thymine ) as a result , transcription has a lower copying fidelity than dna replication transcription begins with the binding of rna polymerase , together with one or more transcription factor , to a specific dna sequence referred to as a '' promoter '' to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' closed complex '' rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then unwinds approximately 14 base pairs of dna to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' open complex '' '' rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then selects a transcription start site in the transcription bubble , binds to an initiating ntp and an extending ntp ( or a short rna primer and an extending ntp ) complementary to the transcription start site sequence , and catalyzes bond formation to yield an initial rna product abortive initiation continues to occur until an rna product of a threshold length of approximately 10 nucleotides is synthesized , at which point promoter escape occurs and a transcription elongation complex is formed although rna polymerase traverses the template strand from 3 ' → 5 ' , the coding ( non-template ) strand and newly formed rna can also be used as reference points , so transcription can be described as occurring 5 ' → 3 ' mrna transcription can involve multiple rna polymerases on a single dna template and multiple rounds of transcription ( amplification of particular mrna ) , so many mrna molecules can be rapidly produced from a single copy of a gene in eukaryotes , this may correspond with short pauses during transcription that allow appropriate rna editing factors to bind these pauses may be intrinsic to the rna polymerase or due to chromatin structure in rho-independent transcription termination , rna transcription stops when the newly synthesized rna molecule forms a g-c-rich hairpin loop followed by a run of us in the '' rho-dependent '' type of termination , a protein factor called '' rho '' destabilizes the interaction between the template and the mrna , thus releasing the newly synthesized mrna from the elongation complex potent , bioactive natural products like triptolide that inhibit mammalian transcription via inhibition of the xpb subunit of the general transcription factor tfiih has been recently reported as a glucose conjugate for targeting hypoxic cancer cells with increased glucose transporter expression rna synthesis by rna polymerase was established in vitro by several laboratories by 1965 ; however , the rna synthesized by these enzymes had properties that suggested the existence of an additional factor needed to terminate transcription correctly transcription can be measured and detected in a variety of ways : g-less cassette transcription assay : measures promoter strength run-off transcription assay : identifies transcription start sites ( tss ) nuclear run-on assay : measures the relative abundance of newly formed transcripts kas-seq : measures single-stranded dna generated by rna polymerases ; can work with 1,000 cells rnase protection assay and chip-chip of rnap : detect active transcription sites rt-pcr : measures the absolute abundance of total or nuclear rna levels , which may however differ from transcription rates dna microarrays : measures the relative abundance of the global total or nuclear rna levels ; however , these may differ from transcription rates in situ hybridization : detects the presence of a transcript ms2 tagging : by incorporating rna stem-loop , such as ms2 , into a gene , these become incorporated into newly synthesized rna northern blot : the traditional method , and until the advent of rna-seq , the most quantitative rna-seq : applies next-generation sequencing techniques to sequence whole transcriptomes , which allows the measurement of relative abundance of rna , as well as the detection of additional variations such as fusion genes , post-transcriptional edits and novel splice sites single cell rna-seq : amplifies and reads partial transcriptomes from isolated cells , allowing for detailed analyses of rna in tissues , embryos , and cancers the main enzyme responsible for synthesis of dna from an rna template is called reverse transcriptase some eukaryotic cells contain an enzyme with reverse transcription activity called telomerase
