the “ active factor ” that the hormones produced was finally purified in 1958 , and then identified as containing a ribose , a phosphate , and an adenine in equal ratios while all nucleotides have this structure , the phosphate group makes a second connection to the ribose ring at the 3 ’ carbon in cyclic nucleotides control of intracellular concentrations is maintained through a series of enzymatic reactions involving several families of proteins adenylyl cyclase has been found in both a transmembrane and cytosolic form , representing distinct protein classes and different sources of camp degradation is carried out primarily by a class of enzymes known as phosphodiesterases ( pdes ) in mammalian cells , there are 11 known pde families with varying isoforms of each protein expressed based on the cell 's regulatory needs cyclic nucleotides can be found in many different types of eukaryotic cells , including photo-receptor rods and cones , smooth muscle cells and liver cells cellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides can be very low , in the 10 −7 m range , because metabolism and function are often localized in particular parts of the cell a highly conserved cyclic nucleotide-binding domain ( cnb ) is present in all proteins that bind cnmps , regardless of their biological function there is also data to support a synergistic binding effect amongst multiple cyclic nucleotides , with ccmp lowering the effective concentration ( ec 50 ) of camp for activation of protein kinase a ( pka ) cyclic nucleotides are integral to a communication system that acts within cells cyclic nucleotides act as second messengers when first messengers , which can not enter the cell , instead bind to receptors in the cellular membrane the involvement of cyclic nucleotides on biological functions is varied , while an understanding of their role continues to grow in bacteria , cyclic nucleotides bind to catabolite gene activator protein ( cap ) , which acts to increase metabolic enzymatic activity by increasing the rate of dna transcription
