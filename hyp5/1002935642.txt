cupronickel alloys are used for marine applications marine applications for copper-nickel alloys due to their resistance to seawater corrosion , good fabricability , and their effectiveness in lowering macrofouling levels in part due to silver hoarding in the civil war , the united states mint first used cupronickel for circulating coinage in three-cent pieces starting in 1865 , and then for five-cent pieces starting in 1866 cryogenic properties of copper-nickel properties of copper and copper alloys properties of copper and copper alloys at low temperatures beginning around the turn of the 20th century , bullet jackets were commonly made from this material since cupronickel is much softer than steel , it bends and flares more easily , and the same property allows it to form a better seal with hydraulic components copper-nickels naturally form a thin protective surface layer over the first several weeks of exposure to seawater and this provides its ongoing resistance ferrous sulfate dosing to sea water systems can provide improved resistance the 70–30 rather than 90–10 weld consumables are normally preferred for both alloys and no after-welding heat treatment is required they can also be welded directly to steel , providing a 65 % nickel-copper weld consumable is used to avoid iron dilution effects applications for cu–ni alloys have withstood the test of time , as they are still widely used and range from seawater system piping , condensers and heat exchangers in naval vessels , commercial shipping , multiple-stage flash desalination and power stations copper-nickel standards thermocouples and resistors whose resistance is stable across changes in temperature contain alloy constantan , which consists of 55 % copper and 45 % nickel cupronickel alloys were known as '' white copper '' to the china since about the third century bc the paktong alloy was described as being made by adding small pills of naturally occurring yunnan ore to a bath of molten copper the ore used is noted as solely available from yunnan , according to the story : '' san mao chun were at tanyang during a famine year when many people died , so taking certain chemicals , ying projected them onto silver , turning it into gold , and he also transmuted iron into silver & nbsp ; – thus enabling the lives of many to be saved through purchasing grain through this fake silver and gold thereafter all those who prepared chemical powders by heating and transmuting copper by projection called their methods '' tanyang techniques '' most likely , modern paktong was unknown to chinese of the day & nbsp ; – but the naturally occurring yunnan ore cupronickel alloy was likely a valuable internal trade commodity in 1973 , cheng and schwitter in their new analyses suggested that the bactrian alloys ( copper , lead , iron , nickel and cobalt ) were closely similar to the chinese paktong , and of nine known asian nickel deposits , only those in china could provide the identical chemical compositions if the bactrian nickel theory were true , according to cammann , the silk road would have increased the supply of cupronickel , he noted the chinese of his day did not form it as an alloy but rather smelted readily available unprocessed ore : '' appeared from a vast series of experiments made at peking- that it occurred naturally as an ore mined at the region , the most extraordinary copper is pe-tong or white copper : it is white when dug out of the mine and even more white within than without it appears , by a vast number of experiments made at peking , that its colour is owing to no mixture ; on the contrary , all mixtures diminish its beauty , for , when it is rightly managed it looks exactly like silver and were there not a necessity of mixing a little tutenag or such metal to soften it , it would be so much more the extraordinary as this sort of copper is found no where but in china and that only in the province of yunnan '' notwithstanding what is here said , of the colour of the copper being owing to no mixture , it is certain the chinese white copper as brought to us , is a mixt sic : mixed metal ; so that the ore from which it was extracted must consist of various metallic substances ; and from such ore that the natural orichalcum if it ever existed , was made efforts in europe to exactly duplicate the chinese paktong failed due to a general lack of requisite complex cobalt-nickel-arsenic naturally occurring ore however , the schneeberg district of germany , where the famous blaufarbenwerke made cobalt blue and other pigments , solely held the requisite complex cobalt-nickel-arsenic ores in europe ew benson , devised greatly improved methods of cobalt and nickel suspension and marketed their own brand of nickel-silver , called '' british plate '' soon afterwards , a 2 % manganese and 2 % iron alloy now known as alloy c71640 was introduced for a uk power station which needed better erosion resistance because the levels of entrained sand in the seawater a 90–10 alloy first became available in the 1950s , initially for seawater piping , and is now the more widely used alloy copper-nickel alloys copper-nickel-alloys : properties , processing , applications ( source : german copper institute ( dki ) ) ] copper-nickel alloys for seawater corrosion resistance and antifouling - a state of the art review ( c.a
