by placing a miniature model of a dinosaur close to the camera , the director may make the dinosaur look monstrously tall to the viewer , even though it is just closer to the camera early instances of forced perspective used in low-budget motion pictures showed objects that were clearly different from their surroundings : often blurred or at a different light level this means that a light source must be four times as bright to produce the same illuminance at an object twice as far away thus to create the illusion of a distant object being at the same distance as a near object and scaled accordingly , much more light is required since miniature models would need to be subjected to far greater lighting than the main focus of the camera , the area of action , it is important to ensure that these can withstand the significant amount of heat generated by the incandescent light sources typically used in film and tv production if the camera 's point of view were moved , then parallax would reveal the true relative positions of the characters in space an extensively used technique in the lord of the rings : the fellowship of the ring was an enhancement of this principle , which could be used in moving shots portions of sets were mounted on movable platforms which would move precisely according to the movement of the camera , so that the optical illusion would be preserved at all times for the duration of the shot props around harry and his friends are of normal size , while seemingly identical props placed around hagrid are in fact smaller an example used for comic effect can be found in the slapstick comedy top secret ! in a scene which appears to begin as a close-up of a ringing phone with the characters in the distance in the television version , larger than life props are used to make the caricatured waterman look just three feet tall or less when forced perspective is supposed to make an object appear farther away , the following method can be used : by constantly decreasing the scale of objects from expectancy and convention toward the farthest point from the spectator , an illusion is created that the scale of said objects is decreasing due to their distant location in contrast , the opposite technique was sometimes used in classical garden designs and other folly to shorten the perceived distances of points of interest along a path this caused a difficulty for special effects technicians working on the movie ghostbusters ii , who had to back off on the amount of forced perspective used when replicating the statue for the movie so that their model ( which was photographed head-on ) would not look top-heavy a perceptive illusion that may be infused in film culture is the idea of gestalt psychology , which holds that people often view the whole of an object as opposed to the sum of its individual parts making two objects at different distances have the same shading gives the impression that they are in similar positions relative to the light source ; therefore , they appear closer to each other than they actually are once the audience becomes acquainted with the size of an object in proportion to the rest of the objects in a scene , the photographer or filmmaker can replace the object with a larger or smaller replica to change another part of the scene 's apparent size for example , to aid in the appearance of a person as a giant next to a '' regular sized '' person , a filmmaker might have a shot of two identical glasses together , then follow with the person who is supposed to play the giant holding a much smaller replica of the glass and the person who is playing the regular-sized person holding a much larger replica because the audience sees that the glasses are the same size in the original shot , the difference in relation to the two characters allows the audience to perceive the characters as different sizes based on their relative size to the glasses they hold this monocular cue takes advantage of the trend for the color of distant objects to shift towards the blue end of the spectrum , while the colors of closer objects shift toward the red end of the spectrum in his painting entitled still life with a curtain , paul c√©zanne creates the illusion of depth by using brighter colors on objects closer to the viewer and dimmer colors and shading to distance the '' light source '' from objects that he wanted to appear farther away typically , these displays use a tilted plane to represent what would otherwise be a level surface , incorporate a painted background of distant objects , and often employ false perspective , carefully modifying the scale of objects placed on the plane to reinforce the illusion through depth perception in which objects of identical real-world size placed farther from the observer appear smaller than those closer all of these techniques are means of presenting a realistic view of a large scene in a compact space forced perspective is extensively employed at theme parks and other such architecture as found in disneyland and las vegas , often to make structures seem larger than they are in reality where physically larger structures would not be feasible or desirable , or to otherwise provide an optical illusion for entertainment value one of the most notable examples of forced perspective being used to make the object appear smaller is the american adventure pavilion in epcot
