” similarly the ijtihād is defined as “ the effort made by the mujtahid in seeking knowledge of the ahkam ( rulings ) of the sharī ‘ ah ( islamic canonical law ) through interpretation as religious law continued to develop over time , ra ' y became insufficient in making sure that fair legal rulings were being derived in keeping with both the qur'an and sunna ijtihad was “ limited to a systematic method of interpreting the law on the basis of authoritative texts , the quran and sunna , ” and the rulings could be “ extended to a new problem as long as the precedent and the new situation shared the same clause mujtahid is defined as a muslim scholar that has met certain requirements including a strong knowledge of the qur'an , sunna , and arabic , as well as a deep understanding of legal theory and the precedent ; all of which allows them to be considered fully qualified to practice ijtihad around the beginning of the 10th century , most sunni jurists argued that all major matters of religious law had been settled , allowing for taqlid ( تقليد ) , '' the established legal precedents and traditions , '' to take priority over ijtihād ( اجتهاد ) this move away from the practice of ijtihād was made by the hanafi and maliki law schools , and the majority of shafiis , but not by hanbalis or a number of prominent shafīʿi jurists who believed that '' true consensus '' ( ijma اجماع ) , apart from that of muhammad 's companions , did not exist '' and that '' the constant continuous existence of mujtahids ( مجتهد ) was a theological requirement during the turn of the 16th to 17th century , sunni muslim reformers began to criticize taqlid , and promoted greater use of ijtihad in legal matters they claimed that instead of looking solely to previous generations for practices developed by religious scholars , there should be an established doctrine and rule of behavior through the interpretation of original foundational texts of islam—the qur'an and sunna they emphasized the use of ijtihad , but in contrast to its original use , they sought to '' apply contemporary intellectual methods '' such as academic or scientific thought '' to the task of reforming islam '' al-afghani proposed the new use of ijtihad that he believed would enable muslims to think critically and apply their own individual interpretations of the innovations of modernity in the context of islam sunni muslims , therefore , began to practice ijtihad primarily through the use of personal opinion , or ra ' y as muslims turned to the quran and sunnah to solve their legal issues , they began to recognize that these divine proponents did not deal adequately with certain topics of law therefore , sunni muslims began to find other ways and sources for ijtihad such as ra ' y , which allowed for personal judgment of islamic law sunni muslims justified this practice of ra ' y with a particular hadith , which cites muhammad 's approval of forming an individual sound legal opinion if the qur'an and sunnah contain no explicit text regarding that particular issue should be able to fully understand the objectives of the sharia and be dedicated to the protection of the five principles of islam , which are life , religion , intellect , lineage , and property from the declaration of these requirements of mujtahid onwards , legal scholars adopted these characteristics as being standard for anyone looking to practice ijtihad however , with this introduction of common laws for each madhhab , legal scholars began to dismiss the practice of independent ijtihad and instead maintained the title of mujtahid only for the founders of the four main schools of islamic law ( hanafiyya , malikiyya , shafiyya , hanbaliyya ) therefore , from the 12th century onwards jurists could occupy the position of a mujtahid or access ijtihad in only two cases , when distinguishing between the manifest and the obscure views of their particular schools or when they served as '' imitators '' of mujtahids , expressing the views of the more qualified mujtahids before them following the death of the prophet and once they had determined the imam as absent , ijtihad evolved into a practice of applying careful reason in order to uncover the knowledge of what imams would have done in particular legal situations in order to produce perceptive mujtahids that could fulfill this important role , principles of shia jurisprudence were developed to provide a foundation for scholarly deduction of islamic law these rules allowed mujtahids to issue adjudications on any subject , that could be derived through this process of ijtihad , demonstrating their great responsibility to the shia community furthermore , according to shia islamic jurisprudence a believer of islam is either a mujtahid ( one that expresses their own legal reasoning ) , or a muqallid ( one performing taqlid of a mujtahid ) and a muhtat ( one who acts with precaution ) not only did shia muslims require : knowledge of the texts of the qur'an and sunnah justice in matters of public and personal life utmost piety understanding of the cases where shia mujtahids reached consensus ability to exercise competence and authority however , these scholars also depended on further training that could be received in religious centers called hawza see : mirjam künkler and roja fazaeli , “ the life of two mujtahidas : female religious authority in 20th century iran ” , in women , leadership and mosques : changes in contemporary islamic authority , ed
