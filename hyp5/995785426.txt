in the case of such demise of a tenant-in-chief , the fee reverted to the king 's demesne permanently , when it became once again a mere tenantless plot of land , but could be re-created as a fee by enfeoffment to another of the king 's followers he then granted it out to his favoured followers , who thereby became tenant-in-chief , under various contracts of feudal land tenure such tenures , even the highest one of '' feudal barony '' , never conferred ownership of land but merely ownership of rights over it , that is to say ownership of an estate in land where no legal heir existed , the logic of the situation was that the fief had ceased to exist as a legal entity , since being tenantless no one was living who had been enfeoffed with the land , and the land was thus technically owned by either the crown or the immediate overlord ( where the fee had been subinfeudated by the tenant-in-chief to a mesne lord , and perhaps the process of subinfeudation had been continued by a lower series of mesne-lords ) as ultimus heres escheat could also take place if a tenant was outlawed or convicted of a felony , when the king could exercise the ancient right of wasting the criminal 's land for a year and a day , after which the land would revert to the overlord the commonest mechanism was distraint , also known as distress ( districtio ) , whereby the lord would seize chattels or goods belonging to the tenant , to hold until performance was achieved & nbsp ; 355â€“366 , cambridge university press , 1968 thus , under english common law , there were two main ways an escheat could happen : a person 's lands escheated to the immediate overlord if he was convicted of a felony ( but not treason , in that event the land was forfeited to the crown ) if a person had no heir to receive his lands under his will , or under the laws of intestacy , then any land he owned at death would escheat thus it would be revealed whether the king had any rights to the land if there was any doubt , the escheator would seize the land and refer the case to the king 's court where it would be settled , ensuring that not one day 's revenue would be lost in england and wales , the possibility of escheat of a deceased person 's property to the feudal overlord was abolished by the administration of estates act 1925 ; however , the concept of bona vacantia means that the crown ( or duchy of cornwall or duchy of lancaster ) can still receive such property if no one else can be found who is eligible to inherit it the term is often now applied to the transfer of the title to a person 's property to the state when the person dies intestate without any other person capable of taking the property as heir usually this means that all the property held by that person is 'vested in ' ( transferred to ) the official receiver or trustee in bankruptcy however , usually , in the example given above , the tenants of the flats , or their mortgagees would exercise their rights given by the insolvency act 1986 to have the freehold property transferred to them the legal principle behind escheatment is that all property has a legally recognized owner ; therefore , if the original owner can not be found within a specified time , government is presumed to be the owner
