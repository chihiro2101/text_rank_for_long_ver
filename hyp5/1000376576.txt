substitution of pyrrole with alkyl substituents provides a more basic molecule—for example , tetramethylpyrrole has a conjugate acid pk a of +3.7 as a hydrogen bonding lewis acid it is classified as a hsab and the ecw model lists its acid parameters as e a 1.38 and c a 0.68 pyrrole is prepared industrially by treatment of furan with ammonia in the presence of solid acid catalysts , like silica and alumina the method involves the reaction of an α-aminoketone ( 1 ) and a compound containing a methylene group α to ( bonded to the next carbon to ) a carbonyl group ( 2 ) in the paal–knorr pyrrole synthesis , a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or a primary amine to form a substituted pyrrole addition of hydrochloric acid leads to ring closure and loss of ammonia to form the pyrrole examples of disubstituted alkynes have also been seen to form the desired pyrrole in considerable yield ala dehydratase catalyzes the condensation of two ala molecules via a knorr-type ring synthesis to form porphobilinogen ( pbg ) this later reacts to form , for example , the macrocycles heme and chlorophyll . proline can be used as precursor of aromatic pyrroles in secondary natural products , as in prodigiosins the biosynthesis of prodigiosin involves the convergent coupling of three pyrrole type rings ( labeled a , b , and c in figure 1 ) from l-proline , l-serine , l-methionine , pyruvate , and 2-octenal this fragment is then able to react with the masked carbanion formed from the plp mediated decarboxylation of l-serine , which cyclizes in a dehydration reaction to yield the second pyrrole ring this intermediate is then modified by methylation ( which incorporates a methyl group from l-methionine onto the alcohol at the 6 position ) and oxidation of the primary alcohol to the aldehyde to yield the core a-b ring structures under acidic conditions , pyrroles polymerize easily , and thus many electrophile reagents that are used in benzene chemistry are not applicable to pyrroles as is typical for electrophilic additions to pyrroles , halogenation generally occurs at the 2-position , but can also occur at the 3-position by silation of the nitrogen acylation with acid anhydrides and acid chlorides can occur without a catalyst ; alternatively , a lewis acid may be used alkylation to form enones at c2 has been seen for example , birch reduction of pyrrole esters and amides produced pyrrolines , with the regioselectivity depending on the position of the electron-withdrawing group diels-alder cyclizations can occur with the pyrrole acting as a diene , especially in the presence of an electron-withdrawing group on the nitrogen with dichlorocarbene , a dichlorocyclopropane intermediate is formed , which breaks down to form 3-chloropyridine ( the ciamician–dennstedt rearrangement ) structural analogs of pyrrole include : pyrroline , a partially saturated analog with one double bond pyrrolidine , the saturated hydrogenated analog derivatives of pyrrole include indole , a derivative with a fused benzene ring
