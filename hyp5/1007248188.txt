sinkholes may capture surface drainage from running or standing water , but may also form in high and dry places in specific locations occasionally a sinkhole may exhibit a visible opening into a cave below in the case of exceptionally large sinkholes , such as the minyé sinkhole in papua new guinea or cedar sink at mammoth cave national park in kentucky , an underground stream or river may be visible across its bottom flowing from one side to the other these sinkholes can be dramatic , because the surface land usually stays intact until there is not enough support collapses , commonly incorrectly labeled as sinkholes also occur due to human activity , such as the collapse of abandoned mines and salt cavern storage in salt domes in places like louisiana , mississippi and texas more commonly , collapses occur in urban areas due to water main breaks or sewer collapses when old pipes give way some sinkholes form when the land surface is changed , such as when industrial and runoff-storage ponds are created ; the substantial weight of the new material can trigger a collapse of the roof of an existing void or cavity in the subsurface , resulting in development of a sinkhole soil settles down into the enlarged openings forming a small depression at the ground surface new sinkhole collapses can also form when human activity changes the natural water-drainage patterns in karst areas '' human activities can accelerate collapses of karst sinkholes , causing collapse within a few years that would normally evolve over thousands of years under natural conditions flowing water in karst conduits carries the soil away , preventing soil from accumulating in rock cavities and allowing the collapse process to continue the most likely locations for sinkhole collapse are areas where there is already a high density of existing sinkholes where large cavities exist in the limestone large surface collapses can occur , such the winter park , florida sinkhole collapse since the soil/rock surface in karst areas are very irregular the number of subsurface samples ( borings and core samples ) required per unit area is usually much greater than in non-karst areas the largest recent sinkhole in the usa is possibly one that formed in 1972 in montevallo , alabama as a result of man-made lowering of the water level in a nearby rock quarry their formation is facilitated by high groundwater flow , often caused by high rainfall ; such rainfall causes formation of the giant sinkholes in the nakanaï mountains , on the new britain island in papua new guinea powerful underground rivers may form on the contact between limestone and underlying insoluble rock , creating large underground voids on the fringes of the state , sinkholes are rare or non-existent ; limestone there is around 120,000 years old sinkholes that form in coral reefs and islands that collapse to enormous depths are known as blue holes and often become popular diving spots large and visually unusual sinkholes have been well known to local people since ancient times blue holes – this name was initially given to the deep underwater sinkholes of the bahamas but is often used for any deep water-filled pits formed in carbonate rocks the name originates from the deep blue color of water in these sinkholes , which is created by the high clarity of the water and the great depth of the sinkholes ; only the deep blue color of the visible spectrum can penetrate such depth and return after reflection tiankengs – these are extremely large sinkholes , typically deeper and wider than , with mostly vertical walls , most often created by the collapse of caverns the term means sky holes in chinese ; many of this largest type of sinkhole are located in china tomo – this term is used in new zealand karst country to describe pot holes it swallowed a three-story building and a house ; it measured approximately wide and deep instead , they are examples of '' piping pseudokarst '' , created by the collapse of large cavities that had developed in the weak , crumbly quaternary volcanic deposits underlying the city although weak and crumbly , these volcanic deposits have enough cohesion to allow them to stand in vertical faces and to develop large subterranean voids within them eventually , these underground voids became large enough that their roofs collapsed to create large holes it includes an archway leading out to the red sea at , which has been the site for many freediving and scuba attempts , the latter often fatal unusual features are tilted stalactites in great depth , which mark the former orientation of limestone layers when this sinkhole was above sea level at the bottom of an conical pit , and approximately deep , it is among the deepest sinkholes in the world ( see sótano del barro below ) approximately deep pit with nearly vertical walls , contains an approximately deep lake the sinkhole , which is located in an area of karst bedrock , is approximately in diameter and deep with many mature trees growing on the floor of the hole twelve springs , some more visible than others , feed a pond at the bottom in area and deep , a national natural landmark in area , deep and almost perfectly round unique , isolated forest on bottom
