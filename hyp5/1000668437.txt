daily human activities result in deposition of pollutants on roads , lawns , roofs , farm fields , and other land surfaces in natural catchments ( watersheds ) surface runoff entering waterways is a relatively rare event , occurring only a few times each year and generally after larger storm events , roofs and roads ) , ensure that water is efficiently conveyed to waterways through pipe networks , meaning that even small storm events result in increased waterway flows in addition to delivering higher pollutants from the urban catchment , increased stormwater flow can lead to stream erosion , encourage weed invasion , and alter natural flow regimes '' control of toxic chemicals in puget sound , phase 2 : development of simple numerical models '' , 2008 for class v stormwater injection wells '' underground injection control ( uic ) stormwater drainage wells '' the u.s ” in addition to the problem of chemical contaminants in stormwater , this usgs report also identifies problems of physical habitat disturbance that best management practices ( bmps ) do not eliminate , “ some of the most substantial biological changes caused by development are directly or indirectly related to altered hydrology despite efforts to use bmps to attenuate the hydrologic effects of development , increased peak flows and more flashy runoff will cause physical modifications to the channel shape , bed substrate , and banks of receiving waters , with corresponding effects on aquatic habitat and biota loss of forest canopy , increases in paved area , and shallow and ( or ) muddy detention areas also may cause thermal pollution problems , which can exacerbate chemical stressors on aquatic organisms in receiving waters although the number of casualties from urban flooding is usually limited , the economic , social and environmental consequences can be considerable : in addition to direct damage to property and infrastructure ( highways , utilities and services ) , chronically wet houses are linked to an increase in respiratory problems and other illnesses indoor air quality ( iaq ) scientific findings resource bank ( iaq-sfrb ) , '' health risks or dampness or mold in houses '' sewer backups are often from the sanitary sewer system , which takes on some storm water as a result of infiltration/inflow according to the federal emergency management agency almost 40 percent of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster the federally-funded improvement project created a short-term solution by improving the bayou 's drainage capacity , and identified a broad set of potential recreation and open space opportunities along the 35 miles of the bayou and tributaries however , problems occur when the landscape is altered by urban development therefore , land use planning for new development needs to avoid karst areas control of flooding and erosion ; control of hazardous materials to prevent release of pollutants into the environment ( source control ) ; planning and construction of stormwater systems so contaminants are removed before they pollute surface waters or groundwater resources ; acquisition and protection of natural waterways or rehabilitation ; building nature-based solutions such as ponds , swales , constructed wetlands or green infrastructure solutions to work with existing or '' hard '' drainage structures , such as pipes and concrete channels ( constructed wetlands built for stormwater treatment can also serve as habitat for plants , amphibians and fish ) development of funding approaches to stormwater programs potentially including stormwater fee and the creation of a stormwater utility ; development of long-term asset management programs to repair and replace aging infrastructure ; revision of current stormwater regulations to address comprehensive stormwater needs ; enhancement and enforcement of existing ordinances to make sure property owners consider the effects of stormwater before , during and after development of their land ; education of a community about how its actions affect water quality , and about what it can do to improve water quality image:7sigma raingarden 66.jpg thumb rain garden designed to treat stormwater from adjacent parking lot integrated water management ( iwm ) of stormwater has the potential to address many of the issues affecting the health of waterways and water supply challenges facing the modern urban city iwm is often associated with green infrastructure when considered in the design process also known as low impact development ( lid ) in the united states , or water sensitive urban design ( wsud ) in australia , iwm has the potential to improve runoff quality , reduce the risk and impact of flooding and deliver an additional water resource to augment potable supply the development of the modern city often results in increased demands for water supply due to population growth , while at the same time altered runoff predicted by climate change has the potential to increase the volume of stormwater that can contribute to drainage and flooding problems iwm offers several techniques , including stormwater harvest ( to reduce the amount of water that can cause flooding ) , infiltration ( to restore the natural recharge of groundwater ) , biofiltration or bioretention ( e.g , rain gardens ) , to store and treat runoff and release it at a controlled rate to reduce impact on streams and wetland treatments ( to store and control runoff rates and provide habitat in urban areas ) lid can also be achieved by utilizing engineered , manufactured products to achieve similar , or potentially better , results as land-based systems ( underground storage tanks , stormwater treatment systems , biofilters , etc the proper lid solution is one that balances the desired results ( controlling runoff and pollution ) with the associated costs ( loss of usable land for land-based systems versus capital cost of manufactured solution ) much of this impairment is due to polluted runoff , generally in urbanized watersheds ( in other us watersheds , agricultural pollution is a major source ) to address the nationwide problem of stormwater pollution , congress broadened the cwa definition of '' point source '' in 1987 to include industrial stormwater discharges and municipal separate storm sewer systems ( '' ms4 '' ) for example , the state of maryland requires erosion and sediment controls on construction sites of 5,000 sq ft ( 460 m 2 ) or more activities for which approved erosion and sediment control plans are required its outreach activities include a rain barrel distribution program and materials for homeowners on installing rain gardens since humans began living in concentrated village or urban settings , stormwater runoff has been an issue
