each time a new manifestation of god comes it is considered the day of judgment , day of resurrection , or 'the last hour ' for the believers and unbelievers of the previous manifestation of god the eastern orthodox church teaches that there are two judgments : the first , or '' particular '' judgment , is that experienced by each individual at the time of his or her death , at which time god will decide where the orthodox do not have an understanding of '' purgatory '' rather , they believe that the souls of the departed will await the final judgment either in heaven or hell – but that there are different levels of heaven and different levels of hell – and they believe that the prayers of the church can help to ease the sufferings of the souls , but do not dogmatize as to how exactly this is accomplished one is to spend the time until the second coming of christ ( see hades in christianity ) although in modern times some have attempted to introduce the concept of soul sleep into orthodox thought about life after death , it has never been a part of traditional orthodox teaching , and it even contradicts the orthodox understanding of the intercession of the saints similarly , although orthodoxy teaches that salvation is obtained only through christ and his church , the fate of those outside the church at the last judgment is left to the mercy of god and is not declared traditionally , an orthodox church will have a fresco or mosaic of the last judgment on the back ( western ) wall so that the faithful , as they leave the services , are reminded that they will be judged by what they do during this earthly life lutherans do not believe in any sort of earthly millennial kingdom of christ either before or after his second coming on the last day , , , , , , , after the resurrection of all the dead , , , and the change of those still living , , all nations shall be gathered before christ , , , , , and he will separate the righteous from the wicked at the present period , the process of human evolution is conducted by means of successive rebirths in the physical world max heindel , the rosicrucian christianity lectures ( the riddle of life and death ) , 1908 , and the salvation is seen as being mentioned in revelation 3:12 ( kjv ) , which states '' him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out '' however , this western esoteric tradition states – like those who have had a near-death experience – that after the death of the physical body , at the end of each physical lifetime and after the life review period ( which occurs before the silver cord is broken ) , a judgment occurs , more akin to a final review or end report over one 's life , where the life of the subject is fully evaluated and scrutinized max heindel , death and life in purgatory – life and activity in heaven this judgment is seen as being mentioned in hebrews 9:27 , which states that '' it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment '' the saved are led up to heaven , often shown as a fortified gateway , while the damned are handed over to devils who herd them down into hell on the right ; the composition therefore has a circular pattern of movement there is more often a large group of saints around christ ( which may include animals ) , and the hetoimasia or '' empty throne '' , containing a cross , is usually shown below christ , often guarded by archangels ; figures representing adam and eve may kneel below it or below christ it is believed that prior to the time of qiyammah , two dangerous , evil tribes called yajooj and majooj are released from a dam-resembling wall that allah makes stronger everyday how is it possible that the coccyx does not decay at all ? what if the body was cremated ? islam stack exchange many verses of the quran , especially the earlier ones , are dominated by the idea of the nearing of the day of resurrection the doctrinal premises are ( 1 ) good will eventually prevail over evil ; ( 2 ) creation was initially perfectly good , but was subsequently corrupted by evil ; ( 3 ) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation ; ( 4 ) the '' salvation for the individual depended on the sum of that person 's thoughts , words and deeds , and there could be no intervention , whether compassionate or capricious , by any divine being to alter this in english , crack of doom is an old term used for the day of judgement , referring in particular to the blast of trumpets signalling the end of the world in chapter 8 of the book of revelation
