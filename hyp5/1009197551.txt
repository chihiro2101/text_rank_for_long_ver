the major chinese text that introduced hanja to koreans , however , was not a religious text but the chinese text cheonjamun ; thousand character classic ) although koreans had to learn classical chinese to be properly literate for the most part , some additional systems were developed which used simplified forms of chinese characters that phonetically transcribe korean , including hyangchal , gugyeol , and idu one way of adapting hanja to write korean in such systems ( such as gugyeol ) was to represent native korean grammatical particles and other words solely according to their pronunciation for example , gugyeol uses the characters to transcribe the korean word '' hăni '' , which in modern korean means '' does , and so '' even after the invention of hangul , however , most korean scholars continued to write in hanmun many words borrowed from chinese have also been replaced in the north with native korean words nevertheless , a large number of chinese-borrowed words are still widely used in the north ( although written in hangul ) , and hanja still appear in special contexts , such as recent north korean dictionaries thus the hanja being used came from the characters already being used by the chinese at the time since hanja was primarily used by the elite and scholars , it was hard for others to learn , thus much character development was limited character development of hanja can be traced further back then when the use in korea had begun even before the creation of simplified characters , hanja was already losing ground to the newly invented hangul system however , this also brings up the discussion of whether or not hanja should still be in use today or not the historical use of hanja in korea has had a change over time thus , to the knowledge that is still being used traditional characters would remain the traditional style of hanja being used 한문 교육용 기초 한자 ( 2000 ) , page 15 ( 추가자 : characters added , 제외자 : characters removed ) debate flared again in 2013 after a move by south korean authorities to encourage primary and secondary schools to offer hanja classes '' although north korea has removed chinese characters from its written materials , it has , paradoxically , ended up with an educational program that teachers more characters than either south korea or japan , as table 2 shows hanja 's language of origin , chinese , has many homophones , and hanja words became even more homophonic when they came into korean , since korean lacks a tonal system , which is how chinese distinguishes many words that would otherwise be homophonic in south korea , hanja are used most frequently in ancient literature , legal documents , and scholarly monographs , where they often appear without the equivalent hangul spelling this practice helps to eliminate ambiguity , and it also serves as a sort of shorthand etymology , since the meaning of the hanja and the fact that the word is composed of hanja often help to illustrate the word 's origin korean name are generally based on hanja , although some exceptions exist since the 1970s , some parents have given their children given names that break the chinese generation style , and are simply native korean words most atlases of korea today are published in two versions : one in hangul ( sometimes with some english as well ) , and one in hanja hanja are still required for certain disciplines in academia , such as oriental studies and other disciplines studying chinese , japanese or historic korean literature and culture , since the vast majority of primary source text material are written in hanzi , kanji , hanja , etc in 1956 , one study found mixed-script korean text ( in which sino-korean nouns are written using hanja , and other words using hangul ) were read faster than texts written purely in hangul ; however , by 1977 , the situation had reversed the pronunciation of hanja in korean is by no means identical to the way they are pronounced in modern chinese , particularly mandarin , although some chinese dialects and korean share similar pronunciations for some characters however , in most modern korean dialects ( especially south korean ones ) , is pronounced as yeo when used in an initial position , due to a systematic elision of initial n when followed by y or i
