image : circles of confusion lens diagram.svg thumb right 280px the depth of field is the region where the size of the circle of confusion is less than the resolution of the human eye '' good '' bokeh is especially important for macro lenses and long telephoto lenses , because they are typically used in situations that produce shallow depth of field in out-of-focus areas , each point of light becomes an image of the aperture , generally a more or less round disc lenses that are poorly corrected for spherical aberration will show one kind of disc for out-of-focus points in front of the plane of focus , and a different kind for points behind in the past , wide aperture lenses ( f/2 , f/2.8 ) were very expensive , due to the complex mathematical design and manufacturing know-how required , at a time when all computations and glass making were done by hand today it is much easier to make an f/1.8 lens , and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great bokeh those qualities made it the only lens of this kind on the market from its introduction in 1999 to 2014 both of these phones use dual cameras to detect edges and create a '' depth map '' of the image , which the phone uses to blur the out-of-focus portions of the photo other phones , like the google pixel , only use a single camera and machine learning to create the depth map image : faux-bokeh-comparison.jpg thumb 500px right bokeh can be simulated by convolving the image with a kernel that corresponds to the image of an out-of-focus point source taken with a real camera unlike conventional convolution , this convolution has a kernel that depends on the distance of each image point and & nbsp ; – at least in principle & nbsp ; – has to include image points that are occluded by objects in the foreground to a first approximation , defocus blur is convolution by a uniform disk , a more computationally intensive operation than the '' standard '' gaussian blur ; the former produces sharp circles around highlights whereas the latter is a much softer effect an alternative mechanical mechanism has been proposed for generating bokeh in small aperture cameras such as compacts or cellphone cameras , called image destabilisation , in which both the lens and sensor are moved in order to maintain focus at one focal plane , while defocusing nearby ones some advanced digital cameras have bokeh features which take several images with different apertures and focuses and then manually compose them afterward to one image more advanced systems of bokeh use a hardware system of 2 sensors , one sensor to take photo as usual while other ones record depth information by using barcodes as small as 3 & nbsp ; mm with a small lens over them , if the barcode is viewed out of focus through an ordinary camera focused at infinity , the resulting image is large enough to scan the information in the barcode aberration in optical systems airy disk anamorphic format circle of confusion depth of field light-field camera mandelbaum effect orb ( optics ) soft focus special effect
