bréhier , '' godfrey of bouillon '' in the catholic encyclopedia ( 1909 ) , citing haigneré , mémoires lus à la sorbonne , paris , 1868 , 213 as second son , he had fewer opportunities than his older brother and seemed destined to become just one more minor knight in service to a rich landed nobleman in fact , lower lorraine was so important to the german kingdom and the holy roman empire that henry iv , the german king and future emperor ( reigned 1084 & ndash ; 1105 ) , decided in 1076 that he would place it in the hands of his own son and give godfrey only bouillon and the margraviate of antwerp as a test of godfrey 's abilities and loyalty godfrey fought alongside henry and his forces against the rival forces of rudolf of swabia and also took part in battles in italy when henry iv actually took rome away from the pope in 1076 he had succeeded as designated heir to the lotharingian lands of his uncle , godfrey the hunchback , and godfrey was struggling to maintain control over the lands that henry iv had not taken away from him as these enemies tried to take away portions of his land , godfrey 's brothers , eustace and baldwin , both came to his aid following these long struggles and proving that he was a loyal subject to henry iv , godfrey finally won back his duchy of lower lorraine in 1087 still , godfrey 's influence in the german kingdom would have been minimal if it had not been for his major role in the first crusade raymond iv , count of toulouse , also known as raymond of saint-gilles , created the largest army at age 55 , raymond was also the oldest and perhaps the best known of the crusader nobles because of his age and fame , raymond expected to be the leader of the entire first crusade there was also the fiery bohemond , a norman knight from southern italy , and a fourth group under robert ii of flanders godfrey , along with his two brothers , started in august 1096 at the head of an army from lorraine ( some say 40,000 strong ) along '' charlemagne 's road '' , as urban ii seems to have called it ( according to the chronicler robert the monk ) —the road to jerusalem alexius i had made a separate peace with the turks and now claimed the city for the byzantine empire godfrey continued to play a minor , but important , role in the battles against the muslims until the crusaders finally reached jerusalem in 1099 natasha hodgson 'lions , tigers and bears : encounters with wild animals and bestial imagery in the context of crusading to the latin east ' viator ( 2013 ) in 1098 , godfrey took part in the siege of antioch , which fell in june of that year after long and bitter fighting bohemond , the first to enter the city gates , claimed the prize for himself bohemond decided to remain behind in order to secure his new principality ; and godfrey 's younger brother , baldwin , also decided to stay in the north in the crusader state he had established at edessa most of the foot soldiers wanted to continue south to jerusalem , but raymond iv of toulouse , by this time the most powerful of the princes , having taken others into his employ , such as tancred , hesitated to continue the march after months of waiting , the common people on the crusade forced raymond to march on to jerusalem , and godfrey quickly joined him godfrey and some of his knights were the first to take the walls and enter the city once the city was returned to christian rule , some form of government had to be set up although it is widely claimed that he took the title advocatus sancti sepulchri ( '' advocate '' or '' defender '' of the holy sepulchre ) , this title is only used in a letter which was not written by godfrey although the latins came close to capturing ascalon , godfrey 's attempts to prevent raymond of st gilles from securing the city for himself meant that the town remained in muslim hands , destined to be a thorn in the new kingdom 's side for years to come much of the evidence for this comes from william of tyre , whose account of these events is troublesome ; it is only william who tells us that dagobert forced godfrey to concede jerusalem and jaffa , while other writers such as albert of aix and ralph of caen suggest that both dagobert and his ally tancred had sworn an oath to godfrey to accept only one of his brothers or blood relations as his successor being at haifa at the time of godfrey 's death , he could do nothing to stop godfrey 's supporters , led by warner of grez , from seizing jerusalem and demanding that godfrey 's brother baldwin should succeed to the rule dagobert was subsequently forced to crown baldwin as the first latin king of jerusalem on december 25 , 1100 christian chronicles make no mention of this ; instead , albert of aix and ekkehard of aura report that godfrey contracted an illness in caesarea in june 1100 25-26 ) followed earlier writers in suggesting that since the names godfrey and geoffrey shared a common origin , godfrey is identical to the geoffrey of boulogne who appears in english records , marrying beatrice , daughter of geoffrey de mandeville and that he left behind in england a son , william de boulogne ( adult by 1106 , died c '' because he had been the first ruler in jerusalem , godfrey of bouillon was idealized in later accounts by william of tyre 's time later in the 12th century , godfrey was already a legend among the descendants of the original crusaders it is an adaptation of tasso 's poem and features godfrey as an ideal of christian kingship , possibly as a critical parallel to king philip ii of spain ( 1556–98 ) godfrey also plays key roles in the following novels : the blue gonfalon by margaret ann hubbard , which follows godfrey and his men on their journey to the holy land
