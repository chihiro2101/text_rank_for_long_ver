humans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly , due to their buoyancy in air an aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air by contrast , aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift , which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass however most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb chrysopelea also use mobile ribs to flatten their body into an aerodynamic shape , with a back and forth motion much the same as they use on the ground in an airplane , lift is created by the wings ; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired an aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil , which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it this shockwave takes quite a lot of energy to create and this makes supersonic flight generally less efficient than subsonic flight at about 85 % of the speed of sound hypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum , gravity , air drag and in some cases thrust essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight , spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space the wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by air propulsion except in the case of gliding air propulsion ( except in gliders ) lift , created by the reaction to an airflow drag , created by aerodynamic friction weight , created by gravity buoyancy , for lighter than air flight these forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur in the context of an air flow relative to a flying body , the lift force is the component of the aerodynamic force that is perpendicular to the flow direction aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction , in accordance with newton 's third law of motion lift is commonly associated with the wing of an aircraft , although lift is also generated by rotors on rotorcraft ( which are effectively rotating wings , performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air ) when an aircraft is cruising for example , lift does oppose gravity , but lift occurs at an angle when climbing , descending or banking in general , long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed , whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack , whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift 5 r v^2 ) the beginner 's guide to aeronautics - nasa glenn research center lift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings , up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings , such as gliders since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft , aircraft weight will not affect it the only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for â€“ a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words , any object less dense than air will rise if the thrust-to-weight ratio is greater than the local gravity strength ( expressed in gs ) , then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required if the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then takeoff using aerodynamic lift is possible flight dynamics is the science of air and space vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions the three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle 's center of mass , known as pitch , roll and yaw ( see tait-bryan rotations for an explanation ) different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles , motors and how well this translates into forward thrust the range that powered flight articles can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag , as well as how much energy they can store on board and how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion all animals and devices capable of sustained flight need relatively high power-to-weight ratios to be able to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff , and reverse the process for landing some aircraft can take off at low speed ; this is called a short takeoff in aircraft , successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost , breaking the laws applying to aircraft , or endangering the safety of those on board or on the earth in the latter case , the pilot will navigate exclusively using instruments and radio navigation aids such as beacons , or as directed under radar control by air traffic control a conventional fixed-wing aircraft flight control system consists of flight control surfaces , the respective cockpit controls , connecting linkages , and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft 's direction in flight aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they change speed
