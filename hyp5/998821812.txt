phrenology had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain , but broca 's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship , and has been described as '' epoch-making '' and '' pivotal '' to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science although aphasiology is the historical core of neurolinguistics , in recent years the field has broadened considerably , thanks in part to the emergence of new brain imaging technologies ( such as pet and fmri ) and time-sensitive electrophysiological techniques ( eeg and meg ) , which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks ; brown , colin m electrophysiological techniques , in particular , emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the n400 , a brain response shown to be sensitive to semantic issues in language comprehension neurolinguistics is closely related to the field of psycholinguistics , which seeks to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of experimental psychology ; today , psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another , and there is much collaboration between the two fields for example , experiments in sentence processing have used the elan , n400 , and p600 brain responses to examine how physiological brain responses reflect the different predictions of sentence processing models put forth by psycholinguists , such as janet fodor and lyn frazier 's '' serial '' model , see , for example , , which discusses how three brain responses reflect three stages of fodor and frazier 's model neurolinguists can also make new predictions about the structure and organization of language based on insights about the physiology of the brain , by '' generalizing from the knowledge of neurological structures to language structure '' neurolinguistics research investigates several topics , including where language information is processed , how language processing unfolds over time , how brain structures are related to language acquisition and learning , and how neurophysiology can contribute to speech and language pathology much work in neurolinguistics has , like broca 's and wernicke 's early studies , investigated the locations of specific language '' modules '' within the brain research questions include what course language information follows through the brain as it is processed , whether or not particular areas specialize in processing particular sorts of information , how different brain regions interact with one another in language processing , brown , colin m and how the locations of brain activation differ when a subject is producing or perceiving a language other than his or her first language the temporal ordering of specific patterns of brain activity may reflect discrete computational processes that the brain undergoes during language processing ; for example , one neurolinguistic theory of sentence parsing proposes that three brain responses ( the elan , n400 , and p600 ) are products of three different steps in syntactic and semantic processing research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages ( such as babbling ) , and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development , caplan ( 1987 ) , p while other research investigates the physical changes ( known as neuroplasticity ) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition , when adults learn a new language neuroplasticity is observed when both second language acquisition and language learning experience are induced , the result of this language exposure concludes that an increase of gray and white matter could be found in children , young adults and the elderly these techniques provide high spatial resolution , allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of activity within the brain ; temporal resolution ( or information about the timing of brain activity ) , on the other hand , is poor , since the bold response happens much more slowly than language processing in addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations , hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain 's language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time , as a function of linguistic exposure these techniques are able to measure brain activity from one millisecond to the next , providing excellent temporal resolution , which is important in studying processes that take place as quickly as language comprehension and production on the other hand , the location of brain activity can be difficult to identify in eeg ; consequently , this technique is used primarily to how language processes are carried out , rather than where neurolinguists employ a variety of experimental techniques in order to use brain imaging to draw conclusions about how language is represented and processed in the brain in which brain activation in a task thought to involve some aspect of language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes but not to involve the linguistic process another common use of violation designs is to combine two kinds of violations in the same sentence and thus make predictions about how different language processes interact with one another ; this type of crossing-violation study has been used extensively to investigate how syntax and semantic processes interact while people read or hear sentences the logic behind tms and direct cortical stimulation is similar to the logic behind aphasiology : if a particular language function is impaired when a specific region of the brain is knocked out , then that region must be somehow implicated in that language function it is frequently used in priming studies , since subjects are known to make a lexical decision more quickly if a word has been primed by a related word ( as in '' doctor '' priming '' nurse '' ) another related form of experiment is the double-task experiment , in which a subject must perform an extra task ( such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables ) while responding to linguistic stimuli ; this kind of experiment has been used to investigate the use of working memory in language processing
