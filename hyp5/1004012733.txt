little is known of his early years , but jacques de molay was probably born in molay , haute-saône , in the county of burgundy , at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire , and in modern times in the area of franche-comté , northeastern france his birth year is not certain , but judging by statements made during the later trials , was probably around 1240–1250 in 1265 , as a young man , he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house , by humbert de pairaud , the visitor of france and england around 1270 , de molay went to the east ( outremer ) , although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of 1291 , molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master it is known that molay held two general meetings of his order in southern france , at montpellier in 1293 and at arles in 1296 , where he tried to make reforms in the autumn of 1296 , molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus , which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu meanwhile , pressure increased in europe that the templars should be merged with the other military orders , perhaps all placed under the authority of one king , and that individual should become the new king of jerusalem when it was conquered in 1305 , the newly elected pope clement v asked the leaders of the military orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders on 6 june , the leaders of both the templars and the hospitallers were officially asked to come to the papal offices in poitiers to discuss these matters , with the date of the meeting scheduled as all saints day in 1306 , though it later had to be postponed due to the pope 's illness with gastro-enteritis king philip iv of france , deeply in debt to the templars , was in favor of merging the orders under his own command , thereby making himself rex bellator , or war king he did not arrive until late summer , so while waiting for his arrival , molay met the pope to discuss other matters , one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars ' initiation ceremony molay had already spoken with the king in paris on 24 june 1307 about the accusations against his order and was partially reassured les templiers , une chevalerie chrétienne au moyen-âge , alain demurger on 14 september , philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the templars , sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of france to implement a mass arrest of all templars at dawn on 13 october the pope still wanted to hear molay 's side of the story , and dispatched two cardinals to paris in december 1307 a power struggle ensued between the king and the pope , which was settled in august 1308 when they agreed to split the convictions in the royal palace at chinon , molay was again questioned by the cardinals , but this time with royal agents present , and he returned to his forced admissions made in 1307 any further opposition by the templars was effectively broken when philip used the previously forced confessions to sentence 54 templars to be burnt at the stake on 10–12 may 1310 molay was sentenced to death together with geoffroi de charney in 1314 as a direct result of cardinal legates ' decisions and actions rather than being ordered by king philip the fair these rumors are probably related to the fact that the medieval historian the templar of tyre wrote about a mongol general named '' mulay '' who occupied syria and palestine for a few months in early 1300 however , this was only an urban legend , as the only activities that the mongols had even engaged in were some minor raids through palestine , which may or may not have even passed through jerusalem itself regardless of what the mongols may or may not have done , there is no evidence that molay was ever a mongol commander , and he probably never set foot in jerusalem 357 '' the account given by the continuator of william nangis is confirmed by the clerk , geoffrey of paris , apparently an eyewitness , who describes molay as showing no sign of fear and , significantly , as telling those present that god would avenge their deaths some time later , as he was about to be executed , he appealed '' from this your heinous judgement to the living and true god , who is in heaven '' , warning the pope that , within a year and a day , he and philip iv would be obliged to answer for their crimes in god 's presence then followed the rapid succession of the last house of capet kings of france between 1314 and 1328 , the three sons and a grandson of philip iv the american historian henry charles lea wrote : '' even in distant germany philippe 's death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the templars , and clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his death-bed for three great crimes , the poisoning of henry vii , holy roman emperor , and the ruin of the templars and beguines '' some 400 years after the death of de molay and the dissolution of the knights templar , the fraternal order of freemasonry began to emerge in northern europe as described by modern historian malcolm barber in the new knighthood : '' it was during the 1760s that german masons introduced a specific templar connection , claiming that the order , through its occupation of the temple of solomon , had been the repository of secret wisdom and magical powers , which james of molay had handed down to his successor before his execution and of which the eighteenth-century freemasons were the direct heirs the full title of this order is the united religious , military and masonic orders of the temple and of st john of jerusalem , palestine , rhodes and malta the second of the two degrees , known as '' the demolay degree , '' which , along with the initiatory degree , members and observers are sworn to keep secret , dramatically recreates the trial , '' before a commission in its council chamber , '' of the historic characters named in the ritual as '' jacques demolay and his three preceptors , geoffroi de charney , godfrey de goneville , and hughes de peralde '' the drama concludes with the commission condemning the four to life imprisonment ; however , according to the ritual , '' so incensed was the king at the noble defiance and defense of demolay and geoffroi de charney that he overrode the commission ’ s verdict and hurried demolay and de charney to the stake on an island near the cathedral , where they were barbarously burned
