the french revolution gave the english language three politically descriptive words denoting anti-progressive politics : '' reactionary '' , '' conservative '' and '' right '' in this french usage , reactionary denotes '' a movement towards the reversal of an existing tendency or state '' and a '' return to a previous condition of affairs '' during the french revolution , conservative forces ( especially within the catholic church ) organized opposition to the progressive sociopolitical and economic changes brought by the revolution ; and they fought to restore the temporal authority of the church and crown in the 19th century , reactionary denoted people who idealized feudalism and the pre-modern era—before the industrial revolution and the french revolution—when economies were mostly agrarian , a landed aristocracy dominated society , a hereditary king ruled and the catholic church was society 's moral centre before the french revolution , which radically and bloodily overthrew most aspects of french society 's organisation , the only way constitutional change could be instituted was by extracting it from old legal documents that could be interpreted as agreeing with the proposal '' the conservative would have accepted many improvements brought about by the revolution , and simply refused a program of wholesale reversion use of the word '' reactionary '' in later days as a political slur is thus often rhetorical , since there is nothing directly comparable with the chambre introuvable in the history of other countries in the 20th century , proponents of socialism and communism used the term reactionary polemically to label their enemies , such as the white armies , who fought in the russian civil war against the bolsheviks after the october revolution the vichy regime in france , franco 's regime , the salazar regime in portugal and maurras 's action française political movements are examples of such traditional reactionary feelings , in favour of authoritarian regimes with strong unelected leaders and with catholicism as a state religion the italian fascism showed a desire to bring about a new social order based on the ancient feudal principle of delegation ( though without serfdom ) in their enthusiasm for the corporate state fascism was certainly not simply a return to tradition as it carried the centralised state beyond even what had been seen in absolute monarchy fascist one-party states were as centralised as most communist states , and fascism 's intense nationalism was not found in the period prior to the french revolution the fact that the nazis called their 1933 rise to power the national revolution did show that like the italian fascists they supported some form of revolution , however the nazis idealised tradition , folklore , and the tenets of classical thought and leadership ( as exemplified by frederick the great ) however they did also reject the weimar republic under the weimar constitution , which had succeeded the monarchy in 1918 , despite it also being capitalist/classical in nature although claiming to be separate from reactionism , the nazis rejection of weimar was based on ostensibly reactionary principles , as the nazis claimed that the parliamentary system was simply the first step towards bolshevism , and instead idealized more reactionary parts of germany ’ s past ) clericalism movements , sometimes labelled as clerical fascism by their critics , can be considered reactionaries in terms of the 19th century , since they share some elements of fascism , while at the same time promote a return to the pre-revolutionary model of social relations , with a strong role for the church
