three extensive apocrypha are attributed to enoch : book of enoch , composed in ancient ethiopian semitic language and preserved in ge'ez , first brought to europe by james bruce from ethiopia and translated into english by august dillmann and reverent schoode – recognized by the orthodox tewahedo churches and usually dated between the third century bc and the first century ad second book of enoch or the book of the secrets of enoch , written in old church slavonic , first translated in english by william morfill – usually dated to the first century ad the book of giants is a jewish pseudepigraphal work from the third century bc and resembles the book of enoch one view regarding enoch that was found in the targum pseudo-jonathan , which thought of enoch as a pious man , taken to heaven , and receiving the title of safra rabba ( great scribe ) the second mention is in hebrews 11 : 5 ( kjv ) which says , '' by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because god had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased god '' this suggests he did not experience the mortal death ascribed to adam 's other descendants which is consistent with genesis 5:24 ( kjv ) , which says , '' and enoch walked with god : and he was not ; for god took him '' the third mention is in the epistle of jude ( 1:14–15 ) where the author attributes to '' enoch , the seventh from adam '' a passage not found in catholic and protestant canons of the old testament the quotation is believed by most modern scholars to be taken from 1 enoch 1:9 which exists in greek , in ge'ez ( as part of the ethiopian orthodox canon ) , and also in aramaic among the dead sea scrolls 711 , though the same scholars recognise that 1 enoch 1:9 itself is a midrash of the words of moses '' he came from the ten thousands of holy ones '' from deuteronomy 33:2 in early christianity , use of the book of enoch as a divinely inspired text was widespread , since the canon had not yet been established definitively in the church because of the letter of jude 's citation of the book of enoch as prophetic text , this encouraged acceptance and usage of the book of enoch in early christian circles when amillennialism began to be common in christianity , the book of enoch , being incompatible with amillennialism , started to be rejected widespread , and with the split of the oriental orthodox from the catholic church in the 5th century , use of the book of enoch was limited primarily to the oriental orthodox church another common element that some church fathers , like john of damascus , spoke of , was that they considered enoch to be one of the two witnesses mentioned in the book of revelation this view is encountered in the standard works , the pearl of great price and the doctrine and covenants , which states that not only enoch , but the entire peoples of the city of zion , were translation ( latter day saints ) , because of their piety the book of moses in the pearl of great price includes chapters that give an account of enoch 's preaching , visions , and conversations with god the book of moses is itself an excerpt from joseph smith 's translation of the bible , which is published in full , complete with these chapters concerning enoch , by community of christ , in the joseph smith translation of the bible , where it appears as part of the book of genesis d & c 104:24 ( cofc ) / ( lds ) states that adam ordained enoch to the higher priesthood ( now called the melchizedek , after the great king and high priest ) at age 25 , that he was 65 when adam blessed him , and that he lived for an additional 365 years until he and his city were translated , making enoch 430 years old at the time that '' he was not , for god took him '' ( genesis 5:24 ) nonetheless , although some muslims view enoch and idris as the same prophet while others do not , many muslims still honor enoch as one of the earliest prophets , regardless of which view they hold
