at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity , but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice although rca 's system had enormous benefits , it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes with rca 's system , the color was changing continually along the line , which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era rca was included in this group ; on 5 february 1940 they demonstrated a system using three conventional tubes combined to form a single image on a plate of glass , but the image was too dim to be useful however , all of these projects had problems with colors bleeding from one phosphor to another in spite of their best efforts , the wide electron beams simply could not focus tightly enough to hit the individual dots , at least over the entirety of the screen moreover , most of these devices were unwieldy ; the arrangement of the electron guns around the outside of the screen resulted in a very large display with considerable '' dead space '' a more practical system would use a single gun at the back of the tube , firing at a single multi-color screen on the front another contender was general electric 's penetron , which used three stacked layers of phosphor and attempted to change the power of the electron beam to write to the correct one more common were attempts to use a secondary focussing arrangement just behind the screen to produce the required accuracy paramount pictures worked long and hard on the chromatron , which used a set of wires behind the screen as a secondary '' gun '' , further focussing the beam and steering it towards the correct color the holes would be used to focus the beam just before it hit the screen over a period of only a few months , several prototype color televisions using the system were produced by painting the colored dots at the correct locations on the screen , and leaving some room between them to avoid interactions , the guns would be guaranteed to hit the right colored spot to produce an image as bright as the one on a traditional b & w television , the electron guns in this hypothetical shadow mask system would have to be five times more powerful additionally , the dots on the screen were deliberately separated in order to avoid being hit by the wrong gun , so much of the screen was black this required even more power in order to light up the resulting image however , color sets were much more expensive than b & w sets of the same size , and required constant adjustment by field staff by 1968 almost every company had a competing design , and color television moved from an expensive option to mainstream devices these materials suffered from easy magnetization that can affect the colors , but this could be generally solved by including an automatic demagnetizing feature better focusing systems , especially automatic systems that meant the set spent more time closer to perfect focus , allowed the dots to grow larger on the screen another change that was widely introduced in the early 1970s was the use of a black material in the spaces around the inside of the phosphor pattern this method changed over time , with tv tubes growing progressively more black over time the process was used a total of three times , once for each color
