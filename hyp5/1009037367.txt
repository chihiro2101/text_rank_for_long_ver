autarky a new expression of tariff protectionism ; strategic control of key geographic territories exhibiting the same thought behind earlier designs on the suez and panama canals ; a view of controlling the land in the same way as those choke points control the sea pan-regions ( panideen ) based upon the british empire , and the american monroe doctrine , pan-american union and hemispheric defense , mattern , p.37 whereby the world is divided into spheres of influence the root of uniquely german geopolitik rests in the writings of karl ritter who first developed the organic state that would later be elaborated upon by ratzel and accepted by hausfhofer walsh ( 1949 ) , p.39 ratzel 's writings coincided with the growth of german industrialism after the franco-prussian war and the subsequent search for markets that brought it into competition with britain mattern , p.60 influenced by mahan , ratzel wrote of aspirations for german naval reach , agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining , as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine , unlike land power dorpalen , pp.66–67 haushofer was exposed to ratzel , who was friends with haushofer 's father , a teacher of economic geography , dorpalen , p.52 and would integrate ratzel 's ideas on the division between sea and land powers into his theories , saying that only a country with both could overcome this conflict while the latter two conceive of geopolitik as the state as an organism in space put to the service of a leader , haushofer 's munich school specifically studies geography as it relates to war and designs for empire dorpalen , pp.94–95 closely linked to that need was haushofer 's assertion that the existence of small states was evidence of political regression and disorder in the international system the small states surrounding germany ought to be brought into the vital german order dorpalen , pp.205–06 these states were seen as being too small to maintain practical autonomy even if they maintained large colonial possessions and would be better served by protection and organization within germany dorpalen , p.231 haushofer and the munich school of geopolitik would eventually expand their conception of lebensraum and autarky well past the borders of 1914 and '' a place in the sun '' to a neuropa , then to a new afro-european order , and eventually to a eurasian order mattern , p.17 that concept became known as a pan-region , taken from the american monroe doctrine , and the idea of national and continental self-sufficiency dorpalen , p.218 if germany could control eastern europe and subsequently russian territory , it could control a strategic area to which hostile seapower could be denied walsh ( 1949 ) , pp.14–15 after world war ii , haushofer would deny that he had taught hitler , and claimed that the national socialist party perverted hess 's study of geopolitik hitler 's biographers disagree somewhat on the extent of haushofer 's influence on hitler : ian kershaw writes that '' his influence was probably greater than the munich professor was later prepared to acknowledge , '' ian kershaw hitler : 1889-1936 : hubris new york : norton , 1998 walsh ( 1949 ) , p.15 although haushofer accompanied hess on numerous propaganda missions , and participated in consultations between nazis and japanese leaders , he claimed that hitler and the nazis only seized upon half-developed ideas and catchwords walsh ( 1949 ) , p.8 furthermore , the nazi party and government lacked any official organ that was receptive to geopolitik , leading to selective adoption and poor interpretation of haushofer 's theories walsh ( 1949 ) , p.41 he cites hitler 's speeches declaring that small states have no right to exist , and the nazi use of haushofer 's maps , language and arguments 36 walsh found that even if haushofer did not directly assist hitler , discernible new elements appeared in mein kampf , as compared to previous speeches made by hitler chapter xiv , on german policy in eastern europe , in particular displays the influence of the materials haushofer brought hitler and hess while they were imprisoned walsh ( 1949 ) , p.42 haushofer was never a member of the nazi party , and did voice disagreements with the party , leading to his brief imprisonment mattern , p.20 he refused to associate himself with anti-semitism as a policy , especially because his wife was half-jewish walsh ( 1949 ) , p.16 the idea of contact between haushofer and the nazi establishment has been stressed by several authors the occult establishment ( richard drew , 1981 ) these authors have expanded haushofer 's contact with hitler to a close collaboration while hitler was writing mein kampf and made him one of the 'future chancellor 's many mentors ' kaplan ( 2012 ) the revenge of geography : what the maps tell us about the coming conflicts and the battle against fate new york : random house
