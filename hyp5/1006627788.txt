64 diets varied according to village locations and individual income , with many people supplementing these staples with river , lake or sea fish , especially herring , and small game such as wild duck an extraordinary climatic shock , known as the '' great frost '' , struck ireland and the rest of europe between december 1739 and september 1741 following a decade of relatively mild winters although no barometric or temperature readings for ireland survive from the great frost , a scattered few records survive from englishmen who made personal readings the one outdoor reading that has survived was stated as '' thirty-two degrees of frost this kind of weather was '' quite outside the irish experience , '' notes david dickson , author of arctic ireland : the extraordinary story of the great frost and forgotten famine of 1740–41 people tried to avoid hypothermia without using up winter fuel reserves in a matter of days when in late january 1740 the traffic across the irish sea resumed , retail prices for coal soared the propertied classes began to respond to fuel and food shortages when the frost was about two weeks old this action was in response to cork corporation ( city of cork ) , which remembered vividly the city events of eleven years earlier when serious food riots erupted and four people died the great frost affected the potato , which was one of the two main staples ( the other was oatmeal ) in rural ireland they could not even serve as seeds for the next growing season '' richard purcell , one of the best rural witnesses of the unfolding crisis , reported in late february 1740 that had the frost not occurred , there would have been enough potatoes in his district to have kept the country ireland fed until august 1740 , indicating a rare local abundance of the crop this disruption of the agricultural cycle created problems in ireland in the winter of 1740–1741 the important corn crop also failed , which resulted in greater mortality in ireland than in britain or the continent 126 grains were so scarce that the irish hierarchy of the catholic church allowed catholics to eat meat four days each week during lent , but not everyone could afford meat , either dickson explains that the '' wholesale rise in the price of wheat , oats and barley reflected not just the current supply position , but the dealers ' assessment as to the state of things later in the year the officials made sure that scotland would receive no more food from their port other people simply took the bread and left '' similar skirmishes over food continued in different irish cities throughout the summer of 1740 but in the dairying districts , cows had been so weak after the frost that at least a third of them had failed to '' take bull , '' or become impregnated at breeding to make conditions worse , blizzards swept along the east coast in late october 1740 depositing snow and returned several times in november the strange autumn of 1740 pushed food prices back up , e.g five vessels loaded with grain , presumably from british america , reached galway on the west coast in june 1741 in the first week of july 1741 , grain prices at last decreased and old hoarded wheat suddenly flooded the market the food crisis was over , however , and seasons of rare plenty followed for the next two years based on contemporary accounts and burial parish records , famine-related deaths may have totalled 300,000–480,000 in ireland , with rates highest in the south and east of the country 97–98 that famine , however , was unique in '' cause , scale and timing , '' persisting over several years 127 dickson notes that an upsurge in migration out of ireland in the years after the 1740–1741 crisis did not take place , perhaps in part because conditions improved relatively quickly although the most likely primary reason was that a transoceanic voyage was far beyond the means of most of the population at this time irish dendrochronologist mike baillie has confirmed tree ring patterns in 1740 that were consistent with severe cold
