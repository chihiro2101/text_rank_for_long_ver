the name zygomycota refers to the zygosporangia characteristically formed by the members of this clade , in which resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction the term '' spore '' is used to describe a structure related to propagation and dispersal they are formed in specialized structures , the mitosporangia ( sporangia ) that contain few to several thousand of spores , depending on the species these specialized hyphae usually show negative gravitropism and positive phototropism allowing good spore dispersal the opposite mating types grow towards each other due to volatile pheromones given off by the opposite strand , mainly trisporic acid and its precursors zygospore formation is the result of a multiple step process beginning with compatible mating type zygophores growing towards each other meiosis usually occurs before zygospore germination and there are a few main types of distinguishable nuclear behavior type 1 is when the nuclei fuse quickly , within a few days , resulting in mature zygospore having haploid nuclei early trisporoid derivatives and trisporic acid induce swelling of two potential hyphae , hence called zygophores , and a chemical gradient of these inducer molecules results in a growth towards each other in the next stage , septae are established to limit the developing zygospore from the vegetative mycelium and in this way the zygophores become suspensor hyphae and gametangia are formed a selectional process ( unstudied ) results in a reduction of nuclei and meiosis takes place ( also unstudied until today ) several cell wall modifications , as well as incorporation of sporopollenin ( responsible for the dark colour of spores ) take place resulting in a mature zygospore trisporic acid , as the endpoint of this recognition pathway , can solely be produced in presence of both compatible partners , which enzymatically produce trisporoid precursors to be further utilized by the potential sexual partner species specificity of these reactions is among others obtained by spatial segregation , physicochemical features of derivatives ( volatility and light sensitivity ) , chemical modifications of trisporoids and transcriptional/posttranscriptional regulation this interaction is an example for biotrophic fusion parasitism , because genetic information is transferred into the host many morphological similarities in comparison to zygospore formation are seen , but the mature spore is called a sikyospore and is parasitic for example , in pilobolus crystallinus light is responsible for the dispersal mechanism and the sporangiophores of phycomyces blakesleeanus grow towards light when light , particularly blue light , is involved in the regulation of fungal development , it directs the growth of fungal structures and activates metabolic pathways for instance , the zygomycota use light as signal to promote vegetative reproduction and growth of aerial hyphae to facilitate spore dispersal the formation of these sporangiophores work at different light fluences and therefore with specific photoreceptors in contrast , the sexual development of phycomyces is inhibited by light because of a specialized photoreceptor system the zygomycota sporangiophores originate from specialized “ basal hyphae ” and pass through several distinctive developmental stages until the mature asexual spores are released in addition to the positive phototropism , the sporangiophores are directed by a negative gravitropic response into a position suitable for spore dispersal and distribution the only model for the mechanism of the gravitropic reaction of phycomyces is based on the floatability of the vacuole within the surrounding cytoplasm the resulting asymmetric distribution of the cytoplasm is proposed to generate increased wall growth on the lower side of horizonally placed sporangiophores as in the thicker cytoplasmic layer forming there the number of vesicles secreting cell-wall material would be higher than on the upper side in phycomyces blakesleeanus , wild type sporangiophores contain large , easily seen octahedral paracrystalline crystals with size up to 5×5×5 & nbsp ; μm studies of the bending angle of wild type and mutant strain sporangiophore growth have shown that mutant strains that do not have crystals exhibit reduced gravitropic response mutants that lack this lipid complex show greatly lowered gravitropic response when incubated in liquid culture under semi-anaerobic conditions , several species grow in yeast like state in liquid culture , zygomycota usually form a bland mass and do not produce spores sexual reproduction in rhizopus stolonifer , as in other zygomycetes , occurs when haploid hyphae of different mating types are in close proximity to each other growth of the gametangia commences after gametangia come in contact , and plasmogamy , or the fusion of the cytoplasm , occurs different mechanisms for forcible spore discharge have evolved among members of the zygomycete order entomophthorales the evolution of sporangiospores typical of zygomycetes to conidia similar to those found in ascomycetes can be modeled by a series of forms seen in zygomycetes some have evolved multiple small sporangiola that contain few sporangiospores
