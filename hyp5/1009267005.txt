many analyses have been made of this ; all show that when the entropy of room and demon are taken together , this total entropy does increase the current consensus hinges upon the boltzmann-shannon identification of the logarithm of phase space volume with the negative of information theory , and hence to entropy as the system evolves in the presence of dissipation , the molecular coordinates can move into larger volumes of phase space , becoming more uncertain , and thus leading to increase in entropy other possible states of the universe ( for example , a universe at heat death equilibrium ) would actually result in no increase of entropy in this view , the apparent t-asymmetry of our universe is a problem in cosmology : why did the universe start with a low entropy ? this view , supported by cosmological observation ( such as the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background , connect this problem to the question of initial conditions of the universe the laws of gravity seem to be time reversal invariant in classical mechanics ; however , specific solutions need not be the modern view of black hole irreversibility is to relate it to the second law of thermodynamics , since black holes are viewed as thermodynamic objects however , time reversal itself is seen not to be a symmetry ( this is usually called cp violation ) time reversal violation is unrelated to the second law of thermodynamics , because due to the conservation of the cpt symmetry , the effect of time reversal is to rename particles as antiparticles and vice versa thus the second law of thermodynamics is thought to originate in the initial conditions in the universe strong measurements ( both classical and quantum ) are certainly disturbing , causing asymmetry due to the second law of thermodynamics
