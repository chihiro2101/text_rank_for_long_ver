as part of the compromise of avranches , henry was purged of any guilt in becket 's murder but he agreed that the secular courts , with few exceptions ( high treason being one of them , and forest law another ) , had no jurisdiction over the clergy in the new world of the british colonies , the two soldiers convicted of manslaughter in the 1770 boston massacre were spared execution for manslaughter under the benefit of clergy , but underwent branding of their right thumbs to prevent them from invoking the right in any future murder case ( see tudor reforms below ) thus , an illiterate person who had memorized the appropriate psalm could also claim the benefit of clergy , and psalm 51:1 became known as the '' neck verse '' because knowing it could save one 's neck by transferring one 's case from a secular court , where hanging was a likely sentence , to an ecclesiastical court , where both the methods of trial and the sentences given were more lenient the benefit of clergy was commonly applied as a means of judicial mercy : in elizabethan england , courts might allow more than 90 % of clergyable offenders the benefit of clergy , which is extremely high in light of the literacy rate of the period in 1488 , henry vii decreed that non-clergymen should be allowed to plead the benefit of clergy only once : those pleading the benefit of clergy , but not able to prove through documentation of their holy orders that they actually were clergymen , were branded on the thumb , and the brand disqualified them from pleading the benefit of clergy in the future whereas before , the benefit was pleaded before a trial to have the case transferred to an ecclesiastical court , under the new system the benefit of clergy was pleaded after conviction but before sentencing , and it did not nullify the conviction , but rather changed the sentence for first-time offenders from probable hanging to branding and up to a year 's incarceration v cavenagh ( 1689 ) 12 state trials 629 when the literacy test was abolished in 1706 , the lesser sentence given to those who pleaded benefit of clergy was increased to up to 6–24 months ' hard labour under the transportation act of 1718 , those who pleaded benefit of clergy could be sentenced to seven years ' banishment to north america the american revolution ( 1775–1783 ) disrupted the application of this punishment ( although two of the british soldiers convicted for their roles in the 1770 boston massacre made use of benefit of clergy to receive reduced punishments ) but it survived well into the mid 19th century in some state courts ( for example , south carolina granted a defendant benefit of clergy in 1855 ) many states and counties have abolished the clergy benefit by proclamation , statute or judicial decision ; in others , it simply has fallen into disuse without formal abolition
