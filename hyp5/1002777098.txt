the first use of the name rambler for an american made automobile dates to 1897 when thomas b as steel quotas ( related to the korean war ) eased , the rambler line was broadened in both its model types ( first a station wagon and 2-door hardtop dubbed '' country club '' , and later a 2-door sedan a further expansion of the line for 1954 included a four-door sedan and station wagon called '' cross country '' ) on a stretched wheelbase , which proved to be as successful as the first generation of two-door sedan convertibles the first generation of modern ramblers carried a modified version of nash 's airflyte styling , which included closed wheel openings rambler became a marque in its own right for the 1957 model year the nash and hudson makes were continued as a '' senior '' model only through 1957 , after which all of amc 's offerings were marketed as ramblers , with the exception of the imported 1958â€“1962 metropolitan at the start of the 1960s george romney made a marketing decision that more fully unified the various rambler model names under the rambler brand ) in 1958 , amc introduced america 's first '' compact car , '' the rambler american however , the car was an instant success and lost sales only after the '' big three '' ( gm , ford , and chrysler ) each introduced compact cars of their own ( gm '' x '' body , ford falcon , chrysler a platform ) beginning in 1962 , all '' senior '' rambler models would share the same automobile platform with identical wheelbase and body parts , but the engines , trims , and equipment levels distinguished the classic from the ambassador in 1963 , the entire rambler line received the motor trend car of the year award in addition , amc introduced the marlin , a hardtop fastback intended to enter amc in the more youth and personal luxury market segments as well as also positioning it as a halo effect in what hindsight would show to be an ill-conceived decision , american motors began to phase it out in favor of an amc marque beginning in 1966 , as it attempted to become a multiplatform automobile manufacturer retention of the well-known rambler brand name and its association with compact economy models could have served amc well in the 1970s while amc planned to produce only 500 for the 1969 model year , the '' scrambler '' proved popular so two more groups of about 500 each were built for the final year in 1969 the models were simply called rambler the last u.s.-built rambler was produced on 30 june 1969 , and it was one of over 4.2 million cars to carry the rambler name that rolled off the assembly line in kenosha this registration was opposed by amc and the court determined that even though the manufacturing of ramblers ended , the trademark was not abandoned because amc continued to have commercial activities such as parts with the rambler name on the boxes as well franchised dealers with rambler in their name or marketing used cars under the rambler trademark
