the operation is called the knot sum , or sometimes the connected sum or composition of two knots depending on how this is done , two different knots ( but no more ) may result having a preferred direction of travel along the knot , and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle while you can not form the unknot in three dimensions by adding two non-trivial knots , you can in higher dimensions , at least when one considers smooth knots in codimension at least 3 knot tables generally include only prime knots , and only one entry for a knot and its mirror image ( even if they are different ) conway 's 1970 paper on knot theory also contains a typographical duplication on its non-alternating 11-crossing knots page and omits 4 examples — 2 previously listed in d see perko ( 1982 ) , primality of certain knots , topology proceedings less famous is the duplicate in his 10 crossing link table : 2.-2.-20.20 is the mirror of 8 -20 : -20 the notation simply organizes knots by their crossing number one writes the crossing number with a subscript to denote its order amongst all knots with that crossing number this order is arbitrary and so has no special significance ( though in each number of crossings the twist knot comes after the torus knot ) links are written by the crossing number with a superscript to denote the number of components and a subscript to denote its order within the links with the same number of components and crossings alexander–briggs names in the range 10 162 to 10 166 are ambiguous , due to the discovery of the perko pair in charles newton little 's original and subsequent knot tables , and differences in approach to correcting this error in knot tables and other publications created after this point the 2 & minus ; 3 2 is a sequence describing the continued fraction associated to a rational tangle any link admits such a description , and it is clear this is a very compact notation even for very large crossing number the last example is usually written 8 3:2 0 , where the ones are omitted and kept the number of dots excepting the dots at the end for an algebraic knot such as in the first example , 1 is often omitted however , rather than every crossing being represented by two different numbers , crossings are labeled with only one number knotinfo : table of knot invariants and knot theory resources the knot atlas — detailed info on individual knots in knot tables knotplot — software to investigate geometric properties of knots knotscape — software to create images of knots knoutilus — online database and image generator of knots knotdata.html — wolfram mathematica function for investigating knots
