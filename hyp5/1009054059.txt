this group of disorders affects connective tissues across the body , with symptoms most typically present in the joints , skin , and blood vessels however , as connective tissue is found throughout the body , eds may result in an array of unexpected impacts with any degree of severity , and the condition is not limited to joints , skin , and blood vessels effects may range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening cardiovascular complications due to the diversity of subtypes within the eds family , symptoms may vary widely between individuals diagnosed with eds osgoodâ€“schlatter disease , a painful lump on the knee , is common as well skin may tear and bruise easily , and may heal with abnormal atrophic scars , and atrophic scars that look like cigarette paper are a sign seen including in those whose skin might appear otherwise normal ligaments in neck are unable to heal properly , therefore , the neck structure does not have the ability to support the skull , which can then sink into the brain stem blocking the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid , leading to issues related to the autonomic nervous system failing to work properly most forms of eds are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause a disorder children should be taught that demonstrating the unusual positions that they can maintain due to loose joints should not be done , as this may cause early degeneration of the joints the ways to manage pain can be to modify pain management techniques used in the normal population chronic pain has two types the first type is the nociceptive type , which is caused by injury sustained to tissues the second type is neuropathic pain , caused by abnormal signals by the nervous system in most cases , the pain is an unequal mix of the two however , long-term use is nsaids is often a risk factor of gastrointestinal , renal , and blood-related side effects opioids have shown efficiency in some eds cases for management of both acute and chronic pain it can also be injected into painful areas in the case of musculoskeletal pain the instability of joints , leading to subluxations and joint pain , often requires surgical intervention in people with eds after surgery , the degree of stabilization , pain reduction , and people 's satisfaction can improve , but surgery does not guarantee an optimal result ; affected peoples and surgeons report being dissatisfied with the results consensus is that conservative treatment is more effective than surgery , particularly since people have extra risks of surgical complications due to the disease three basic surgical problems arise due to eds - the strength of the tissues is decreased , which makes the tissue less suitable for surgery ; the fragility of the blood vessels can cause problems during surgery ; and wound healing is often delayed or incomplete surgery in people with eds requires careful tissue handling and a longer immobilization afterward extreme joint instability , chronic musculoskeletal pain , degenerative joint disease , frequent injuries , and spinal deformities may limit mobility secondary conditions such as autonomic dysfunction or cardiovascular problems , occurring in any type , can affect prognosis and quality of life although all types of eds are potentially life-threatening , most people have a normal lifespan those with blood-vessel fragility , though , have a high risk of fatal complications , including spontaneous arterial rupture , which is the most common cause of sudden death
