the concept of bolshevism arose at the second congress of the russian social democratic labour party ( 1903 ) as a result of the split of the party into two factions : supporters of lenin and the rest despite the ordinal number adopted in soviet historiography , the london congress was actually a constituent one , since the minsk congress had no practical significance one of the main reasons for the split was the question of a party of a new type although in the subsequent history of the russian social democratic labor party , lenin 's supporters often found themselves in the minority , they were assigned the politically advantageous name '' bolsheviks '' there is an opinion that the adoption of such an unprofitable name of the faction was a major blunder for martov and , on the contrary : the consolidation of the momentary electoral success in the name of the faction was a strong political move of lenin as lenin 's biographer robert service points out , the division of the newly created party into two factions '' plunged russian marxists into a state of shock '' in this work the thesis about the unevenness of economic and political development of capitalism in the epoch of imperialism was expressed and theoretically grounded , which leads to the conclusion about the possibility of the victory of socialism initially in a few or in one single country , which is not yet economically developed enough – such as russia – provided that the head of the revolutionary movement will be a disciplined avant–garde , ready to go all the way to the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat it was with this that lenin 's criticism of the so–called '' social patriotism '' , who supported their governments in the world war , was connected '' socialism and war ( attitude of the russian social–democratic labor party to war ) pages 133 by the beginning of the february revolution , the leading figures of the bolshevik faction were mainly in exile or in emigration , and therefore the bolsheviks did not take an organized part in it from the very beginning , while still abroad , lenin insisted on the immediate break of the petrograd soviet with the provisional government in order to actively prepare for the transition from the bourgeois–democratic to the next , '' proletarian '' stage of the revolution , the seizure of power and the end of the war returning to russia , he came up with a new program of action for the bolshevik party – the april theses – in which he put on the agenda the demand for the transfer of all power to the soviets in the interests of the proletariat and the poorest peasantry paradoxes of october in the course of the unfolding controversy about the possibility of socialism in russia , lenin rejected all the critical arguments of the mensheviks , socialist revolutionaries and other political opponents about the country 's unpreparedness for a socialist revolution due to its economic backwardness , weakness , lack of culture and organization of the working masses , including the proletariat , about the danger the split of the revolutionary democratic forces and the inevitability of a civil war in march 1918 , the party adopted the name of the communist party of the soviet union , the famous theorist of marxism karl kautsky explained the change in the name of lenin 's party as follows : the bolsheviks destroyed the democracy that the people had conquered in the march revolution lenin , in his speech on april 28 , calls the soviet organization '' the highest type of democracy '' , '' a complete break with its bourgeois caricature '' in 1990 , at the last , 28th congress of the communist party of the soviet union , during the legalization of political platforms within the communist party of the soviet union , the bolshevik platform was formed , giving rise to several modern political parties and social movements according to the british historian orlando figes , the opinion that the bolsheviks were raised to the top of power by massive popular support for their party is not true and is a delusion yekaterinburg : ural state law academy , 2013 – pages 289–309 alexander parvus wrote in 1918 : the present soviets terrorize not only the reactionaries and capitalists , but also the democratically inclined bourgeoisie and even all socialist workers ' organizations that disagree with their opinion the bolsheviks were supported , although not without criticism of their political practice , some of the mistakes of this criticism were examined by georg lukács in his work « critical notes on the brochure of rosa luxemburg '' russian revolution '' » // georg lukacs from democracy to state slavery and the extreme left supporters of '' council communism '' , for example , otto rühle otto rühle '' party and class '' the answer to the extreme leftist criticism was given by lenin in the brochure '' childhood illness of '' leftism '' in communism '' , in turn antonie pannekoek answered to vladimir lenin in the work '' world revolution and communist tactics '' according to the philosopher and linguist nikolai trubetzkoy : the authors of the black book of communism note : from the moment of its organizational formation in 1903 , this party differed from all other currents of both russian and world social democracy primarily by its voluntarist strategy of overthrowing the existing order and its concept of party organization – a rigidly structured , disciplined one , consisting of selected professional revolutionaries , parties are the antipode of vague mass parties , widely open to sympathizers , to the struggle of opinions and discussions , that is , the way the russian mensheviks and almost all european social democrats were russian president vladimir putin , answering questions in the federation council on june 27 , 2012 , accused the bolshevik leadership of betraying national interests – '' the bolsheviks committed an act of treason
