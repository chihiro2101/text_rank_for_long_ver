in other words , the idea is that individuals ' most basic needs must be met before they become motivated to achieve higher-level needs if these '' deficiency needs '' are not met – except for the most fundamental ( physiological ) need – there may not be a physical indication , but the individual will feel anxious and tense maslow 's idea suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire ( or focus motivation upon ) the secondary or higher-level needs maslow also coined the term '' metamotivation '' to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time , maslow stated that a certain need '' dominates '' the human organism thus maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind , but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met once a person 's physiological needs are relatively satisfied , their safety needs take precedence and dominate behavior love needs include : family friendship intimacy this need for love may overcome the physiological and security needs , depending on the strength of the peer pressure in contrast , for some individuals , the need for self-esteem is more important than the need for love ; and for others , the need for creative fulfillment may supersede even the most basic needs most people have a need for a stable esteem , meaning which is soundly based on real capacity or achievement the '' lower '' version of esteem is the need for respect from others , and may include a need for status , recognition , fame , prestige , and attention this level of need refers to the realization of one 's full potential for example , sex is placed with other physiological needs which must be satisfied before a person considers '' higher '' levels of motivation some critics feel this placement of sex neglects the emotional , familial , and evolutionary implications of sex within the community , although others point out that this is true of all of the basic needs the higher-order ( self-esteem and self-actualization ) and lower-order ( physiological , safety , and love ) needs classification of maslow 's hierarchy of needs is not universal and may vary across cultures due to individual differences and availability of resources in the region or geopolitical entity/country once again , only two levels of needs were identified ; therefore , people have the ability and competence to recall and estimate the importance of needs with regards to satisfaction of needs during the war , in the us there were three levels : physiological needs , safety needs , and psychological needs ( social , self-esteem , and self-actualization ) the term '' self-actualization '' may not universally convey maslow 's observations ; this motivation refers to focusing on becoming the best person that one can possibly strive for in the service of both the self and others maslow 's term of self-actualization might not properly portray the full extent of this level ; quite often , when a person is at the level of self-actualization , much of what they accomplish in general may benefit others , or '' the greater good '' abulof argues that while maslow stresses that '' motivation theory must be anthropocentric rather than animalcentric , '' he posits a largely animalistic hierarchy , crowned with a human edge : '' man 's higher nature rests upon man 's lower nature , needing it as a foundation and collapsing without this foundation… our godlike qualities rest upon and need our animal qualities after all , the latter , according to maslow , constitutes '' an inner , more biological , more instinctoid core of human nature , '' thus '' the search for one 's own intrinsic , authentic values '' checks the human freedom of choice : '' a musician must make music , '' so freedom is limited to merely the choice of instrument .
