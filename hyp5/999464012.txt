as the eldest child of king alfonso and eleanor —who preferred to give birth to a son and therefore later king— , she was the heiress presumptive of the throne of castile for several years because many of the children born later to the couple died shortly after birth or in early infancy , and so berengaria became a greatly desired bride throughout europe berengaria 's first engagement was agreed in 1187 when her hand was sought by conrad , the fifth child of holy roman emperor frederick i barbarossa berengaria 's status as heir of castile when she inherited the throne was based in part on documentation in the treaty and marriage contract , which specified that she would inherit the kingdom after her father or any childless brothers who may come along conrad would only be allowed to co-rule as her spouse , and castile would not become part of the empire in order to help secure peace between castile and león and by becoming a mediator between her father and her husband , berengaria married alfonso ix of león , her first cousin once removed , in valladolid in 1197 most of these were along the border with castile , and the nobles who ran them in her name were allowed to seek justice from either king in the event of being wronged by the other though she had left her role as queen of león , she retained authority over and taxing rights in many of the lands she had received there , including salamanca and castroverde , which she gave to her son ferdinand in 1206 at the end of may the situation in castile had grown perilous for berengaria , so she decided to take refuge in the castle of autillo de campos , which was held by gonzalo rodríguez girón ( one of her allies ) and sent her son ferdinand to the court of his father his guardian , count álvaro núñez de lara , tried to hide the fact , taking the king 's body to the castle of tariego , although it was inevitable that the news would reach berengaria therefore , she kept her brother 's death and her own accession secret from alfonso in part , she abdicated as she would be unable to be the military leader castile needed its king to be in that time another instance in which berengaria 's mediation stood out developed in 1218 when the scheming lara family , still headed by former regent álvaro núñez de lara , conspired to have alfonso ix , king of león and king ferdinand 's father , invade castile to seize his son 's throne however , the capture of count lara facilitated the intervention of berengaria , who got father and son to sign the pact of toro on 26 august 1218 , putting an end to confrontations between castile and león in 1224 she arranged the marriage of her daughter berengaria to john of brienne , a maneuver which brought ferdinand iii closer to the throne of león , since john was the candidate alfonso ix had in mind to marry his eldest daughter sancha by proceeding more quickly , berengaria prevented the daughters of her former husband from marrying a man who could claim the throne of león perhaps her most decisive intervention on ferdinand 's behalf took place in 1230 , when alfonso ix died and designated as heirs to the throne his daughters sancha and dulce from his first marriage to theresa of portugal , superseding the rights of ferdinand iii
