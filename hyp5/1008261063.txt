the chain of being hierarchy has god at the top , above angels , which like him are entirely spirit , without material bodies , and hence unchangeable beneath them are humans , consisting both of spirit and matter ; they can change and die , and are thus essentially impermanent the minerals are , in the medieval mind , a possible exception to the immutable of the material beings in the chain , as alchemy promised to turn lower elements like lead into those higher up the chain , like silver or gold god has created all other beings and is therefore outside creation , time , and space in christian angelology , angels are immortal beings of pure spirit without physical bodies , so they require temporary bodies made of earthly materials to be able to do anything in the material world the basic idea of a ranking of the world 's organisms goes back to aristotle 's biology the scala allowed for an ordering of beings , thus forming a basis for classification where each kind of mineral , plant and animal could be slotted into place in the northern renaissance , the scientific focus shifted to biology ; the threefold division of the chain below humans formed the basis for carl linnaeus 's systema natur√¶ from 1737 , where he divided the physical components of the world into the three familiar kingdoms of minerals , plants and animals since all beings were linked into a chain , so that there was a fundamental unity of all matter , transformation from one place in the chain to the next might , according to alchemical reasoning , be possible in turn , the unit of matter enabled alchemy to make another key assumption , the philosopher 's stone , which somehow gathered and concentrated the universal spirit found in all matter along the chain , and which ex hypothesi might enable the alchemical transformation of one substance to another , such as the base metal lead to the noble metal gold the set nature of species , and thus the absoluteness of creatures ' places in the great chain , came into question during the 18th century the dual nature of the chain , divided yet united , had always allowed for seeing creation as essentially one continuous whole , with the potential for overlap between the links the chain of being continued to be part of metaphysics in 19th century education , and the concept was well known the idea of the great chain as well as the derived '' missing link '' was abandoned in early 20th century science , as the notion of ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny was abandoned in biology
