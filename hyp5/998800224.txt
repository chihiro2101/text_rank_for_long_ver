a dutch east india company expedition of 90 calvinism settlers , under the command of jan van riebeeck , founded the first permanent settlement near the cape of good hope in 1652 the earliest colonists were , for the most part , from the lower , working class and displayed an indifferent attitude towards developing the colony , but after a commissioner that was sent out in 1685 to attract more settlers , a more dedicated group of immigrants began to arrive by the late 1700s the cape colony was one of the best developed european settlements outside europe or the americas the two pillars of the cape colony 's economy for almost the entirety of its history were shipping and agriculture its strategic position meant that prior to the opening of the suez canal in 1869 almost every ship sailing between europe and asia stopped off at the colony 's capital cape town the dutch east india company government passed a law in 1787 subjecting the remaining nomadic khoikhoi to certain restrictions neither the hostility of the natives , nor the struggle to make agriculture profitable on karoo or veld , slowed the progress made by the colonists as much as the narrow and tyrannical policy adopted by the dutch east india company seeking largely to escape the oppression of the dutch east india company , the farmers trekked farther and farther from the seat of government to avoid collision with the bantu tribes advancing south and west from east central africa , the dutch agreed in 1780 to make the great fish river the boundary of the colony
