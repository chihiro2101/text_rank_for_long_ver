little is known of the music of brazil before the area 's first encounter with portuguese explorers on 22 april 1500 some information is available in writings left by such travellers as jean de léry , who lived in brazil from 1557 to 1558 and produced the first known transcriptions of native american music : two chants of the tupinambá , near rio de janeiro one century later , the reduções of the southern brazil , which were founded by spaniard jesuits , had a strong cultural development , where some music schools were founded ( portuguese ) the indigenous people also took part in the music , with both the construction of musical instruments and practice of vocal and instrumental performance ( portuguese ) with the impoverishment of the mines at the end of the century , the focus of the musical activity changed to other centers , specially rio de janeiro and são paulo , where andré da silva gomes , a composer of portuguese origin , released a great number of works and dynamized the musical life of the city the works of these composers strongly influenced the brazilian music of this time he also composed the first opera written in brazil , le due gemelle ( the two twins ) , with text in italian , but the music is now lost other important composers of this period are gabriel fernandes da trindade , who composed the only brazilian chamber music from the 19th century which has survived to the present times , castagna , paulo and , despite the love of peter i of brazil for the music – he was also author of some musical pieces like the brazilian independence anthem – the difficult financial situation did n't allow many luxuries in the beginning of the 20th century , there was a movement for creating an authentically brazilian music , with less influences of the european culture some composers like brasílio itiberê da cunha , luciano gallet and alexandre levy , despite having a european formation , included some typically brazilian elements in their works this trend reached the highest point with alberto nepomuceno , who used largely the rhythms and melodies from the brazilian folklore later , guerra-peixe and santoro followed an independent way , centered in the regional music carlos gomes was the first composer on non-european origin to achieve wide recognition in the classical music environment of the golden age of opera in italy nowadays , brazilian music follows the guidelines of both experimentalism and traditional music the brazilian music industry opened up to international styles and this has allowed for both foreign and local genres to co-exist and identify people in recent years brazilian artists have become more interested in africa , the caribbean and their own indigenous and folk music while there are some artists who continue to perform rock and western pop , there are now just as many contemporaries playing a fusion of african and european influences with those from across the americas some artists have even become influenced by asian music , noticing some parallels between music from the north-east of brazil and music from india little is known about their music , since no written records exist of this era with the arrival of europeans , brazilian culture began to take shape as a synthesis of native musical styles with portuguese music and african music the afro-brazilian sport of capoeira is never played without its own music , which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music capoeira songs may be improvised on the spot , or they may be popular songs written by older , and ancient mestres ( teachers ) , and often include accounts of the history of capoeira , or the doings of great mestres by the 1950s and 1960s it was replaced by samba and bossa nova and other styles of brazilian popular music , but was still alive in amateur circles called '' rodas de choro '' ( informal choro gatherings in residences and botecos ) in 1929 , prompted by the opening of the first radio station in rio de janeiro , the so-called radio era began spreading songs – especially the novelty samba in its current format – to larger masses bossa nova was introduced to the rest of the world by american jazz musicians in the early 1960s , and song '' the girl from ipanema '' remains probably the best known brazilian musical export , eventually becoming a jazz standard from the late 1960s the first singers of christian music groups emerged in brazil , but the songs were not highly valued the musical style known in brazil as '' brazilian rock n ' roll '' dates back to nora ney 's '' ronda das horas '' , a portuguese version of '' rock around the clock '' in 1954 it was also in the 1990s that the first seeds of what would grow into being the brazilian indie scene were planted , with the creation of indie festivals such as abril pro rock and , later in the decade , porão do rock the band pato fu was considered by time magazine one of the ten best bands in the world outside the united states other unique example of success through independent music scene that made to the mainstream is the band móveis coloniais de acaju the band has its own style , somewhere between rock and folk , and is recognized as the most important independent band in brazil today , the best known band in the country is massacration , a brazilian satirical heavy metal band , self-proclaimed the '' greatest band in the world '' the new brazilian folk scene is not to be mistaken with folkloric brazilian music the first to break into the mainstream was internet phenomenon mallu magalhães , who played covers of her favourite artists in english and her own songs in both english and portuguese ( as well as other languages ) magalhães only released her first album in 2008 , though by then she was already widely recognised as the voice of this sudden new brazilian folk scene her ex-boyfriend hélio flanders is the lead singer of another brazilian folk group called vanguart writing in english is more and more common among brazilian rock and folk artists this has been highly criticised by portuguese language purists , though it has helped to promote brazilian artists in other countries ( css is a perfect example ) brazil has a long tradition of psychedelic music since artists like os mutantes , ronnie von and other rock bands from the late 60s funk carioca is a type of dance music from rio de janeiro , derived from and was until the late 1990s , superficially similar to miami bass in rio it is most often simply known as funk , although it is very different musically from what funk means in most other places and contexts the genre went public with great impact in the 80s , with songs like feira de acari by mc batata , with furacão 2000 , mc marlboro and brazilian versions of freestyle songs by the singer latino , later turning into a more aggressive song , with an apology for violence , drugs , weapons and promiscuity in the 1990s , with precarious lyrics and several mcs with direct links with drug trafficking the singer ludmilla was also a relevant name in brazilian pop music , the singer emerged from funk carioca and passed a mix of the genres the expansion of the pop genre in brazil prompted singers of other styles to join the movement , such as luan santana , banda vingadora , jhama , gaby amarantos , tiago iorc , among others in são paulo and other places in the south of brazil , in more urban areas , hip hop music is very popular são paulo has gained a strong , underground brazilian rap scene since its emergence in the late 1980s with many independent labels forming for young rappers to establish themselves on in the 1990s in rio de janeiro , funk as well as rap were reported by the press to have been adopted by the drug lords of the city as a way to market their drugs at dance hall events
