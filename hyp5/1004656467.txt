instead , it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an '' epochal '' religious revelation the sadlers came to observe the episodes , and over time , the individual produced verbal communications that claimed to be from '' student visitor '' spiritual beings he wrote in an appendix that there were two cases that he had not explained to his satisfaction : the other exception has to do with a rather peculiar case of psychic phenomena , one which i find myself unable to classify much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought , to the way in which he has been taught , and to his entire philosophy '' sadler presented this development to the group , and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness , but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers '' the communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the forum studied the book in depth , and according to sadler and others , permission to publish it was given to them in 1955 the urantia book is approximately 2,000 pages long , and consists of a body of 196 '' papers '' divided in four parts , and an introductory foreword : part i , titled '' the central and superuniverses , '' addresses what the authors consider the highest levels of creation , including the eternal and infinity '' universal father , '' his trinity associates , and the '' isle of paradise part iii , '' the history of urantia , '' compiles a broad history of the earth , presenting a purported explanation of the origin , evolution , and destiny of the world and its inhabitants '' part iv , '' the life and teachings of jesus , '' is the largest part at 775 pages , and is often noted as the most accessible and most impressive , narrating a detailed biography of jesus that includes his childhood , teenage years , family life , and public ministry , as well as the events that led to his crucifixion , death , and resurrection '' god , according to the book , is one deity who functions on a range of different levels of reality , both personal and impersonal these persons are referred to by additional titles in the book , primarily as the '' universal father , '' '' eternal son , '' and '' infinite spirit '' while stating that the concept of one god in three persons is difficult to fully understand , the book says that the idea : '' many types of celestial beings are enumerated in the book , and one of particular note is a joint '' offspring '' of the universal father and eternal son called a '' creator son god is described as the father of each individual , and through the direct gift of a fragment of his eternal spirit , called a thought adjuster , is said to be able to guide the individual toward an increased understanding of him the thought adjuster is a central teaching of the book and is also referred to as a '' mystery monitor '' and '' indwelling presence , '' as well as a '' divine spark in relation to biblical traditions , the thought adjuster is said to be the meaning behind the phrases '' being made in god 's image '' and the '' kingdom of god is within you '' : each person is said to receive one such fragment at the time of his or her first independent moral decision , on average around the age of five years and 10 months the book says that a person ultimately is destined to fuse with his or her divine fragment and become one inseparable entity with it as the final goal of faith the hebrew prophet elijah being taken to heaven without death in '' chariots of fire '' is said to be a rare example in recorded history of a person who translated instead of experiencing death '' the book regards human life on earth as a '' short and intense test , '' and the afterlife as a continuation of training that begins in material life the term '' master universe '' refers to what in modern usage would be the total universe—all existing matter and space taken as a whole the book 's extensive teachings about the history of the world include its physical development about 4.5 billion years ago , the gradual changes in conditions that allowed life to develop , and long ages of organic evolution that started with microscopic marine life and led to plant and animal life in the oceans , later on land progress is said to follow a divine plan that includes periodic gifts of revelation and ministry by heavenly teachers , which eventually will lead to an ideal world status of '' light and life '' in the far distant future although there is the ideal and divine plan of progression , it is said to be fostered and administered by various orders of celestial beings who are not always perfect more than one third of the content of the urantia book is devoted to a narrative of the life and teachings of jesus , and the judeo-christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other lewis notes that from the perspective of the book being a '' revelation , '' it could be claimed the '' celestial beings '' simply found areas of adventist belief to be accurate and therefore presented and expanded on them the book can be seen as belonging in the genre of spiritual literature that includes a course in miracles and conversations with god gardner compares it with oahspe , noting that though oahspe is '' vastly inferior to the ub both in ideas and style of writing , '' they are similar in claiming to have been written by celestial beings channelled through a human conduit , teaching that there is '' one ultimate god who oversees a vast bureaucracy of lesser deities '' while both outline an elaborate cosmology the book 's claimed supernatural origin has been compared to similar claims of the book of mormon , science and health , the quran , and the bible , with belief in it not being seen as necessarily a greater leap in reason '' the stance of the book is that there '' is not a urantia religion that could not profitably study and assimilate the best of the truths contained in every other faith martin gardner considers part iv to be an especially '' well-written , impressive work , '' and says , '' either it is accurate in its history , coming directly from higher beings in position to know , or it is a work of fertile imagination by someone who knew the new testament by heart and who was also steeped in knowledge of the times when jesus lived because the book does not support certain tenets of christianity , such as the atonement doctrine , while at the same time presenting an account of parts of jesus ' life absent in the bible , others with a christian viewpoint have argued it can not be genuine in paper 101 , '' the real nature of religion , '' the authors write : we full well know that , while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come , within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries the appeal to convenience that post-1955 scientific knowledge is not being presented is consistent with a book written by humans in the 1950s instead of celestial beings with superior knowledge examples of criticisms regarding the science in the urantia book include : the described formation of the solar system is consistent with the chamberlin-moulton planetesimal hypothesis , which though popular in the early part of the 20th century , was discarded by the 1940s after major flaws were noted according to the book 's descriptions , the universe is hundreds of billions of years old and periodically expands and contracts — '' respires '' — at 2-billion-year intervals while some adherents of the book believe that all of the information in the urantia book including its science is literally true , others accept that the science is not fully accurate for example , meredith sprunger , a liberal believer in the urantia book and retired minister of the united church of christ , wrote that research '' has revealed that virtually all of the scientific material found in the ub was the accepted scientific knowledge of the period in which the book was written , was held by some scientists of that time , or was about to be discovered or recognized they believe more of its science — if not all of it — will be proven correct in the future because the book is said to have been written by the revelators by 1935 while then was not being published until 1955 , discoveries from science during the two intervening decades are often declared to be prophetic by believers , while skeptics point out that edits could have been made to the book up to its 1955 publication he says , '' this amazing passage , written in the 1930s , anticipates scientific results that did not actually appear in the scientific literature until many decades later the urantia book states in its foreword that more than one thousand '' human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings '' were selected in preparing the papers the authors say that they were required to '' give preference to the highest existing human concepts pertaining to the subjects to be presented '' and would '' resort to pure revelation only when the concept of presentation has had no adequate previous expression by the human mind '' one of the authors wrote in part iv : '' i well know that those concepts which have had origin in the human mind will prove more acceptable and helpful to all other human minds '' in recent years , students of the papers have found that the free use of other sources appears to be true the use of outside source materials was studied separately by gardner , and gooch , and they concluded , consistent with their respective conclusion that the book 's author ( s ) must have been human , that the book therefore plagiarized many of the sources noted by block ( in addition to the book 's '' heavy indebtedness to hopkins , '' gardner discovered that hopkins was a major reference in an earlier book authored by sadler , adding to gardner 's view that it is more likely sadler had a hand in writing or editing the urantia book than that celestial beings wrote it ) likewise , much of the urantia book material relating to the evolution of mankind appears to have been directly taken from henry fairfield osborn , man rises to parnassus : critical epochs in the prehistory of man published by princeton university press in 1928 swann writes on page 64 of the architecture of the universe ( italics indicate edits as compared to the urantia book , bolding indicates deletions ) : contrast with the urantia book ' s version : block and other believers do not see the use of the source materials as plagiarism , but express a view instead that the quality of the way the material was borrowed is consistent with authorship by celestial beings and that study of the sources leads to an even deeper understanding of the urantia book gooch , a professor of english , assessed that the use of the sources '' does reveal to us an author with a busy genius for metaphysical invention and poetic turns of phrase whose scam was at worst benign and at most visionary readers sometimes join study groups after reading on their own for years or decades , others join them soon after developing an interest in the book , while '' for most , worship remains as individual as the act of reading sarah lewis notes that , '' the urantia revelation is not securing legitimacy through historically known and accepted means to any great degree , nor is it even using common language that would increase the likelihood of understanding and therefore acceptance '' pato banton reggae artist and toaster explained in several interviews how the discovery of the urantia book answered many questions he had sustained during a fifteen-year spiritual quest , and how he discovered his personal relationship with god through it
