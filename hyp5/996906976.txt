however , his father magnus minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210 , which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier his brothers or half-brothers — eskil , karl , and bengt — were all born long before 1200 , and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother upon examination of his bones in 2002 , it was determined that birger would have been just around 50 at the time of his death , about 10 years younger than previously believed birger , thus most likely born at the time for the battle of gestilren in 1210 and named after his uncle birger brosa , one of the most potent men of the era who died in 1202 , started his career in the mid-1230s by marrying ingeborg eriksdotter , the sister of king eric xi of sweden according to the eric chronicles ( erikskrönikan ) in fierce rivalry with other suitors during the 15 years to follow , birger then consolidated his position and was probably one of the most influential men years before being formally given the title jarl in 1248 by king eric xi thumb when the papal diplomat william of modena visited present sweden around 1248 , he urged the swedish kings to fulfill the rules of the catholic church , an exhortation which birger seems to have taken as a chance to strengthen his position by simply taking the side of the church against other members of his family ( alternatively it 's possible to interpret this as a manifestation of his pious side ) this was a choice of historical importance as it was to make birger a jarl powerful enough to ultimately wind up the office , thus making him the last swedish jarl ever , even called as the '' first true king of sweden '' by historians as this happened during an era when the inherited concept folkung became more of a political party , it also meant swedish magnates lost most of their influence which paved the way for a consolidated swedish kingdom supported by the pope presumably later that year , birger led an expedition to finland , later dubbed as the second swedish crusade , which permanently established the swedish rule in finland the marriage was contracted relatively near the time when ingeborg 's brother the once-deposed eric xi returned from exile in denmark in 1234
