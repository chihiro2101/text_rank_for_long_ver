melody groves ( 2006 ) , ropes , reins , and rawhide , , although steer riding contests existed into the 1920s , the sport did not gain popularity until bulls were returned to the arena and replaced steers as the mount of choice in addition to the prca , which has prca prorodeo with bull riding and the xtreme bulls events for bull riding only , there is the professional bull riders ( pbr ) , which stages a large number of events in the united states , canada , mexico , brazil , and australia , since 1994 from these roots , bull riding as a competitive sport has spread to a number of other nations worldwide the rider and bull are matched randomly before the competition , although starting in 2008 , some ranked riders are allowed to choose their own bulls from a bull draft for selected rounds in pbr events the rider must attempt to stay on the bull for at least eight seconds , while only touching the bull with their riding hand originally , the rules required a 10-second ride , but that was changed to the current eight seconds throughout the ride , bullfighters , also popularly known as rodeo clowns , stay near the bull to aid the rider if necessary the rider is given a chance to ride one bull per night the total points scored by the end of the event are recorded , and after the first or first two go-rounds , the top 20 riders are given a chance to ride one more bull scores of zero are quite common , as many riders lose control of the animal almost immediately after the bull leaves the bucking chute judges look for constant control and rhythm in the rider in matching their movements with the bull the ability to control the bull well allows riders to gain extra style points one move particular to bulls is a belly roll ( '' sunfishing '' ) , in which the bull is completely off the ground and kicks either his hind feet or all four feet to the side in a twisting , rolling motion bulls also are more likely than horses to spin in tight , quick circles , and are less likely to run or to jump extremely high ( '' break in two '' ) for the bull , judges look at the animal 's overall agility , power and speed ; his back legs kick , and his front end drops if a rider fails to stay mounted for at least 8 seconds , the bull is still awarded a score if a rider scores sufficiently low due to poor bull performance , the judges may offer the rider the option of a re-ride in addition to the sound the bell produces , it also gives the rope some weight , allowing it to fall off the bull once a rider has dismounted the number of bull riders with vests grew over the months , and by the fall of that year , the vast majority of riders were using them truly skilled riders will often spur the bull in the hope of achieving extra style points from the judges however , starting in the early 1990s , a small number of them were riding either with a protective face mask underneath their hat or with a modified , full ice hockey helmet an even smaller number rode with a lacrosse helmet by 2003 , though still a minority , helmeted bull riders were more common than ever , and the number of contestants who rode with helmets grew throughout the rest of the 2000s by the early 2010s , manufacturers were building helmets made specifically for bull riding around the same time , most up-and-comers were already riding with helmets in 2013 , the pbr made it mandatory that all contestants at their events who were born on or after october 15 , 1994 ride with a full bull riding helmet if it is applied improperly a rider may request to ride again , as the bull will not buck well if the flank strap is too tight the arenas used in professional bull riding vary common to all arenas is a large , open area that gives the bulls , bull riders , and bull fighters plenty of room to maneuver in mexico , there are a number of american-style bull riding organizations the latter of which is mexico 's top organization that includes all of american rodeo 's standard events , including bull riding bull riders can win in excess of 100,000 a year while competing in either of these organizations , and it is not uncommon for riders to compete in both of them the competitions are run and scored in a similar style to that used in the united states the 2010 pbr finals were held over two nights at the australian equine and livestock events centre ( aelec ) , with five top-ranked professional bull riders from the united states and 25 of australia 's best bull riders contesting the event however , in smaller associations , a cattle prod is still sometimes used to ensure that the animal leaves the chute as soon as the rider nods their head spurs are also a source of controversy , though modern rodeo rules place strict regulations on the type and use of spurs and participants point out that they are a tool commonly used in other non-rodeo equestrian disciplines
