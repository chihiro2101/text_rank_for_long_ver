beckett called this part the ‘ narration , a student ’ s guide to the plays of samuel beckett ( london , faber and faber , 1978 ) , pp 172,173 as paul lawley says in '' beckett ’ s dramatic counterpoint : a reading of play '' , “ the second half of the text ( preceded by a five second long blackout ) – called ‘ meditation ’ by beckett himself – sheds a subtle new light on the first , ‘ beckett ’ s dramatic counterpoint : a reading of play ’ in journal of beckett studies 9 ( 1983 ) “ they cope with the light in various ways and natures but she also wonders if she is perhaps a little ‘ unhinged ’ ( meaning that she may go mad ) ) myth and ritual in the plays of samuel beckett ( london and toronto : fairleigh dickinson university press , 1987 ) , p 158 “ if the play consisted only of the narration it would be as though the light were obliging them not only to speak , but to speak only of these events , to tell only this story ” many of beckett 's plays and prose pieces are located “ in ‘ places ’ which may strike us as being most adequately described as ‘ hell ’ , ‘ limbo ’ or ‘ purgatory ’ – and the parallels with dante are always tempting ” – and indeed the most popular interpretation of play is that the three are in some place like this , ‘ patterns of rejection sex and love in beckett ’ s universe ’ in ben-zvi , l ) women in beckett : performance and critical perspectives ( urbana and chicago : university of illinois press , 1992 ) , p 61 also “ not only does w1 threaten both her own life and that of w2 , but w1 describes herself as ‘ dying for dark , ’ beckett , s , collected shorter plays of samuel beckett , p 157 and w2 affirms , ‘ i felt like death ) women in beckett : performance and critical perspectives ( urbana and chicago : university of illinois press , 1992 ) , p 167 beckett tasked himself with re-reading all of racine ’ s plays in the mid-1950s and james knowlson suggests that “ this daily diet of racinian claustrophobia forced beckett to concentrate on the true essentials of theatre : time , space and speech which pointed him in the direction that made a tightly focused , monologic play like happy days or play possible , damned to fame : the life of samuel beckett ( london : bloomsbury , 1996 ) , p 426 it is conceivable that the three parties are not actually dead at all joyce ’ in disjecta : miscellaneous writings and a dramatic fragment ( london : calder publications , 1983 ) , p.33 ;
