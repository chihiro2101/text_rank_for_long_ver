despite family opposition , and after two elopements , they became engaged in the autumn and were married in february 1837 one of mitchel 's first steps into irish politics was to face down threats of orange retaliation by helping arrange , in september 1839 , a public dinner in newry for daniel o'connell , the leader of the campaign to repeal the acts of union 1800 and restore a reformed irish parliament ch iii until his marriage , john mitchel had by and large taken his politics from his father who , according to mitchel 's early biographer william dillon , had '' begun to comprehend the degradation of his countrymen '' '' i think the nation will do very well '' , he wrote martin , while at the same time revealing that he knew how the country '' ought to take '' news that an additional 20,000 british troops were to be deployed to ireland but would not put it on paper for fear of arrest for the next two years mitchel wrote both political and historical articles and reviews for the nation the nation newspaper , 1845 on 8 november , in an article titled '' the detectives '' , he wrote , '' the people are beginning to fear that the irish government is merely a machinery for their destruction ; the nation newspaper , 1844 on 14 february 1846 mitchel wrote again of the consequences of previous autumn 's potato crop losses , condemning the government 's inadequate response , and questioning whether it recognised that millions of people in ireland who would soon have nothing to eat on 28 february , he observed that the coercion act , then going through the house of lords , was '' the only kind of legislation for ireland that is sure to meet with no obstruction in that house '' however they may differ about feeding the irish people , the one thing all english parties were agreed upon was '' the policy of taxing , prosecuting and ruining them '' the nation newspaper , 1846 in an article on '' english rule '' on 7 march 1846 , mitchel wrote : '' the irish people are expecting famine day by day in the months before o'connell 's death , duffy circulated letters received from james fintan lalor in which he argued that independence could be pursued only in a popular struggle for the land lalor advised only against a general uprising : the people , he believed , could not hold their own against the country 's english garrison o'connell and his son john were determined to press the issue in january 1847 , they formed themselves anew as the irish confederation with , in michael doheny words , the '' independence of the irish nation '' the objective and '' no means to attain that end abjured , save such as were inconsistent with honour , morality and reason '' gill & son , ltd , 1951 edition pg 111–112 but unable to secure a pronouncement in favour of lalor 's policy , making control of land the issue in a campaign of resistance , mitchel soon broke with his confederates when in may 1846 mitchel first met carlyle in a delegation with duffy in london , he wrote to john martin describing the scotsman 's presence as '' royal , almost godlike '' , and did so even while acknowledging carlyle 's unbending unionism mitchel 's response was not join o'connell in proclaiming himself '' the friend of liberty in every clime , class and color '' o'connell , an address in conciliation hall , in dublin on september 29 , 1845 recorded by frederick douglass in a letter to william lloyd garrison this duffy discovered in 1847 when conceding temporary editorship of the nation to mitchel he found that he had lent a journal , '' recognised throughout the world as the mouthpiece of irish rights '' , to '' the monstrous task of applauding negro slavery and of denouncing the emancipation of the jews '' see also ( another of o'connell 's liberal causes against which mitchel stood with carlyle ) carlyle later said , when mitchel was on trial , '' irish mitchel , poor fellow… i told him he would most likely be hanged , but i told him , too , that they could not hang the immortal part of him he later explained that he had come to regard as '' absolutely necessary a more vigorous policy against the english government than that which william smith o'brien , charles gavan duffy and other young ireland leaders were willing to pursue '' '' while he would admit no principle that distinguished his position from the '' conspirators of ninety-eight '' ( the original united irishmen ) , mitchel emphasised that he was not recommending '' an immediate insurrection '' : in the '' present broken and divided condition '' of the country '' the people would be butchered '' such actions would be illegal , but such was his opposition to british rule that in mitchel 's view , no opinion in ireland was '' worth a farthing which is not illegal '' the prospectus announced that as editor mitchel would be '' aided by thomas devin reilly , john martin of loughorne and other competent contributors '' who were likewise convinced that '' ireland really and truly wants to be freed from english dominion the earl of clarendon , englishman , calling himself her majesty 's lord lieutenant – general and general governor of ireland , '' mitchel stated that the purpose of the journal was to resume the struggle which had been waged by tone and emmet , the holy war to sweep this island clear of the english name and nation commenting on this first edition of the united irishman , lord stanley in the house of lords , on 24 february 1848 , maintained that the paper pursued '' the purpose of exciting sedition and rebellion among her majesty 's subjects in ireland '' from the dock he declared that he was satisfied that he had '' shown what the law is made of in ireland '' , and that he regretted nothing : '' the course which i have opened is only commenced '' aboard ship he began writing his jail journal , in which he reiterated his call for national unity and resistance his defence of slavery in the southern states was '' the subject of much surprise and general rebuke '' , while his advocacy of european revolution alienated the catholic church hierarchy in december 1863 he resigned from the enquirer and became the leader writer for the richmond examiner , regularly attacking davis for misplaced chivalry , especially his failure to retaliate in kind for federal attacks on civilians although he had been among the first to claim that slavery had not been not the cause of the conflict but simply the pretext for northern aggression , mitchel objected : to allow blacks their freedom was to concede that the south had been in the wrong from the start but he remained defiant to the end , going so far as to '' raise the blasphemous doubt '' as to whether general robert e but by 1867 he was back in new york resuming the publication of the irish citizen mitchel 's anti-reconstruction , pro-democratic party editorial line was opposed in new york by another ulster protestant , the irb exile david bell bell 's '' journal of liberty , literature , and social progress '' , irish republic , cautioned readers '' interested in the labor question '' from associating themselves with john mitchel ( a '' miserable man '' ) and with a '' diabolical '' democratic plan to impose upon blacks in the south , '' as a substitute for chattel slavery , a system of serfdom scarcely less hateful than the institution it is intended to practically prolong '' it claimed mitchel defended a democratic party policy in the south that was nothing less than '' an attempt to attach to the laborer in america those medieval conditions which even russia emancipation reform of 1861 has rejected '' the revived citizen failed to attract readers and folded in 1872 ; bell 's irish republic followed a year later neither paper was in sympathy with the ethnic-minority catholicism powerfully represented by the city 's tammany hall democratic-party political machine and , until his death in 1864 , by the authority of a third ulsterman , archbishop john hughes mitchel dedicated his paper to '' aspirants to the privileges of american citizenship ” , arguing that the more integrated ( or '' more lost '' ) among american citizens the irish in america were '' the better ” hughes nonetheless used mitchel 's stance on slavery to discredit him : as mitchel saw it , '' copying the abolition press to cast an alabama plantation '' in his '' teeth ” while his visit to ireland was ostensibly private , mitchel revealed that he had pressed to stand for british parliament and that it was his intention , if any vacancy should occur , to offer himself as a candidate so that he might '' get the irish members to put in operation the plan suggested by o ’ connell at one time , of declining to attend in parliament altogether , that is , to try to discredit and explode the fraudulent pretence of representation in the parliament of britain '' in the same speech , mitchel dismissed the irish home rule movement : '' the fact that this home rule league his friend john martin among them goes to parliament and sets it hope therein , puts me in indignation against the home rule league … they are not home rulers but foreign rulers patrick 's day , 17 march 1875 , expressed his gratitude to the voters of tipperary for supporting him in exposing the ‘ fraudulent ’ system of irish representation in parliament on the day mitchel died , the tipperary paper the the nenagh guardian offered '' an american view of john mitchel '' : a syndicated piece from the chicago tribune that declared mitchel a “ recreant to liberty ” , a defender of slavery and secession with whom “ the union masses of the american people '' could have '' little sympathy '' the home-rule freeman ’ s journal wrote of mitchel : '' we may lament his persistence in certain lines of action which his intelligence must have suggested to him could have but been futile issue … his love for ireland may have been imprudent freeman ’ s journal , 22 march 1875 the standard , with which mitchel had contended in 1847 , concluded : '' his powers through life , however , were marred by want of judgment , obstinate opinionativeness , and a factiousness which disabled him from ever acting long enough with any set of men '' standard , 22 march 1875 patrick pearse 's remarks , just a month before he took command of the 1916 easter rising , may have sealed mitchel 's reputation for irish republicans pearse 's eulogy was seconded by the sinn féin leader arthur griffith who , however , did feel constrained in a preface to a 1913 edition of mitchel 's jail journal , to comment that an irish nationalist needed no excuse for '' declining to hold the negro his peer in right '' with reference to the black lives matter movement , petitions were launched , receiving over 1,200 signatures from the newry residents , calling for a statue of mitchel in the centre of the town to be removed , and john mitchel place , in which it stands , to be renamed with the support of unionist members who feared “ creating a dangerous precedent ” ( people might '' find other streets and names where they ’ d find fault with it or have some issue from a historical context '' ) , the nationalist majority newry , mourne and down district council , in june 2020 , agreed only that council officers '' proceed to clarify responsibility for the john mitchel statue , develop options for an education programme , identify the origins of john mitchel place and give consideration as to other potential issues in relation to slavery within the council area ” mitchel 's recent biographer , anthony russell , who recommends that mitchel 's statue in newry '' be accompanied by at least an explanation of the context – perhaps even by a work of art condemning slavery '' , argues that mitchel 's stand on slavery was not an aberration faced with the alternative of a social system of the north in which the relation of master to servant was regulated by competition , '' he took his stand in favour of the system that seemed to him the better of the two ; and as was his habit , he took it decisively '' haverty , new york , 1859 an apology
