a covert channel is so called because it is hidden from the access control mechanisms of secure operating systems since it does not use the legitimate data transfer mechanisms of the computer system ( typically , read and write ) , and therefore can not be detected or controlled by the security mechanisms that underlie secure operating systems covert channels are exceedingly hard to install in real systems , and can often be detected by monitoring system performance they can also be removed manually with a high degree of assurance from secure systems by well established covert channel analysis strategies by contrast , secure operating systems can easily prevent misuse of legitimate channels , so distinguishing both is important a covert channel is created by a sender process that modulates some condition ( such as free space , availability of some service , wait time to execute ) that can be detected by a receiving process the tcsec defines two kinds of covert channels : storage channels - communicate by modifying a '' storage location '' , such as a hard drive requires analysis of covert storage channels to be classified as a b2 system and analysis of covert timing channels is a requirement for class b3 ordinary things , such as existence of a file or time used for a computation , have been the medium through which a covert channel communicates the possibility of covert channels can not be completely eliminated , although it can be significantly reduced by careful design and analysis the detection of a covert channel can be made more difficult by using characteristics of the communications medium for the legitimate channel that are never controlled or examined by legitimate users for example , a file can be opened and closed by a program in a specific , timed pattern that can be detected by another program , and the pattern can be interpreted as a string of bits , forming a covert channel sandford ii ( 2005 ) they employ the osi model as a basis for their development in which they characterize system elements having potential to be used for data hiding besides suggesting the use of the reserved fields of protocols headers ( that are easily detectable ) at higher network layers , they also propose the possibility of timing channels involving csma/cd manipulation at the physical layer their covert channel analysis does not consider issues such as interoperability of these data hiding techniques with other network nodes , covert channel capacity estimation , effect of data hiding on the network in terms of complexity and compatibility assuming block of various sizes are transmitted on the lan , software overhead is computed on average and novel time evaluation is used to estimate the bandwidth ( capacity ) of covert channels are also presented these techniques are analyzed considering security mechanisms like firewall network address translation
