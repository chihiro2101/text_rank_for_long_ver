the physical symptoms such as skin soreness , pain and odor may also affect quality of life for example , obstetric injury may precede onset by decades , but menopause changes in the tissue strength reduce in turn the competence of the compensatory mechanisms the most common factors in the development are thought to be obstetric injury and after effects of anorectal surgery , especially those involving the anal sphincters and hemorrhoidal vascular cushions this means that even with normal anal canal pressure , focal defects such as the keyhole defect can be the cause of substantial symptoms the risk of injury is greatest when labor has been especially difficult or prolonged , when forceps are used , with higher birth weights or when an midline episiotomy is performed since the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions contribute 15 % of the resting anal tone , surgeries involving these structures may affect continence status rare causes of traumatic injury to the anal sphincters include military or traffic accidents complicated by pelvic fractures , spine injuries or perineum lacerations , insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum , and sexual abuse nontraumatic conditions causing anal sphincter weakness include scleroderma , damage to the pudendal nerves and ias degeneration of unknown cause radiation induced fi may involve the anal canal as well as the rectum , when proctitis , anal fistula formation and diminished function of internal and external sphincter occur many people with fi have a generalized weakness of the pelvic floor , especially puborectalis increased pudendal nerve terminal motor latency may indicate pelvic floor weakness there must also be efficient co-ordination of rectal sensation and relaxation of the anal canal whilst anismus is largely a functional disorder , organic pathologic lesions may mechanically interfere with rectal evacuation
