krishnatmika - the one who is soul of krishna laadobai- the people of kundinapur address her by this name , as it is her birthplace although born of an earthly king , her position as an incarnation of goddess lakshmi is described throughout puranic literature : goddess lakshmi is forever united with the lord ( vishnu purana 1.9.144 ) a hero among the kurus , the supreme lord himself , govinda , married king bhishmaka 's daughter , vaidarbhi rukmini , who was a direct expansion of the goddess of fortune sriyo maatraam ( sb 10.54.60 ) lakshmi by her portion took birth on earth as rukmini in the family of bhismaka there is a legend that lord krishna asked the mishmi people to cut their hair as a form of punishment for not allowing him to marry rukmini she fell in love with and longed for krishna , whose virtue , character , charm and greatness she had heard much of in the same way , shri krishna also started loving rukmini in his heart after hearing about her glories krishna knowing her to be a repository of intelligence , auspicious marks , magnanimity , beauty , good behaviour and other qualities , likewise considered her a suitable wife and decided to marry her he also went to attend her svayamvara but rukmini 's eldest brother rukmi though was a friend of evil king kamsa , who was killed by krishna and was set against the marriage she said that he may wonder how will he accomplish this without any bloodshed , considering that she is in the inner apartments of her palace , but the solution to this problem was that she would have to visit the temple of goddess girija , who is their family deity jarasandha , not so trusting , sent all his vassals and allies along because he felt that krishna would certainly come to snatch rukmini away while balarama occupied most of them and held them back rukmi had almost caught up with krishna and rukmini rukmi used abusive and offensive words for rukmini for which krishna was about to kill him , rukmini fell at the feet of krishna and begged that her brother 's life be spared according to folklore , krishna came to the village of madhavpur ghed after kidnapping and marrying rukmini at this very place this story is absent in the main scriptures pertaining to krishna 's life satyabhama , another queen of krishna , prides herself on the love krishna has for her and her grasp over his heart rukmini , on the other hand , is a devoted wife , humble in her service of her lord on one occasion , sage narada arrived in dwaraka and in the course of conversation hinted to satyabhama that the love that krishna exhibits towards her is not all that real and in fact , it is rukmini who has real control over his heart narada , with his way with words , tricked her into accepting a vrata ( ritual ) where she has to give krishna away in charity to narada and reclaim him by giving the weight of krishna in wealth with satyabhama 's ego duly raised , she tells narada that she can mobilize so much wealth that it is a child 's play for her to outweigh krishna they agree out of love for krishna but alas , it is of no use krishna remains a mute witness to all this drama and rubs salt into the open wounds of satyabhama 's ego that the king of dwaraka will now become a slave to some rishi and will have to suffer the separation from his dear wife she finally swallows her pride and appeals to the devoted first wife of krishna
