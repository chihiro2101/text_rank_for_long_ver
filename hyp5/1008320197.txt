since they state that the sensations produced by the organs of hearing are the most erotic , they intend to listen to various tales of depravity from four veteran prostitutes , which will inspire them to engage in similar activities with their victims either at the outset , or during the writing of the work , de sade had evidently decided he would not be able to complete it in full and elected to write out the remaining three-quarters in brief and finish it later the four principal characters are wealthy men , who are libertine , ruthless , and each '' lawless and without religion , whom crime amused , and whose only interest lay in his passions & nbsp ; the four men are : the duc de blangis – aged 50 , an aristocrat who acquired his wealth by poisoning his mother for the purposes of inheritance , prescribing the same fate to his sister when she found out about his plot he used to be a judge and especially enjoyed handing out death sentences to defendants he knew to be innocent in the selection process , the boys are dressed as girls to help the four in making selections there are also several cooks and female servants , those in the latter category later being dragged into the proceedings being short of writing materials and fearing confiscation , he wrote it in tiny writing on a continuous roll of paper , made up of individual small pieces of paper smuggled into the prison and glued together sade incited a riot among the people gathered outside when he shouted to them that the guards were murdering inmates ; as a result , two days later on 4 july 1789 , he was transferred to the asylum at charenton , '' naked as a worm '' and unable to retrieve the novel in progress sade described his work as '' the most impure tale that has ever been told since the world began '' feminist writer simone de beauvoir wrote an essay titled '' must we burn sade ?
