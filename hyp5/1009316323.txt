there are three distinct types of muscles : skeletal muscles , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle upon stimulation by an action potential , skeletal muscles perform a coordinated contraction by shortening each sarcomere muscle tissue also contains a stored supply of a fast acting recharge chemical , creatine phosphate , which when necessary can assist with the rapid regeneration of adp into atp functions such as heartbeat and lungs ( which are capable of being willingly controlled , be it to a limited extent ) are involuntary muscles but are not smooth muscles acetylcholine , ( a neurotransmitter used in skeletal muscle contraction ) is released from the axon terminal of the nerve cell when an action potential reaches the microscopic junction called a synapse a group of chemical messengers cross the synapse and stimulate the formation of electrical changes , which are produced in the muscle cell when the acetylcholine binds to receptors on its surface an impulse from a nerve cell causes calcium release and brings about a single , short muscle contraction called a muscle twitch also , a loss of function at the junction can produce paralysis motor unit coordination , balance , and control frequently come under the direction of the cerebellum of the brain a tendon connects this muscle to a bone , making this function possible aerobic atp production is biochemically much slower and can only be used for long-duration , low-intensity exercise , but produces no fatiguing waste products that can not be removed immediately from the sarcomere and the body , and it results in a much greater number of atp molecules per fat or carbohydrate molecule
