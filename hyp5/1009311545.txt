small daily changes and noticeable semi-annual changes in the timing of sunsets are driven by the axial tilt of earth , daily rotation of the earth , the planet 's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the sun , and the earth and moon 's paired revolutions around each other this date depends on the viewer 's latitude ( connected with the earth 's slower movement around the aphelion around july 4 ) likewise , the earliest sunset does not occur on the winter solstice , but rather about two weeks earlier , again depending on the viewer 's latitude likewise , the same phenomenon exists in the southern hemisphere , but with the respective dates reversed , with the earliest sunsets occurring some time before june 21 in winter , and latest sunsets occurring some time after december 21 in summer , again depending on one 's southern latitude ) the sun also appears larger on the horizon , an optical illusion , similar to the moon illusion at sunrise and sunset , when the path through the atmosphere is longer , the blue and green components are removed almost completely , leaving the longer wavelength orange and red hues we see at those times some of the most varied colors at sunset can be found in the opposite or eastern sky after the sun has set during twilight depending on weather conditions and the types of clouds present , these colors have a wide spectrum , and can produce unusual results on mars , the setting sun appears about two-thirds the size as it appears from earth , due to the greater distance between mars and the sun the colors are typically hues of blue , but some martian sunsets last significantly longer and appear far redder than is typical on earth instead , the air is full of red dust , blown into the atmosphere by high winds , so its sky color is mainly determined by a mie theory process , resulting in more blue hues than an earth sunset one study also reported that martian dust high in the atmosphere can reflect sunlight up to two hours after the sun has set , casting a diffuse glow across the surface of mars
