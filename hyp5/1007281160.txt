in 1892 he was appointed as a member of the senate 's law-drafting committee at the relatively young age of 31 the finnish answer was mainly legislative and constitutional resistance , of which svinhufvud became a central figure as a judge in the court of appeals originally a moderate of the finnish party or old finnish party , after his dismissal svinhufvud became a strict constitutionalist who regarded the resistance of judges and officials as a question of justice , not believing that political expediency offered compromises he moved to helsinki to work as a lawyer and participated in the political activities both of the diet and of a secret society , kagal svinhufvud played a key role in the birth of a new parliamentary system in 1905 and he was elected as a young finnish party member of the new parliament in 1906 after being appointed as a judge in heinola in 1906 , he attempted to keep out of the front line of politics svinhufvud was appointed as chairman of the senate on 27 november 1917 , and was a key figure in the announcement of finland 's declaration of independence on 6 december 1917 is : lenin tunnusti suomen tasan sata vuotta sitten – kohtasi suomalaisdelegaation pää painuksissa ja harmitteli myöhemmin lipsahdustaan ( in finnish ) this is how the meeting is told in svinhufvud 's biography svinhufvud ja itsenäisyyssenaatti written by erkki räikkönen : svinhufvud 's senate also authorized general mannerheim to form a new finnish army on the basis on white guard , the ( chiefly rightist ) volunteer militia called the suojeluskunta , an act simultaneously coinciding with the beginning of the civil war in finland on 18 may , svinhufvud became protector of state or regent , retaining this post as head of state after he stood down as chairman of the senate on 27 may after germany 's defeat in world war i , and the failed attempt to make finland a monarchy under the king of finland ( frederick charles of hesse was elected ) , svinhufvud withdrew from public life and was active only in the rightist suojeluskunta-militia svinhufvud was elected president in 1931 , and appointed mannerheim as chairman of the defence council , not least of all as an answer to the lapua movement 's fear of having fought the civil war in vain the turning point came with the president 's broadcast radio speech , in which he called on the rebels to surrender and ordered all civil guard members who were heading for mäntsälä to return to their homes : his speech stopped the rebellion before anything serious happened svinhufvud was not a supporter of parliamentarism , or to put it differently , he believed that the president had a right to choose the cabinet ministers after first consulting the parliamentary parties svinhufvud strongly supported it , because he believed that it could effectively fight the great depression ( which it did , generally speaking ) , he believed that kivimäki had a strong personality like himself , and possibly because he hoped that the agrarians and swedish people 's party would let the kivimäki government remain in office as a lesser evil , the greater evil being an agrarian-social democratic government on the other hand , when a right-wing conservative member of parliament , edwin linkomies , proposed in 1934 that finland abandon parliamentarism in favour of a government led by the president and that the president be given an absolute veto power over the laws passed by the parliament , svinhufvud opposed his ideas he believed it to be better for finland if the social democrats could be kept outside of the cabinet
