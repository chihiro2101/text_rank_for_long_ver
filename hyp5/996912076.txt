they send up long , arching canes that typically do not flower or set fruit until the second year of growth ; some varieties , known as everbearing or primocane bearing produce fruit on the tips of first-year canes the thorny varieties are sometimes grown for game cover and occasionally for protection the leaves of brambles are often used as a main food source for captive phasmatodea split bramble stems are traditionally used as binding material for straw in production of lip-work basketry , such as lip-work chairs and bee skeps and sometimes used to protect other fruits such as strawberries young leaves contain a toxin that can be harmful to many species of phasmatodea , however this only occurs up until their third instar , by which time they have developed an immunity to it image : scythe brambles.jpg thumb right scything woodland brambles in kent , england , preparatory to poisoning emerging new spring shoots rubus fruticosus is difficult to eradicate once it has become established light but established infestations in friable , workable soils may be removed by cutting back the stems to about above the ground , to leave a handle , and forking out the bramble stump with as much of the root as possible heavy infestations may make the land completely impenetrable and will require cutting first just to access the stems the root systems will also be so pervasive that removing them would require digging up the entire area ; doing this in woodland areas will cause unacceptable damage to the surface roots of trees and to flowering bulbs and should be avoided however , a heavily infested area of uncut brambles will require an inordinate amount of poison to wet the leaves ; it is far cheaper , and more effective , to cut the area as close to ground level as possible in the spring , clear the debris into piles to reveal the ground surface and to accurately spot spray the shoots that will emerge two to three weeks later as soon as they have a small amount of new foliage this will kill the plant back into its root system using a small fraction of the poison required to spray whole bushes
