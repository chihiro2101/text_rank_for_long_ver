the opiliones are known for having exceptionally long legs relative to their body size ; however , some species are short-legged the most easily discernible difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen , the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad , so that the body appears to be a single oval structure other differences include the fact that opiliones have no venom glands in their chelicerae , so pose no danger to humans in short-legged species , this may not be obvious in more active species , spiracles are also found upon the tibia of the legs typical body length does not exceed , and some species are smaller than 1 & nbsp ; mm , although the largest known species , trogulus torosus ( trogulidae ) , grows as long as the leg span of many species is much greater than the body length and sometimes exceeds and to in southeast asia many species are omnivorous , eating primarily small insects and all kinds of plant material and fungi such a broad range is unusual in other arachnids , which are typically pure predators rather , they ingest small particles of their food , thus making them vulnerable to internal parasites such as gregarines in some species , males also exhibit post-copulatory behavior in which the male specifically seeks out and shakes the female 's sensory leg a unique feature of harvestmen is that some species practice parental care , in which the male is solely responsible for guarding the eggs resulting from multiple partners , often against egg-eating females , and cleaning the eggs regularly many species of harvestmen easily tolerate members of their own species , with aggregations of many individuals often found at protected sites near water these aggregations may number 200 individuals in the laniatores , and more than 70,000 in certain eupnoi gregarious behavior is likely a strategy against climatic odds , but also against predators , combining the effect of scent secretions , and reducing the probability of any particular individual being eaten some of these defenses have been attributed and restricted to specific groups of harvestmen particular patterns or color markings on harvestmen 's bodies can reduce detection by disrupting the animals ' outlines or providing camouflage within the genus leiobunum are multiple species with cryptic coloration that changes over ontogeny to match the habitat used at each life stage many species have also been able to camouflage their bodies by covering with secretions and debris from the leaf litter found in their environments some hard-bodied harvestmen have epizoic cyanobacteria and liverworts growing on their bodies that suggest potential benefits for camouflage against large backgrounds to avoid detection by diurnal predators some harvestmen have elaborate and brightly colored patterns or appendages which contrast with the body coloration , potentially serving as an aposematic warning to potential predators this mechanism is thought to be commonly used during daylight , when they could be easily seen by any predators other harvestmen may exhibit mimicry to resemble other species ’ appearances arachnids such as spiders practice this mechanism when threatened or even to avoid being eaten by female spiders after mating thanatosis is used as a second line of defense when detected by a potential predator and is commonly observed within the dyspnoi and laniatores suborders , with individuals becoming rigid with legs either retracted or stretched to deflect attacks and enhance escape , long-legged species – commonly known as daddy long-legs – from the eupnoi suborder , use two mechanisms losing legs and walking hard : effects of autotomy and different substrates in the locomotion of harvestmen in the genus prionostemma eupnoi individuals , more specifically sclerosomatid harvestmen , commonly use this strategy in response to being captured this is seen with multiple long-legged species in the leiobunum clade that either drop and run , or drop and remain motionless this is also seen when disturbing an aggregation of multiple individuals , where they all scatter multiple species within the laniatores and dyspnoi possess stridulation organs , which are used as animal communication and have also been shown to be used as a second line of defense when restrained by a predator defences of a neotropical harvestman against different levels of threat by the recluse spider harvestmen are well known for being chemically protected however , these chemical irritants are not able to prevent four species of harvestmen being preyed upon by the black scorpion bothriurus bonariensis ( bothriuridae ) these secretions contain multiple volatile compounds that vary among individuals and clades comparative study of the defensive behavior and morphology of the gland opening area among harvestmen ( arachnida , opiliones , gonyleptidae ) under a phylogenetic perspective an urban legend claims that the harvestman is the most venomous animal in the world , but possesses fangs too short or a mouth too round and small to bite a human , rendering it harmless ( the same myth applies to pholcus phalangioides and the cranefly , which are both also called a '' daddy longlegs '' ) none of the known species of harvestmen has venom glands ; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and not strong enough to break human skin despite being similar in appearance to , and often confused with , spiders , they are probably closely related to the scorpions , pseudoscorpions , and solifuges ; these four orders form the clade dromopoda indeed , one species discovered in china , mesobunus martensi , fossilized by fine-grained volcanic ash around 165 million years ago , is hardly discernible from modern-day harvestmen and has been placed in the extant family sclerosomatidae this is mainly due to their delicate body structure and terrestrial habitat , making them unlikely to be found in sediments whether both specimens belong to the same species is not definitely known while the two described nemastomoides species are currently grouped as dyspnoi , they look more like eupnoi
