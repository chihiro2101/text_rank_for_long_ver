although the bulk of unrecorded compact discs are actually used in the computing industry , they are still '' taxed '' to provide a revenue stream to the recording industry this is debatable , however : levies could be seen as not being an advance for fines , but rather , only intended to compensate for copies in the private sphere that are legally allowed in many jurisdictions a notable exception in europe is the uk , that does not allow private copies while the prime purpose of levy systems is to compensate authors , some part of the collected money is also used for general cultural funding purposes an implementation question that arises is whether the tax applies to any type of copyrighted work or is restricted to a limited field such as music if it is restricted then the issue arises of how to collect the tax on media which can also be used for other purposes the options include : collecting the tax on all media , regardless of the end use , and ignoring the injustice to purchasers with non-covered uses collecting the tax on all media but allowing purchasers to claim a refund for media applied to non-covered uses contrary fairness arguments although these complexities make the systems of levies are far from perfect they do have some advantages related to fairness in that since there is compensation for private copying whereas in countries where there is no levies , there is a substantial amount of copying taking place without any due compensation being made likewise , if one can not reprimand all people that are copying illegally and not compensating the music industry , this is also a faulty system it is theorized that such levy may be linked to a corresponding relaxation of copyright law , by permitting the recording of copyrighted works on media for which the tax has been paid the court found the tax legal even though it went to private sources because it served a public purpose in belgium a fee is charged on both blank media and recording equipment which is passed on to '' auvibel '' , which is in charge of distributing the funds a blank media levy was introduced in canada in 1997 , by the addition of part viii , '' private copying '' , to the canadian copyright act with the exception of the zero-rating exemption , the levy is collected regardless of the purchaser 's end use of the media in conjunction with the levy , the copyright act allows individuals to make copies of sound recordings for their own private , non-commercial use some argue that cria wanted to limit the scope of the private copying levy , given that it legalizes copying for the private use of the person making the copy , possibly regardless of whether the source is non-infringing or not the pirate party of canada , or the ppca , has called for the scrapping the levy , as there are plenty of non-piracy related uses for cds and it is unjust to punish canadians who do n't use them for these purposes non-commercial includes such things as resale not in the course of business , perhaps of normal use working copies which are no longer wanted it is unlikely to include resale of copies in bulk ; napster tried to use the section 1008 defense but was rejected because it was a business 102-780 ( i ) , august 4 , 1992 : '' in short , the reported legislation section 1008 would clearly establish that consumers can not be sued for making analog or digital audio copies for private noncommercial use '' bars copyright infringement action and provides for a royalty of 2 % of the initial transfer price for devices and 3 % for media thanks to a precedent established in a 1998 lawsuit involving the rio pmp300 player , most mp3 players are deemed '' computer peripherals '' and are not subject to a royalty of this type in the u.s currently there is no proper private copy exception in the united kingdom , there is only a narrow exception regarding broadcast time-shifting ( s70 ( 1 ) of the copyright , designs and patents act 1988 ( cdpa ) ) 5 ( 2 ) b of the infosoc directive via the copyright and rights in performance ( personal copies for private use ) regulations 2014 this provided an exception limited to the personal use , to the owners of a personal copy and with the exclusion of indirectly commercial uses they are unfair to consumers in that they are payable regardless of the use to which a levied device ( for example a hard disk ) is put and regardless of whether a user has already paid for the copies they store on a device
