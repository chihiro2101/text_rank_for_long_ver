rhodes used his wealth and that of his business partner alfred beit and other investors to pursue his dream of creating a british empire in new territories to the north by obtaining mineral rights from the most powerful indigenous chiefs the imperial factor was a double-edged sword : rhodes did not want the bureaucrats of the colonial office in london to interfere in the empire in africa this put him on a collision course with many in britain , as well as with british missionaries , who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from london contrary to what the british government and the public had been allowed to think , the rudd concession was not vested in the british south africa company , but in a short-lived ancillary concern of rhodes , rudd and a few others called the central search association , which was quietly formed in london in 1889 armed with the rudd concession , in 1889 rhodes obtained a charter from the british government for his british south africa company ( bsac ) to rule , police , and make new treaties and concessions from the limpopo river to the great lakes of central africa but three tswana kings , including khama iii , travelled to britain and won over british public opinion for it to remain governed by the british colonial office in london '' the british colonial office also decided to administer british central africa ( malawi ) owing to the activism of david livingstone trying to end the arab slave trade in may 1895 , its name was officially changed to '' rhodesia '' , reflecting rhodes 's popularity among settlers who had been using the name informally since 1891 despite occasional efforts to return his body to the united kingdom , his grave remains there still , '' part and parcel of the history of zimbabwe '' and attracts thousands of visitors each year he and others felt the best way to '' unify the possessions , facilitate governance , enable the military to move quickly to hot spots or conduct war , help settlement , and foster trade '' would be to build the '' cape to cairo railway '' rhodes wanted to expand the british empire because he believed that the anglo-saxon race was destined to greatness in his last will and testament , rhodes said of the english , '' i contend that we are the first race in the world , and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race i contend that every acre added to our territory means the birth of more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence it is said that he wanted to develop an american elite of philosopher-kings who would have the united states rejoin the british empire he believed that eventually the united kingdom ( including ireland ) , the us , and germany together would dominate the world and ensure perpetual peace according to magubane , rhodes was '' unhappy that in many cape constituencies , africans could be decisive if more of them exercised this right to vote under current law referring to the cape qualified franchise , '' with rhodes arguing that '' the native is to be treated as a child and denied the franchise i do not go so far as the member for victoria west , who would not give the black man a vote despite his support for what became the basis for the apartheid system , he is best seen as a cultural racism '' rhodes worked well with the afrikaners in the cape colony ; he supported teaching dutch as well as english in public schools rhodes advocated greater self-government for the cape colony , in line with his preference for the empire to be controlled by local settlers and politicians rather than by london he was n't so much a freak as a man of his time.rhodes and the white pioneers in southern africa did behave despicably by today 's standards , but no worse than the white settlers in north america , south america , and australia ; and in some senses better , considering that the genocide of natives in africa was less complete the casual observer : rhodes : '' the enigma of his close male personal relationships '' city press : '' rhodes and his sexuality '' robin brown , the secret society : cecil john rhodes ' plan for a new world order ( penguin : 2015 ) during the second boer war rhodes went to kimberley at the onset of the siege , in a calculated move to raise the political stakes on the government to dedicate resources to the defence of the city rhodes used his position and influence to lobby the british government to relieve the siege of kimberley , claiming in the press that the situation in the city was desperate although rhodes remained a leading figure in the politics of southern africa , especially during the second boer war , he was dogged by ill health throughout his relatively short life in december 2010 , cain mathema , the governor of bulawayo , branded the grave outside the country 's second city an '' insult to the african ancestors '' and said he believed its presence had brought bad luck and poor weather to the region in his second will , written in 1877 before he had accumulated his wealth , rhodes wanted to create a secret society that would bring the whole world under british rule '' rhodes envisioned a secret society to extend british rule worldwide , including china , japan , all of africa and south america , and indeed the united states as well : rhodes 's final will – when he actually did have money – was much more realistic and focused on scholarships a 2015 movement , known as '' rhodes must fall '' ( or rhodesmustfall on social media ) , began with student protests at the university of cape town that were successful in getting university authorities to remove the rhodes statue from the campus however , oxford university opted to keep the rhodes statue , despite the protests encyclopædia britannica , discussing his legacy , wrote of rhodes that he '' once defined his policy as 'equal rights for every white man south of the zambezi ' and later , under liberal pressure , amended 'white ' to 'civilized ' '' encyclopaedia britannica effects of the jameson raid on rhodes ’ s career as part of his legacy , on his death rhodes left a significant amount of money to be used to finance talented young scholars ( '' race '' was not a criterion ) at oxford currently , in oxford a number of those south african and zimbabwean recipients of funds from his legacy are campaigning for his statue to be removed from display in oxford when asked if there was any double standard or hypocrisy in being funded by the rhodes scholarship fund and benefiting from the opportunity , whilst at the same time , campaigning against the legacy of rhodes , one of the south african campaigners , ntokozo qwabe , replied that '' this scholarship does not buy our silence.there is no hypocrisy in being a recipient of a rhodes scholarship and being publicly critical of cecil rhodes and his legacy in june 2020 , amid the wider context of black lives matter protests , the governing body of oxford 's oriel college voted to remove the statue of rhodes the actual removal would not take place until at least january 2021 , when a commission set up by the college delivers its findings on the statue 's future , after which the college will need to apply for planning permission from the local council the will of cecil rhodes is the central theme in the science fiction book great work of time by john crowley , an alternative history in which the secret society stipulated in the will was indeed established its members eventually achieve the secret of time travel and use it to restrain world war i and prevent world war ii , and to perpetuate the world ascendancy of the british empire up to the end of the twentieth century
