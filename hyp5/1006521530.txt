he was also the last gaelic one , as the events of the norman invasion of 1169–1171 brought about the destruction of the high-kingship , and the direct involvement of the kings of england in irish politics by the time of ruaidrí 's death in 1198 , king henry ii of england had invaded ireland and given the part of it he controlled to his son john as a lordship when john was just ten years old in 1177 when john succeeded to the english throne in 1199 , he remained lord of ireland thereby bringing the kingdom of england and the lordship of ireland into personal union king richard ii of england made two journeys to ireland during his reign to rectify the situation ; as a direct result of his second visit in 1399 he lost his throne to henry bolingbroke john ( 1177–1216 ) first man to be made lord of ireland and established the precedent that that lord would also be king of england the title '' king of ireland '' was created by an act of the irish parliament in 1541 , replacing the lordship of ireland , which had existed since 1171 , with the kingdom of ireland the crown of ireland act 1542 established a personal union between the english and irish crowns , providing that whoever was king of england was to be king of ireland as well , and so its first holder was henry viii of england although richmond was made lord lieutenant , the king 's counsellors feared that creating a separate kingdom of ireland , with a ruler other than that of england , would create another threat like the king of scotland the papal bull '' ilius '' of 1555 conferring the title of king of ireland upon philip ii for a brief period in the 17th century , during the wars of the three kingdoms from the impeachment and execution of charles i in 1649 to the irish restoration in may 1660 , there was no 'king of ireland ' after the irish rebellion of 1641 , irish catholics , organised in confederate ireland , still recognised charles i , and later charles ii , as legitimate monarchs , in opposition to the claims of the english parliament , and signed a formal treaty with charles i in 1648 however , in 1649 , the rump parliament , victorious in the english civil war , executed charles i , and made england a republic , or '' commonwealth '' the parliamentarian general oliver cromwell came across the irish sea to crush the irish royalists , temporarily uniting england , scotland , and ireland under one government , and styling himself '' lord protector '' of the three kingdoms ( see also cromwellian conquest of ireland ) the effect was to create a personal union between the crown of ireland and the british crown , instead of the english crown by the terms of the acts of union 1800 , the kingdom of ireland merged with the kingdom of great britain , thus creating the united kingdom of great britain and ireland following the separation of most of ireland from that kingdom in 1922 , the remaining constituent parts were renamed the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland in 1927 , five years after the establishment of the irish free state in early december 1922 , most of ireland ( twenty-six of the country 's thirty-two counties ) left the united kingdom of great britain and ireland the king 's title in the irish free state was exactly the same as it was elsewhere in the british empire , being from 1922 to 1927 : '' by the grace of god , of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions beyond the seas king , fidei defensor , emperor of india '' and , from 1927 to 1937 : '' by the grace of god , of great britain , ireland and the british dominions beyond the seas king , defender of the faith , emperor of india '' the change in the king 's title was effected under an act of the parliament of the united kingdom called the royal and parliamentary titles act , 1927 , intended to update the name of the united kingdom as well as the king 's title to reflect the fact that most of the island of ireland had left the united kingdom the act therefore provided that '' parliament shall hereafter be known as and styled the parliament of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland instead of the parliament of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland '' and '' in every act passed and public document issued after the passing of this act the expression 'united kingdom ' shall , unless the context otherwise requires , mean great britain and northern ireland '' the times , 4 march 1927 according to the times , the '' imperial conference proposed that , as a result of the establishment of the irish free state , the title of the king should be changed to 'george v , by the grace of god , of great britain , ireland , and the british dominions beyond the seas king , defender of the faith , emperor of india despite a lack of change in his title , george v 's position as king of that country became separated from his place as king of the united kingdom ( as occurred with all the other british dominions at the time ) the british monarchy , specifically , continued and continues in northern ireland , which remains a part of the sovereign state that is the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland the restoration ( ireland ) was effected in 1660 without major opposition , charles ii being declared king on 14 may 1660 by the irish convention anne ( 1702–1714 ) the acts of union 1707 united the kingdom of england and kingdom of scotland to form the kingdom of great britain however , the kingdom of ireland remained a separate state george i ( 1714–1727 ) george ii ( 1727–1760 ) george iii ( 1760–1800 ) the acts of union 1800 , instituted in reaction to the irish rebellion of 1798 , created the united kingdom of great britain and ireland george v ( 1922–1936 ) ( the irish free state became a self-governing dominion of the british empire and subsequently , in 1931 , a legislatively independent country ) edward viii ( 1936 ) arguably george vi ( 1936–1949 ) , whose status was diminished ( see head of state of ireland ( 1936 to 1949 ) ) following the ireland act 1949 , only that part of ireland known as northern ireland remained part of a monarchy the king 's title in the irish free state , when it became a self-governing dominion of the british empire , and its constitutional successor from december 1936 to april 1949 , was the same as elsewhere in the british commonwealth , proclamation altering the style and titles appertaining to the crown , london , 13 may 1927 but it was unclear whether the president of ireland was head of state of ireland ( 1936 to 1949 ) or the king , george vi the changes in the royal style in the 20th century took into account the emergence of independence for the dominions from the imperial parliament of the united kingdom paul , 1968 , page 141 irish nationalism : a history of its roots and ideology , seán cronin , continuum , 1981 , page 255 while they were not in favour of a monarchy in itself , pearse and plunkett thought that if the rising were successful and germany won the first world war , they would insist on an independent ireland being a monarchy with a german prince as king , in the
