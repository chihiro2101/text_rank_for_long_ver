minister of the crown includes the welsh ministers statutory instruments act 1946 , section 1a , substituted by section 160 ( 1 ) and schedule 10 , paragraph 1 of the government of wales act 2006 and various acts provide that delegated legislation , although made by another person ( for example , the general dental council dentists act 1984 , section 45 ) , is also to be made by statutory instrument so , for example , an order providing for the transfer of contracts from one national health service body to another may only be notified to the affected bodies , power to make an order under section 95 ( 1 ) of the national health service act 2006 excluded from the requirement to use a statutory instrument by section 272 ( 3 ) ( b ) of that act and by-laws made by a local council may be publicised through an announcement in local newspapers most statutory instruments ( sis ) are subject to one of two forms of control by parliament , depending on what is specified in the parent act parliament 's control is limited to approving , or rejecting , the instrument as laid before it : it can not ( except in very rare cases ) amend or change it statutory instrument practice , table b a motion to annul a statutory instrument is known as a '' prayer '' and uses the following wording : any member of either house can put down a motion that an instrument should be annulled , although in the commons , unless the motion is signed by a large number of members , or is moved by the official opposition , it is unlikely to be debated , and in the lords such a motion is seldom actually voted upon anything done under the instrument whilst it was in force remains valid , and the government is free to make a new statutory instrument the parent act may require that the proposed statutory instrument be approved by both houses of parliament ( or , in the case of an instrument which relates to financial matters , by the house of commons only ) either : before it is made ( i.e the last time a draft statutory instrument subject to affirmative procedure was not approved by the house of commons was on 12 november 1969 when the house rejected four draft orders relating to parliamentary constituencies because of the extensive powers given to the government to amend primary legislation as part of the act , a special form of affirmative procedure has been introduced before making a remedial order , the government must lay a proposal before parliament for 60 days , during which time it will be considered and reported upon by the joint committee of both houses on human rights some statutory instruments are made under provisions of acts which allow the instrument to change the parent act itself , or to change other primary legislation henry viii clauses after the enactment of the nationality , immigration and asylum act 2002 ( which permitted the secretary of state to make changes using henry viii powers ) , the delegated powers and regulatory reform select committee of the house of lords issued a report concerning the use and drafting of such clauses , which its chairman remarked go '' right to the heart of the key constitutional question of the limits of executive power '' the joint committee may draw the attention of both houses to an instrument if it : imposes a cost on the public finances , requires payments of fees to a public authority , is made under powers which prevent it from being challenged in the courts , attempts to have retrospective effect ( i.e to change the law from a date before the date on which it is made ) when the parent act does not explicitly empower it to do so , makes an unexpected or unusual use of the powers conferred by the parent act , or it may be ultra vires ( outside the powers granted by the parent act , and so unlawful ) , requires further explanation , has been published or laid before parliament late , or appears to contain mistakes the house of lords merits of statutory instruments select committee considers the policy of statutory instruments and would draw the attention of the house of lords to a statutory instrument if it : is politically or legally important , is no longer appropriate due to changes in circumstances since the parent act was passed , implements european law inappropriately , or fails to achieve its intended purpose in addition , the house of commons may refer a statutory instrument to a standing committee for detailed debate on the merits of the legislation if a motion to annul ( in the case of an instrument subject to negative resolution ) or approve ( in the case of an instrument subject to affirmative resolution ) is made most acts of parliament stipulate that their provisions shall not come into force until a date to be fixed by one or more commencement orders made by the government , it is quite common for different parts of an act to be brought into force on different dates , and consequently for there to be several commencement orders many statutory instruments ( indeed , the largest group after those subject to the negative resolution procedure ) are not required to be laid before parliament at all , and are therefore not subject to any parliamentary control this would be the case if the government attempts to use delegated legislation for a purpose not envisioned by the parent act , or if the legislation is an unreasonable use of the power conferred by the act , or if pre-conditions imposed by the act ( for example , consultation with certain organisations ) have not been satisfied
