as a result , this teletext data is also able to be decoded and displayed on-screen as an overlay of the conventional tv picture ( though not on standard vhs machines ) newer vhs vcrs , depending upon their specification , offered a feature called s-vhs quasi-playback or super quasi-play back , abbreviated to sqpb sqpb lets basic vhs players view ( but not record ) s-vhs recordings , though reduced to the lesser vhs quality later model s-vhs vcrs offered a recording option called s-vhs et , which allowed svhs vcrs to record on vhs tape however , s-vhs cassettes also contain a higher grade and coercivity of tape stock to effectively record the higher video bandwidth offered by s-vhs jvc also introduced an s-vhs et ( super-vhs expansion technology ) system on its s-vhs consumer decks , allowing the use of normal vhs tapes for s-vhs recording , by slightly modifying the s-vhs recording specs while still retaining compatibility so that s-vhs et tapes could be played with non-et s-vhs vcrs technically , in s-vhs et mode , the recording circuit is altered with : change of the w/d clip level ( reducing the white clip level from 210 % in svhs to 190 % in svhs et ) change of the main emphasis characteristics ( changing the frequency responses ) change of the recording level ( y and c ) and recording current jvc video technical guide - video cassette recorder - hr-s9500 ntsc/pal/secam , march 1999 - retrieved from ( members only ) on january 9 , 2016 in the camcorder role , the smaller form s-vhs-c camcorder enjoyed limited success among home video users for most of these stations , while the u-matics that they had been using were being phased out , but digital video was still years away , s-vhs was used to record from the composite setups that were still in place for u-matic production combination dvd/vcr units rarely offered s-vhs format standard , only vhs digital camcorders generally outperform s-vhs-c units in most technical aspects : audio/video quality , recording time , lossless duplication , and form-factor s-vhs was jvc 's next generation video format designed to dominate the competing superbetamax format ( which already offered better-than-vhs quality ) in terms of video performance , ed-beta offered even greater luminance bandwidth than s-vhs â€“ 500 television lines ( tvl ) of horizontal resolution per picture height , versus s-vhs 's or laserdisc 's 420 tvl ; putting ed-beta nearly on par with professional digital video formats ( 520 tvl ) s-vhs was used in some tv stations for inexpensive '' on the spot '' camcorder capture of breaking news , however it was not suitable for multi-generational ( studio ) use however , older television sets lacked s-video or even any av inputs an adat machine recorded eight tracks of uncompressed audio material in 16-bit ( later 20-bit ) resolution these used s-vhs cassettes for 8-track and 24-track digital audio recording , at a significantly lower cost than their dash reel-to-reel digital recorders
