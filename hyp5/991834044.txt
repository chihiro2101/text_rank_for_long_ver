in the mid-19th century , karl marx presented a schema of stages of historical development , by introducing the notion that human nature was not constant and was not determinative of the nature of the social system ; on the contrary , he made it a principle that human behavior was a function of the social and economic system in which it occurred marx based his theory of economic development on the premise of developing economic systems ; specifically , over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones ( 2005 ) comparing economic systems in the twenty-first century , seventh edition , south-western college publishing , at approximately the same time , charles darwin developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small , random variations could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms ( '' speciation '' ) this was followed shortly after by the work of the american pragmatic philosophers ( peirce , james , dewey ) and the founding of two new disciplines , psychology and anthropology , both of which were oriented toward cataloging and developing explanatory frameworks for the variety of behavior patterns ( both individual and collective ) that were becoming increasingly obvious to all systematic observers the state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more '' modern '' framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues veblen saw the need for taking account of cultural variation in his approach ; no universal '' human nature '' could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviors that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule , rather than the exception he emphasised the conflict between '' industrial '' and '' pecuniary '' or ceremonial values and this veblenian dichotomy was interpreted in the hands of later writers as the '' ceremonial/instrumental dichotomy '' ( hodgson 2004 ) ; veblen saw that every culture is materially based and dependent on tools and skills to support the '' life process '' , while at the same time , every culture appeared to have a stratified structure of status ( '' invidious distinctions '' ) that ran entirely contrary to the imperatives of the '' instrumental '' ( read : '' technological '' ) aspects of group life penrose ( 1959 ) the theory of the growth of the firm offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry ) the current term in common use is economic development he based his theory on the assumption of usual macroeconomic equilibrium , which is something like '' the normal mode of economic affairs '' these authors have focused mostly on the issue of changes in technology and routines , suggesting a framework for their analysis the authors introduced the term 'steady change ' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of 'steady state ' popular in classical economics the change of environment causes the change of competitiveness of different economic entities and systems in recent years , evolutionary models have been used to assist decision making in applied settings and find solutions to problems such as optimal product design and service portfolio diversification they hypothesize and establish empirically that agricultural characteristics that were favorable to higher return to agricultural investment in the malthusian era triggered a process of selection , adaptation , and learning that increase the prevalence of long-term orientation among individuals in society they further establish the variations in these agricultural characteristics across the globe are associated with contemporary differences in economic and human behavior such as technological adoption , education , saving , and smoking a basic economic concept such as utility may be better explained in terms of a set of biological preferences that maximized evolutionary fitness in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one another argument is that humans have a poor intuitive grasp of the economics of the current environment which is very different from the ancestral environment humans , therefore , may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of free trade ( causing calls for protectionism ) , the value of capital goods ( making the labor theory of value appealing ) , and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development
