modern dry cleaning 's use of non-water-based solvents to remove soil and stains from clothes was reported as early as 1855 the use of highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions , resulting in government regulation of dry cleaners these solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power at this time , dry cleaning was carried out in two different machines—one for the cleaning process , and the second to remove the solvent from the garments much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed , and no solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere this system ensures that only small amounts of pce fumes are released at the end of the cycle the many oh groups bind water , leading to swelling of the fabric and leading to wrinkling , which is minimized when these materials are treated with tetrachloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents in terms of mechanism , dry cleaning selectively solubilizes stains on the article also , the binding of water molecules interferes with weak attractions within the fiber , resulting in the loss of the fiber 's original shape the usage of an effective solvent coupled with mechanical friction from tumbling effectively removes stains the density of perchloroethylene is around 1.7 g/cm 3 at room temperature ( 70 % heavier than water ) , and the sheer weight of absorbed solvent may cause the textile to fail under normal force during the extraction cycle unless the mesh bag provides mechanical support some need to be treated with spotting solvents — sometimes by steam jet or by soaking in special stain-remover liquids — before garments are washed or dry cleaned machines using hydrocarbon solvents require a wash cycle of at least 25 & nbsp ; minutes because of the much slower rate of solvation of solvent-soluble soils a dry cleaning surfactant '' soap '' may also be added this pure solvent rinse prevents discoloration caused by soil particles being absorbed back onto the garment surface from the 'dirty ' working solvent the extraction cycle begins by draining the solvent from the washing chamber and accelerating the basket to 350–450 & nbsp ; rpm , causing much of the solvent to spin free of the fabric until this time , the cleaning is done in normal temperature , as the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process in the early days of dry cleaning , large amounts of perchlorethylene were vented to the atmosphere because it was regarded as cheap and believed to be harmless after the drying cycle is complete , a deodorizing ( aeration ) cycle cools the garments and removes further traces of solvent , by circulating cool outside air over the garments and then through a vapor recovery filter made from activated carbon and polymer resins many machines use '' spin disk filters '' , which remove the muck from the filter by centrifugal force while it is back washed with solvent finally , the solvent passes through a polishing filter , which removes any soil not previously removed used filters are another form of waste as is waste water to enhance cleaning power , small amounts of detergent ( 0.5–1.5 % ) are added to the working solvent and are essential to its functionality a bar underneath the circle indicates that only mild cleaning processes is recommended with superior degreasing properties , it was often used for industrial workwear/overalls cleaning in the past the dry cleaning process involves charging a sealed chamber which is loaded with clothes using gaseous carbon dioxide from a storage vessel to approximately 200 to 300 psi as mentioned in the mechanisms section , dry cleaning utilizes both chemical and mechanical properties to remove stains this discharge does not occur in liquid carbon dioxide and the build-up of an electrical charge on the surface of the fabric attracts the dirt back on to the surface , which diminishes its cleaning efficiency machinery for use of supercritical co 2 is expensive—up to 90,000 more than a pce machine , making affordability difficult for small businesses some cleaners with these machines keep traditional machines on-site for more heavily soiled textiles , but others find plant enzymes to be equally effective and more environmentally sustainable accessed 2014-jan-22 the exposure to the solvents in a typical dry cleaner is considered far below the levels required to cause any risk it is among the more expensive solvents , but it is faster cleaning , lower temperatures , and quick dry times
