the main differences from english draughts are : the size of the board ( 10Ã—10 ) , pieces can also capture backward ( not only forward ) , the long-range moving and capturing capability of kings known as flying , and the requirement that the maximum number of men be captured whenever a player has capturing options in the starting position ( see illustration ) the pieces are placed on the first four rows closest to the players thumb the player with the light pieces moves first multiple successive jumps forward or backward in a single turn can and must be made if after each jump there is an unoccupied square immediately beyond the enemy piece one must play with the piece that can make the maximum number of captures a piece is crowned if it stops on the far edge of the board at the end of its turn ( that is , not if it reaches the edge but must then jump another piece backward ) crowned pieces , sometimes called kings , can move freely multiple steps in any direction and may jump over and hence capture an opponent piece some distance away and choose where to stop afterwards , but must still capture the maximum number of pieces possible the game is considered a draw when the same position repeats itself for the third time ( not necessarily consecutive ) , with the same player having the move each time these are extra rules accommodated in some tournaments and may vary : if , during 25 moves , there were only king movements , without piece movements or jumps , the game is considered a draw if there are only three kings , two kings and a piece , or a king and two pieces against a king , the game will be considered a draw after the two players have each played 16 turns before a proposal for a draw can be made , at least 40 moves must have been made by each player number 46 is at the left corner seen from the player with the light pieces the first computer draughts tournament took place in 1987
