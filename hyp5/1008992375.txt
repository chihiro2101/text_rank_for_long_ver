she attributed the poverty threshold as a measure of income inadequacy by taking the cost of food plan per family of three or four and multiplying it by a factor of three.in 1969 the inter agency poverty level review committee adjusted the threshold for only price changes seebohm rowntree ( 1871–1954 ) , a british sociological researcher , social reformer and industrialist , surveyed rich families in york , and drew a poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money '' necessary to enable families … to secure the necessaries of a healthy life '' , which included fuel and light , rent , food , clothing , and household and personal items he considered this amount to set his poverty line and concluded that 27.84 % of the total population of york lived below this poverty line using a single monetary poverty threshold is problematic when applied worldwide , due to the difficulty of comparing prices between countries the basic needs approach is one of the major approaches to the measurement of absolute poverty in developing countries '' david gordon 's paper , '' indicators of poverty and hunger '' , for the united nations , further defines absolute poverty as the absence of any two of the following eight basic needs : food : body mass index must be above 16 relative poverty means low income relative to others in a country : for example , below 60 % of the median income of people in that country relative poverty is thus a form of social exclusion that can for example affect peoples access to decent housing , education or job opportunities '' '' relative poverty reflects better the cost of social inclusion and equality of opportunity in a specific time and space '' '' once economic development has progressed beyond a certain minimum level , the rub of the poverty problem – from the point of view of both the poor individual and of the societies in which they live – is not so much the effects of poverty in any absolute form but the effects of the contrast , daily perceived , between the lives of the poor and the lives of those around them for example , if everyone in a country 's income doubled , it would not reduce the amount of 'relative poverty ' at all '' in 1958 , john kenneth galbraith argued , '' people are poverty stricken when their income , even if adequate for survival , falls markedly behind that of their community '' in 1965 , rose friedman argued for the use of relative poverty claiming that the definition of poverty changes with general living standards can be said to be in poverty when they lack the resources to obtain the types of diet , participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are customary , or are at least widely encouraged or approved , in the societies to which they belong ( page 31 ) the main poverty line used in the oecd and the european union is based on '' economic distance '' , a level of income set at 60 % of the median household income the term relative poverty can also be used in a different sense to mean '' moderate poverty '' & nbsp ; – for example , a standard of living or level of income that is high enough to satisfy basic needs ( like water , food , clothing , housing , and basic health care ) , but still significantly lower than that of the majority of the population under consideration '' like the poverty line calculation , using a single global monetary calculation for living income is problematic when applied worldwide guidance manual on calculating and visualizing the income gap to a living income benchmark prepared for the living income community of practice the committee on sustainability assessment ( cosa ) and kit royal tropical institute july 2020 additionally , the living income should be adjusted quarterly due to inflation and other significant changes such as currency adjustments the world bank notes that poverty and standard of living can be measured by social perception as well , and found that in 2015 , roughly one third of the world ’ s population was considered poor in relation to their particular society the living income community of practice was founded by the sustainable food lab , giz and iseal alliance to measure the gap between what people around the world earn versus what they need to have a decent standard of living , and find ways to bridge this gap a variation on the licop ’ s living income is the massachusetts institute of technology 's living wage calculator , which compares the local minimum wage to the amount of money needed to cover expenses beyond what is needed to merely survive across the united states in 2020 , in the united states , the poverty threshold for a single person under 65 was an annual income of us 12,760 ; the threshold for a family group of four , including two children , was us 26,200 living below the poverty threshold can have a major impact on a child ’ s education health issues commonly affect the extent to which one can continue and fully take advantage of his or her education there is much dispute over whether upward mobility that brings a child out of poverty may or may not have a significant positive impact on his or her education ; inadequate academic habits that form as early as preschool typically are unknown to improve despite changes in socioeconomic status in the past years and into the present government , the use of the poverty threshold has consequences for such programs like medicaid and the children 's health insurance program the benefits and qualifications for federal programs are dependent on number of people on a plan and the income of the total group the reduction of family poverty also has the highest decrease with medicaid over other public assistance programs from a 2013–2015 study , expansion states showed a smaller gap in health insurance between households making below 25,000 and above 75,000 expansion also significantly reduced the gap of having a primary care physician between impoverished and higher income individuals in terms of education level and employment , health insurance differences were also reduced furthermore , 44 % of individuals who are given transfer benefits ( other than social security ) in one year do not receive them the next over 90 % of americans who receive transfers from the government stop receiving them within 10 years , indicating that the population living below the poverty threshold is in flux and does not remain constant most experts and the public agree that the official poverty line in the united states is substantially lower than the actual cost of basic needs in particular , a 2017 urban institute study found that 61 % of non-elderly adults earning between 100–200 % of the poverty line reported at least one material hardship , not significantly different from those below the poverty line the cause of the discrepancy is believed to be an outdated model of spending patterns based on actual spending in the year 1955 ; the number and proportion of material needs has risen substantially since then studies measuring the differences between income before and after taxes and government transfers , have found that without social support programs , poverty would be roughly 30 % to 40 % higher than the official poverty line indicates
