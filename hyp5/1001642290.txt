thus the erection of one of the finest examples of romanesque architecture which followed was made possible by pilgrims to the declared relics and these tactile examples demonstrating the efficacy of prayers mary magdalene is the prototype of the penitent , and vézelay has remained an important place of pilgrimage for the roman catholic faithful , though the actual claimed relics were torched by huguenots in the 16th century the nave , which had been burnt once , with great loss of life , burned again in 1165 , after which it was rebuilt in its present form from the beginning , its tympanum was specifically designed to function as a spiritual defense of the crusades and to portray a christian allegory to the crusaders ' mission the art historian george zarnecki wrote , '' to most people the term romanesque sculpture brings to mind a large church portal , dominated by a tympanum carved with an apocalyptic vision , usually the last judgment thirty years before the vézelay tympanum was carved , pope urban ii planned on announcing his call for a crusade at la madeleine in 1095 , urban altered his plans and preached for the first crusade at the council of clermont , but vézelay remained a central figure in the history of the crusades it is appropriate , therefore , that vézelay 's portal reflect its place in the history of the crusades it is a depiction of the first pentecostal mission to spread the word of god to all the people of the world the figures in the tympanum who have not received the word of god are depicted as not fully human the vézelay lintel is , therefore , a political statement as well as a religious one vézelay 's political motivation becomes all the more apparent when compared with contemporary portal designs from other churches around france medieval art in addition , the two tympana are similar in that they follow the tradition of placing the exaggerated christ in the center of the image the goals of the two different tympana are reflected in their design ; autun is designed to frighten people back to church while vézelay is designed as a political statement to support the crusades in the eyes of the designers , they had received god 's grace and are thus pictured as fully human in every detail the crusader armies were made up of many different nationalities bound only by faith in the same god in reference to the turkish take-over of the holy lands , pope urban said , '' what a disgrace that a race so despicable , degenerate , and enslaved by demons should thus overcome a people endowed with faith in almighty god ! '' it is not difficult to see the parallel between the apostles ' mission of casting out demons , and the designer 's view of the crusaders ' mission of casting out '' a race & nbsp ; the central tympanum shows a benevolent christ conveying his message to the apostles , who flank him on either side it is another example of the typical romanesque christ the vézelay christ , however , is pictured contraposto with arms wide that is why the traditional romanesque christ , with its angry stare , was replaced at vézelay by a kind and welcoming christ with arms wide open in 1976 , after more than eight centuries , hugues delautre , one of the franciscan fathers previously in charge of servicing the vézelay sanctuary , discovered that not only the orientation axis of la madeleine , but also its internal structure , were determined according to the position of the earth relative to the sun to understand the meaning of this objective sign , father hugues delautre refers to the 12th-century texts ( suger , peter the venerable , honorius of autun ) that inhabit the monument with the symbolic mentality of that time , for which sense reveals itself from sensitive signs through the anagogical method ( literally ascent towards the uncreated ) , and where one 's gaze is invited to go beyond the reality of the sign to reach the invisible , i.e letting himself be progressively informed by the vézelay light , he so concludes : : has not the builder , fascinated by the beauty of the universe which he recognises as the work of god , erected this vestibule to heaven in imitation of god who created with order , measure and beauty ? he could say as solomon did when he constructed the temple in jerusalem exactly according to god 's instructions : thou hast given command to build a temple on thy holy mountain the nave is the expression of the romanesque man 's admiring submission to the divine plan testified to by all creation
