the iasc was founded as a result of an agreement between accountancy bodies in the following countries : camfferman , k in 1977 , the iasc 's constitution was changed to allow for the appointment of two additional board members for four-year terms , on a rotating basis in a further change to the constitution in 1982 , the terms of all board members were limited to five years the iasc 's constitution as revised in 1982 provided for a limited expansion of the board 's membership beyond the organized accountancy profession up to four organizations having an interest in financial reporting could now be invited to be represented on the board as a result , three non-auditor delegations were added over time , all remaining on the board until the end of the iasc : 1986 : the international co-ordinating committee of financial analysts associations ( since 1988 known as the international council of investment associations ) steering committee membership was on an individual , not institutional , basis , but appointment was based on recommendation by an iasc member body , industry organization or similar grouping starting with ias 1 disclosure of accounting policies , published in 1975 , the iasc issued 41 international accounting standards , each dealing with a specific financial reporting topic ias 3 consolidated financial statements and the equity method of accounting ( 1976 ) required the presentation of consolidated financial statements by parents of subsidiary companies this was well before the seventh company law directive ( 1983 ) made this mandatory in the member states of the european economic community ias 17 accounting for leases ( 1982 ) required the capitalization of finance leases , a practice that was as yet unusual or unknown outside the united states as us capital markets were among the most important in the world , this meant above all that the iasc had to bring its standards more in line with us generally accepted accounting principles ( us gaap ) in order to gain acceptance by the us securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , a key iosco member this 'core standards ' programme was completed under strong time pressure in 1998 with the publication of ias 39 financial instruments : recognition and measurement according to the iasc 's constitution , the member bodies were committed to use their 'best endeavours ' with reporting companies , their auditors , governments and securities market regulators to ensure that published financial statements complied with ias , and that audit reports referred to any non-compliance in the early 1980s , a number of canadian listed companies began to assert compliance with ias in their financial statements , but this seems to have been the case in few other countries one explanation of this limited direct impact is that in most countries , national accountancy bodies had no authority to force companies to adopt ias during the 1990s , a number of major european companies began to prepare financial statements on the basis of us gaap because of actual or planned listings in the united states in 1998 , german companies were allowed to satisfy their legal reporting requirements in germany by publishing consolidated financial statements based on 'internationally recognized principles of accounting ' , which in practice meant either us gaap or ias
