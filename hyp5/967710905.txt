thumb smpte timecode is presented in hour : minute : second : frame format and is typically represented in 32 bits using binary coded decimal more complex timecodes such as vertical interval timecode can also include extra information in a variety of encodings in some applications wall-clock time is used , in others the time encoded is a notional time with more arbitrary reference practical systems watch the ascending sequence of the timecode and infer the time of the current frame from that as timecodes in analog systems are prone to bit-errors and drop-outs , most timecode processing devices check for internal consistency in the sequence of timecode values and use simple error correction schemes to correct for short error bursts to minimize subcarrier visibility on a monochrome receiver it was necessary to make the color subcarrier an odd multiple of half the line scan frequency ; the multiple originally chosen was 495 this latter change could have been achieved by raising the sound intercarrier by 0.1 % to 4.5045 & nbsp ; mhz , but the designers , concerned that this might cause problems with some existing receivers , decided instead to reduce the color subcarrier frequency , and thus both the line scan frequency and the frame rate , by 0.1 % instead in spite of what the name implies , no video frames are dropped or skipped when using drop-frame timecode central sync generators usually derive their timing from an atomic clock , using either network time or gps a frame rate of 30 & nbsp ; frame/s is often used for audio in america , japan , and other countries that rely on a 60 & nbsp ; hz mains frequency and use the ntsc television standard timecode may be attached to a recording media in a number of different ways to read ltc , the recording must be moving , meaning that ltc is useless when the recording is stationary or nearly stationary
