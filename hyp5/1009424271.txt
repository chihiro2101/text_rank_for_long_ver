( a conditioned response may occur after only one pairing usually the conditioned response is similar to the unconditioned response , but sometimes it is quite different pavlov reported many basic facts about conditioning ; for example , he found that learning occurred most rapidly when the interval between the cs and the appearance of the us was relatively short it was also thought that repeated pairings are necessary for conditioning to emerge , but many crs can be learned with a single trial , especially in fear conditioning and taste aversion learning two common forms of forward conditioning are delay and trace conditioning backward conditioning occurs when a cs immediately follows a us unlike the usual conditioning procedure , in which the cs precedes the us , the conditioned response given to the cs tends to be inhibitory this then makes it temporal conditioning as it would appear that the mouse is conditioned to the passage of time a single cs-us pairing may suffice to yield a cr on a test , but usually a number of pairings are necessary and there is a gradual increase in the conditioned response to the cs the speed of conditioning depends on a number of factors , such as the nature and strength of both the cs and the us , previous experience and the animal 's motivational state if the cs is presented without the us , and this process is repeated often enough , the cs will eventually stop eliciting a cr external inhibition may be observed if a strong or unfamiliar stimulus is presented just before , or at the same time as , the cs these procedures are the following : reacquisition : if the cs is again paired with the us , a cr is again acquired , but this second acquisition usually happens much faster than the first one reinstatement : if the us used in conditioning is presented to a subject in the same place where conditioning and extinction occurred , but without the cs being present , the cs often elicits a response when it is tested later latent inhibition refers to the observation that it takes longer for a familiar stimulus to become a cs than it does for a novel stimulus to become a cs , when the stimulus is paired with an effective us this is one of the most common ways to measure the strength of learning in classical conditioning ( slow pressing indicates a '' fear '' conditioned response , and it is an example of a conditioned emotional response ; see section below if conditioned inhibition has occurred , the rate of acquisition to the previous cs− should be less than the rate of acquisition that would be found without the phase 2 treatment the blocking effect is observed in a lack of conditional response to cs2 , suggesting that the first phase of training blocked the acquisition of the second cs according to pavlov , conditioning does not involve the acquisition of any new behavior , but rather the tendency to respond in old ways to new stimuli the model predicts a number of important phenomena , but it also fails in important ways , thus leading to a number of modifications and alternative models however , because much of the theoretical research on conditioning in the past 40 years has been instigated by this model or reactions to it , the r–w model deserves a brief description here the rescorla-wagner model argues that there is a limit to the amount of conditioning that can occur in the pairing of two stimuli however , after conditioning , the subject is no longer surprised , because the cs predicts the coming of the us ( note that the model can be described mathematically and that words like predict , surprise , and expect are only used to help explain the model that is , the us is fully predicted , the associative strength of the cs stops growing , and conditioning is complete the associative process described by the r–w model also accounts for extinction ( see '' procedures '' above ) the extinction procedure starts with a positive associative strength of the cs , which means that the cs predicts that the us will occur the most important and novel contribution of the r–w model is its assumption that the conditioning of a cs depends not just on that cs alone , and its relationship to the us , but also on all other stimuli present in the conditioning situation in particular , the model states that the us is predicted by the sum of the associative strengths of all stimuli present in the conditioning situation in blocking ( see '' phenomena '' above ) , cs1 is paired with a us until conditioning is complete finally cs2 is tested and shown to produce no response because learning about cs2 was “ blocked ” by the initial learning about cs1 since there is no difference between what is predicted and what happens , no new learning happens on the additional trials with cs1+cs2 , hence cs2 later yields no response one of the main reasons for the importance of the r–w model is that it is relatively simple and makes clear predictions tests of these predictions have led to a number of important new findings and a considerably increased understanding of conditioning some new information has supported the theory , but much has not , and it is generally agreed that the theory is , at best , too simple among these are two phenomena described earlier in this article latent inhibition : if a subject is repeatedly exposed to the cs before conditioning starts , then conditioning takes longer recovery of responding after extinction : it appears that something remains after extinction has reduced associative strength to zero because several procedures cause responding to reappear without further conditioning latent inhibition might happen because a subject stops focusing on a cs that is seen frequently before it is paired with a us in fact , changes in attention to the cs are at the heart of two prominent theories that try to cope with experimental results that give the r–w model difficulty in one of these , proposed by nicholas mackintosh , the speed of conditioning depends on the amount of attention devoted to the cs , and this amount of attention depends in turn on how well the cs predicts the us as stated earlier , a key idea in conditioning is that the cs signals or predicts the us ( see '' zero contingency procedure '' above ) however , for example , the room in which conditioning takes place also '' predicts '' that the us may occur still , the room predicts with much less certainty than does the experimental cs itself , because the room is also there between experimental trials , when the us is absent to find out what has been learned , we must somehow measure behavior ( '' performance '' ) in a test situation however , as students know all too well , performance in a test situation is not always a good measure of what has been learned as for conditioning , there is evidence that subjects in a blocking experiment do learn something about the '' blocked '' cs , but fail to show this learning because of the way that they are usually tested '' comparator '' theories of conditioning are '' performance based '' , that is , they stress what is going on at the time of the test an organism 's need to predict future events is central to modern theories of conditioning as noted above , this makes it hard for the model to account for a number of experimental results more flexibility is provided by assuming that a stimulus is internally represented by a collection of elements , each of which may change from one associative state to another for example , the similarity of one stimulus to another may be represented by saying that the two stimuli share elements in common also , different elements within the same set may have different associations , and their activations and associations may change at different times and at different rates element activity can only change in this way ; in particular , elements in a2 can not go directly back to a1 ) with repeated cs-us trials , more and more elements are associated , and more and more us elements go to a2 when the cs comes on one might say that the us is “ fully predicted ” or “ not surprising ” because almost all of its elements can only enter a2 when the cs comes on , leaving few to form new associations for example , unlike most other models , sop takes time into account the rise and decay of element activation enables the model to explain time-dependent effects such as the fact that conditioning is strongest when the cs comes just before the us , and that when the cs comes after the us ( “ backward conditioning ” ) the result is often an inhibitory cs the direct projections are sufficient for delay conditioning , but in the case of trace conditioning , where the cs needs to be internally represented despite a lack of external stimulus , indirect pathways are necessary '' flooding '' usually involves actual exposure to the stimuli , whereas the term '' implosion '' refers to imagined exposure , but the two terms are sometimes used synonymously for example , if a drug causes the body to become less sensitive to pain , the compensatory conditioned reaction may be one that makes the user more sensitive to pain for example , if the drug has always been administered in the same room , the stimuli provided by that room may produce a conditioned compensatory effect ; then an overdose reaction may happen if the drug is administered in a different location where the conditioned stimuli are absent some general examples that involve the classical conditioning theory in action include , in a lot of cases , advertising another example , very similar to pavlov 's experiment , involves food
