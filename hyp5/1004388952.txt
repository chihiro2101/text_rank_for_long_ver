box and garrick instantly formed a songwriting partnership and , having higher musical aspirations than their colleagues , decided to give up their day jobs and go professional from the very beginning , spice avoided playing covers and , according to box , always strove '' '' managed initially by newton 's father , the band climbed their way up to the marquee level , then got signed by gerry bron ( the hit record productions ltd '' i thought they were a band i could develop and i took them on that basis , '' remembered bron later '' we 'd actually recorded half the first album when we decided that keyboards would be good for our sound hensley had little to contribute to the debut : box and byron wrote most of the material , including '' gypsy '' , in many ways ( according to blows ) '' the debut was not popular with rock critics ( especially in the usa where rolling stone reviewer melissa mills infamously promised to commit suicide '' if this band makes it '' ) but in retrospect the attitude towards it changed in the course of the album 's making the writing relationship between box , byron and hensley was beginning to develop produced by gerry bron , the second album went a long way to ( according to allmusic ) perfect uriah heep 's '' blend of heavy metal power and prog rock complexity '' and was also significant for ken hensley 's instant rise to the position of main songwriter with him the band toured germany in late december 1970/january 1971 and made their first us tour in the spring of 1971 , supporting three dog night and steppenwolf '' it was the point in time when the band really found a solid musical direction , '' said bron later among the stand-outs were the title track , '' tears in my eyes '' and '' july morning '' , an epic many heep fans regard as equal to led zeppelin 's '' stairway to heaven '' and deep purple 's '' child in time '' '' i think that 'july morning ' is one of the best examples of the way the band was developing at that point in time newton recalled in a 2000 interview on uriah heep 's website his departure : '' well , as you know , my father managed the band in the early days , with the gods and spice anyway , with the heavy work schedules and the pressures and so on , i ended up collapsing on stage one night and the other members of the band decided i should go '' gary just had a style about him , it was incredible because every bass player in the world that i 've ever known has always loved his style , with those melodic bass lines , '' box later said while its title and roger dean 's sleeve both suggested that the band was romantically working medieval myth into their songs—and surely songs like '' rainbow demon '' and '' the wizard '' ( co-written by mark clarke , during his short stay ) did have thematic links with fantasy world—a more straightforward , hard-rocking approach was also apparent ken hensley meanwhile had been gradually recording his own , mellower material ; his solo debut proud words on a dusty shelf was released the same year box remembered weeks spent in the studio as '' dramatic '' for all the wrong reasons according to blows , '' a strenuous touring schedule , compounded by the bassist 's heavy drug dependency ( inherent even before joining heep ) was taking its toll , though matters came to a head while on tour during september , '' when the bassist received a serious electric shock on stage in dallas during a gig at southern methodist university ’ s moody coliseum on 15 september 1974 soon after going out of hospital , thain , in sounds , openly accused manager gerry bron of having turned uriah heep into a mere '' financial thing '' and was fired two months after the group 's final gig of 1974 at new theatre in oxford , england on 14 december it was when the show started to come second that the problems began , '' hensley remembered hensley later explained , '' when he joined , we thought that we could replace a great bass player ( thain ) with another great bass player , but we ignored the personality factor , which is crucial box later said , '' image-wise he was n't quite what we were looking for , but his pipes were perfect and so we went for the music end of it blows ) , '' a new vigour and confidence '' ( according to a record mirror review ) and also the new singer 's abilities : the latter ( according to allmusic ) , although lacking the multi-octave range of david byron , '' …boasted an impressive and emotionally rich hard rock voice that instantly jelled with the uriah heep sound '' the single '' free me '' ( whose '' acoustic style and accent on harmonies brought the group dangerously close to eagles territory , '' according to allmusic ) became an international hit '' for some time during this period , there were three uriah heep singles sitting together in the german top 20 , these being '' wise man '' ( from firefly ) , '' lady in black '' and '' free me '' in the end of 1978 , fallen angel came out , having completed a hat-trick of studio albums to feature a consistent lineup ( only the second time in their career that they had done so ) '' too poppy '' for mick box 's liking ( but still , '' too eccentric to fit the bill of an aor record , '' according to allmusic ) , it was well received at the time ( sounds gave it 4 stars ) but failed to chart blows writes , '' the combination of constant friction between the two ( resulting in the nearest thing to violence the group had seen ) and the constant presence of lawton 's wife on the road finally led to the vocalist getting the chop , shortly after playing the bilzen festival in belgium in august 1979 conquest lp was released in february 1980 ( worldwide except the united states , where it was never released ) and received 5 stars from record mirror , but , according to box , '' was a difficult album to record '' and represented '' a confused heep , '' even '' a mess '' ( in the words of trevor bolder ) then john sinclair came in whom box knew from the times he was a member of heavy metal kids and who currently played with a los angeles band called lion produced by ashley howe , the abominog album ( according to blows ) was , '' …important…in the way it pulled heep out of the seventies and thrust them into the eighties with determination muscle , '' even if sounded a bit too american sounds gave it a five star review , the newly established rock magazine kerrang ! declared it '' the most mature and perhaps best album of their career '' and in retrospect it is still seen as '' one of the most consistent and engaging albums in the group 's lengthy catalog head first ( may 1983 ) , produced again by ashley howe ( who , according to goalby , became '' like the sixth member of the band '' ) , followed much in the same vein , pursuing ( according to allmusic ) '' both albums , abominog and head first , updated the band 's sound and generated a brief , newfound interest in uriah heep among younger heavy metal fans '' by this time gerry bron was uriah heep manager no longer ( they were looked after by neil warnock in europe and blue oyster cult 's management team in the us ) and then , finally , bronze records collapsed under the weight of debts , which , according to box , '' '' massive asian and south american tours followed before the band returned to the studio with producer tony platt and a new deal with cbs 's portrait label secured by new manager harry maloney american singer steff fontaine , formerly of christian metal band joshua , joined in july 1986 but he was criticised for being totally '' unprofessional '' ( he missed , for some reason , a san francisco gig ) and was sacked in september 1986 after just one american tour shaw '' felt honoured at being invited to join such a legendary band '' while for box '' it was like everything falling into place in december 1987 they became the first ever western rock band to play in the soviet union , under mikhail gorbachev 's policy of glasnost ( western pop acts boney m , cliff richard , nitty gritty dirt band and elton john had already played shows there in the late 70s during the pre-gorbachev era ) at moscow 's olympic stadium the band played ten consecutive nights to a total of 180,000 people ( following a reception that bernie shaw remembered as being '' something like beatlemania '' ) , which was represented in the international press as not just an achievement for uriah heep but a major breakthrough for western music in general produced by trevor bolder and released early in 1991 , different world got a mixed reception from the press ( put down in kerrang ! , hailed in metal hammer ) and sold poorly still , the first half of the 1990s is regarded even by the heep fans as '' the wilderness years in late march/early april 1995 , the band 's former singer , john lawton , briefly rejoined uriah heep for two weeks to tour south africa and austria with deep purple , filling in for bernie shaw , who was suffering from voice problems at the time – allmusic was well received and in retrospect is seen as the band 's return to form , the key to success being ( according to critic donald a , had '' a grand , epic tone throughout '' that , according to rock critic steve huey , '' does n't always match uriah heep 's journeyman-sounding prog-tinged hard rock , still being a solid entry in its chosen genre '' a reunion gig with ken hensley & john lawton took place in london on 7 december 2001 in the course of the magicians birthday party , which since then became a tradition , even though hensley never actually joined again in march of that year the band recruited russell gilbrook as their new drummer and immediately started recording a new studio album entitled wake the sleeper , where they used double drums in the songs wake the sleeper and war child on 25 september , they announced the release of their greatest hits album totally driven , a collection of re-recordings of classic heep songs made in 2001 , which was released on 12 november 2016 also saw the group play a few japanese dates and the legends rock cruise the album was released on 14 september 2018 , and the band was set to embark on a world tour in support of it that would take them into 2019
