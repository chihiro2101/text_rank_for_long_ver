gao/ggd-00-67r questions concerning ltcm and our responses general accounting office , february 23 , 2000 tyler cowen concludes that '' creditors came to believe that their loans to unsound financial institutions would be made good by the fed â€” as long as the collapse of those institutions would threaten the global credit system '' financial bailouts of lending institutions by governments , central banks or other institutions can encourage risky lending in the future if those that take the risks come to believe that they will not have to carry the full burden of potential losses lending institutions need to take risks by making loans , and the riskiest loans usually have the potential for making the highest return he wrote that '' the risks inherent in mortgage lending became so widely dispersed that no one was forced to worry about the quality of any single loan thus , there is no one person responsible for verifying that any one particular loan is sound , that the assets securing that one particular loan are worth what they are supposed to be worth , that the borrower responsible for making payments on the loan can read and write the language in which the papers that he/she signed were written , or even that the paperwork exists and is in good order in the sub-prime crisis , however , national credit authorities ( the federal reserve in the us ) assumed the ultimate risk on behalf of the citizenry at large many scholars and journalists have argued that moral hazard played a role in the 2008 financial crisis , since numerous actors in the financial market may have had an incentive to increase their exposure to risk therefore , asset managers may have been in a situation of moral hazard , where they would take on more risk than appropriate for a given client because they did n't bear the cost of failure this belief may have been shaped by the 1998 bailout of long term capital management '' too big to fail '' banks may have believed they were essentially invincible to failure , thus putting them in a position of moral hazard : they could take on big risks - thus increasing their expected payoff - thinking that the federal government would bail them out in the event of a major failure therefore , large banks may have been in a situation of moral hazard , because they did n't bear the costs of a catastrophic collapse notably , the financial crisis inquiry commission ( fcic ) , tasked by congress with investigating the causes of the financial crisis , cited moral hazard as a component of the crisis , arguing that many factors , including deregulation in the derivatives market in 2000 , reduced federal oversight , and the potential for government bailout of '' too big to fail '' institutions all played a role in increasing moral hazard in the years leading up to the collapse third , some have argued that negative externality from corporate governance were a more important cause , since some risky investments may have had positive expected payoff for the firm but negative expected payoff to society however , since insurance companies can not perfectly observe their clients ' actions , they are discouraged from providing the amount of protection that would be provided in a world with perfect information economists distinguish moral hazard from adverse selection , another problem that arises in the insurance industry , which is caused by hidden information , rather than hidden actions the same underlying problem of non-observable actions also affects other contexts besides the insurance industry it also arises in banking and finance : if a financial institution knows it is protected by a lender of last resort , it may make riskier investments than it would in the absence of the protection in insurance markets , moral hazard occurs when the behavior of the insured party changes in a way that raises costs for the insurer since the insured party no longer bears the full costs of that behavior because individuals no longer bear the cost of medical services , they have an added incentive to ask for pricier and more elaborate medical service , which would otherwise not be necessary in those instances , individuals have an incentive to over consume , simply because they no longer bear the full cost of medical services a second type of behavior that may change is the reaction to the negative consequences of risk once they have occurred and insurance is provided to cover their costs however , after medical insurance becomes available , some may ask an insurance provider to pay for the cost of medical treatment that would not have occurred otherwise thus , the insured have a financial incentive to avoid making a claim consider a potential case of moral hazard in the health care market caused by the purchase of health insurance this example shows numerically how moral hazard could occur with health insurance for example , in the case of a health insurance company insuring an individual during a specific time period , the final health of the individual can be thought of as the outcome the individual taking greater risks during the period would be ex-ante moral hazard whereas lying about a fictitious health problem to defraud the insurance company would be ex post moral hazard
