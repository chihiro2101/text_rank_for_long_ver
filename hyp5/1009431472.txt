from the age of 10 , burgoyne attended the prestigious westminster school , as did many british army officers of the time such as thomas gage with whom burgoyne would later serve burgoyne was athletic and outgoing and enjoyed life at the school where he made numerous important friends , in particular lord james strange unable to support his wife otherwise , burgoyne again sold his commission , raising Â£2,600 , which they lived off for the next few years burgoyne admired independent thought amongst common soldiers , and encouraged his men to use their own initiative , in stark contrast to the established system employed at the time by the british army in 1768 , he was elected to the house of commons for preston , and for the next few years he occupied himself chiefly with his parliamentary duties , in which he was remarkable for his general outspokenness and , in particular , for his attacks on lord clive , who was at the time considered the nation 's leading soldier on the outbreak of the american war , he was appointed to a command , and arrived in boston in may 1775 , a few weeks after the first shots of the war had been fired he participated as part of the garrison during the siege of boston , although he did not see action at the battle of bunker hill , in which the british forces were led by william howe and henry clinton the following year , having convinced king george iii and his government of carleton 's faults , burgoyne was given command of the british forces charged with gaining control of lake champlain and the hudson river valley the plan , largely of his own creation , was for burgoyne and his force to cross lake champlain from quebec and capture ticonderoga before advancing on albany , new york , where they would rendezvous with another british army under general howe coming north from new york city , and a smaller force that would come down the mohawk river valley under barry st leading what he believed was an overwhelming force , he saw the campaign largely as a stroll that would make him a national hero who had saved the rebel colonies for the crown he refused to heed more cautious voices , both british and american , that suggested a successful campaign using the route he proposed was impossible , as the failed attempt the previous year had shown underlining the plan was the belief that burgoyne 's aggressive thrust from quebec would be aided by the movements of two other large british forces under generals howe and clinton , who would support the advance however , lord germain 's orders dispatched from london were not clear on this point , with the effect that howe took no action to support burgoyne , and clinton moved from new york too late and in too little strength to be any great help to burgoyne having amassed an army of over 7,000 troops in quebec , burgoyne was also led to believe by reports that he could rely on the support of large numbers of native americans and american loyalists who would rally to the flag once the british came south burgoyne gained possession of the vital outposts of fort ticonderoga ( for which he was made a lieutenant-general ) and fort edward , but , pushing on , decided to break his communications with quebec , and was eventually hemmed in by a superior force led by american major general horatio gates this was the greatest victory the american forces had up to that point in the revolutionary war , and it proved to be the turning point in the war , as france entered into an alliance with the american patriots this was widely seen as revenge for the poor treatment that prisoners-of-war of the continental army had received while imprisoned he returned at once , with the leave of the american general , to defend his conduct and demanded but never obtained a trial although burgoyne at the time was widely held to blame for the defeat , historians have over the years shifted responsibility for the disaster at saratoga to lord germain , the secretary of state for the colonies germain had overseen the overall strategy for the campaign and had significantly neglected to order general howe to support burgoyne 's invasion , instead leaving him to believe that he was free to launch his own attack on philadelphia had it not been for his role in the american war of independence , burgoyne would most likely be foremost remembered today as a dramatist despite this , accounts of those that served under him , particularly that of corporal roger lamb , noted that burgoyne 'shunned no danger ; his presence and conduct animated the troops ( for they greatly loved their general ) '
