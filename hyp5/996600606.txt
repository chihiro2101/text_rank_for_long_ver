pyroelectricity can be visualized as one side of a triangle , where each corner represents energy states in the crystal : kinetic , electrical and thermal energies however , note that some piezoelectric materials have a crystal symmetry that does not allow pyroelectricity pyroelectricity is measured as the change in net polarization ( a vector ) proportional to a change in temperature the pyroelectric coefficient may be described as the change in the spontaneous polarization vector with temperature : : p_i \frac where p i ( cm −2 k −1 ) is the vector for the pyroelectric coefficient the first reference to the pyroelectric effect is found in writings by theophrastus ( c both william thomson in 1878 william thomson ( 1878 ) '' on the thermoelastic , thermomagnetic and pyroelectric properties of matter , '' philosophical magazine , series 5 , vol voigt ( 1897 ) '' versuch zur bestimmung des wahren specifischen electrischen momentes eines turmalins '' ( experiment to determine the true specific electric moment of a tourmaline ) , annalen der physik , vol all crystal structures belong to one of thirty-two crystal classes based on the number of rotational axes and mirror plane they possess that leave the crystal structure unchanged ( point groups ) of the thirty-two crystal classes , twenty-one are non-centrosymmetric ( not having a centre of symmetry ) if the sum of charge times distance for all elements of the basic cell does not equal zero the cell will have an electric dipole moment ( a vector quantity ) the dipole moment per unit volume is defined as the dielectric polarization if this dipole moment changes with the effect of applied temperature changes , applied electric field , or applied pressure , the material is pyroelectric , ferroelectric , or piezoelectric , respectively the ferroelectric effect is exhibited by materials which possess an electric polarization in the absence of an externally applied electric field such that the polarization can be reversed if the electric field is reversed the piezoelectric effect is exhibited by crystals ( such as quartz or ceramic ) for which an electric voltage across the material appears when pressure is applied similar to pyroelectric effect , the phenomenon is due to the asymmetric structure of the crystals that allows ions to move more easily along one axis than the others as pressure is applied , each side of the crystal takes on an opposite charge , resulting in a voltage drop across the crystal one group calculated that a pyroelectric in an ericsson cycle could reach 50 % of carnot efficiency , while a different study found a material that could , in theory , reach 84-92 % of carnot efficiency ( these efficiency values are for the pyroelectric itself , ignoring losses from heating and cooling the thin film , other heat-transfer losses , and all other losses elsewhere in the system )
