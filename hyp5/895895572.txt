brushaber 's contention was that statute enacting the tax violated the fifth amendment 's prohibition on the government taking property without due process of law and that the statute also violated due process by exempting certain kinds of income in an 8â€“0 decision ( justice james clark mcreynolds did not participate in the decision ) , the court held , in an opinion written by chief justice edward douglass white , that the sixteenth amendment removes the requirement that income taxes be apportioned among the states according to population ( article i , section 9 , clause 4 of the u.s the revenue act of 1913 , imposing income taxes that are not apportioned among the states according to each state 's population , is constitutional there can be no dispute that there was power by virtue of the amendment during that period to levy the tax , without apportionment , and so far as the limitations of the constitution in other respects are concerned , the contention is not open the court also held that the revenue act does not violate the fifth amendment 's prohibition against the government taking property without due process of law the court further held that the revenue act does not violate the uniformity clause of article i , section 8 of the u.s in brushaber the court noted that even before the sixteenth amendment was passed , the congress had authority to tax income if a particular income tax was a direct tax or was treated as a direct tax in the constitutional sense , that tax could be imposed ( after pollock but before the passage of the amendment ) only by apportionment among the states , according to their census populations tax law professor boris bittker and his co-authors have stated : as construed by the supreme court in the brushaber case , the power of congress to tax income derives from article i , section 8 , clause 1 , of the original constitution rather than from the sixteenth amendment ; the latter simply eliminated the requirement ( article i , section 9 , clause 4 of the us constitution ) that an income tax , to the extent that it is a direct tax , must be apportioned among the states moreover , in addition , the conclusion reached in the pollock case did not in any degree involve holding that income taxes generically and necessarily came within the class of direct taxes on property , but , on the contrary , recognized the fact that taxation on income was in its nature an excise the sixteenth amendment removed the need imposed by the pollock decision to determine whether an income tax in any particular case was required to be apportioned , as the congress could again ( after 1913 ) tax income from any source without having to apportion the tax according to population constitution ) changes the general rule that direct taxes are still required to be apportioned among the states by population for example , if the us congress were to enact a national property tax ( a property tax or other tax by reason of its ownership ) or a national capitation ( a poll tax or head tax ) , such taxes would be required to be apportioned
