britannic had a layout very similar to her sister ships however following the loss of titanic and the subsequent inquiries , several design changes were made to the remaining olympic class liner the final design allowed the ship to retain its signature features such as the iconic funnel layout , however , the changes included increasing the ship 's beam to to allow for a double hull along the engine and boiler rooms , and raising six out of the 15 watertight bulkheads up to b deck . a more obvious external change was the fitting of large crane-like davits , each powered by an electric motor and capable of launching six lifeboats which were stored on gantries ; the ship was designed to have eight sets of gantry davits but only five were installed before britannic entered war service , with the difference being made up with boats launched by manually operated welin-type davits as on titanic and olympic this design enabled all the lifeboats to be launched , even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list thus , 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats , more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry the names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designer regarding their size : olympic , titanic and britannic their sizes were so large that it was necessary to build the arrol gantry to shelter them , wide enough to span the two new building slips and allow two ships to be built at a time their designed speed was approximately 22 knots , well below that of the lusitania and mauretania , but still allowing for a transatlantic crossing of less than one week the madison daily leader 27 november 1911.retrieved 4 october 2018 las vegas optic : '' 1,000 foot ship may dock in new york '' , 21 november 1911.retrieved 4 october 2018 according to simon mills , owner of the britannic wreck , a copy of the harland and wolff order book held by the public record office of northern ireland ( proni ref : d2805/ship/1 ) dated october 1911 ( about six months before the titanic disaster ) already shows the name britannic at least one set of documentation exists , in which hingley 's discuss the order for the ship 's anchors ; this documentation states that the name of the ship is gigantic . reusing olympics space saved the shipyard time and money by not clearing out a third slip similar in size to those used for olympic and titanic the admiralty paid the companies for the use of their ships but the risk of losing a ship in naval operations was high the big ocean liners were not initially taken for naval use , because smaller ships were easier to operate in may 1915 , britannic completed mooring trials of her engines , and was prepared for emergency entrance into service with as little as four weeks ' notice the same month also saw the first major loss of a civilian ocean liner when cunard 's was torpedoed near the irish coast by . the four ships were joined a little later by statendam the transformation took place for several months before being interrupted by a recall of the ship back into military service the admiralty recalled the britannic back into service as a hospital ship on 26 august 1916 , and the ship returned to the mediterranean sea for a fourth voyage on 24 september of that year . life aboard the ship followed a routine at 8:30 pm , the patients went to bed and the captain made another inspection tour by next morning , the storms died and the ship passed the strait of messina without problems the reaction in the dining room was immediate ; doctors and nurses left instantly for their posts but not everybody reacted the same way , as further aft , the power of the explosion was less felt and many thought the ship had hit a smaller boat an sos signal was immediately sent out and was received by several other ships in the area , among them and hms heroic , but britannic heard nothing in reply this meant that , although the ship could still send out transmissions by radio , she could no longer receive them those measures had been taken after the titanic disaster ( titanic could float with only her first four compartments flooded ) as the ship 's angle of list increased , water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four with water also entering the ship 's aft section from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five , britannic quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to the weight of the water flooding into the starboard side the captain ordered the port shaft driven at a higher speed than the starboard side , which helped the ship move towards the island major harold priestley gathered his detachments from the royal army medical corps to the back of the a deck and inspected the cabins to ensure no one was left behind the other crew members began to fear that the list would become too large , and so they decided to put the first lifeboat onto the water without waiting for the order to do so before he could do so , two lifeboats were put onto the water on the port side at this point , bartlett concluded that the rate at which britannic was sinking had slowed so he called a halt to the evacuation and ordered the engines restarted in the hope that he might still be able to beach the ship realising that there was now no hope of reaching land in time , bartlett gave the final order to stop the engines and sounded two final long blasts of the whistle , the signal to abandon ship . as water had already reached the bridge , he and assistant commander dyke walked off onto the deck and entered the water , swimming to a collapsible boat from which they continued to coordinate the rescue operations '' when the britannic came to rest , she gained her title as the largest ship lost in the first world war and world 's largest sunken passenger ship compared to titanic , the rescue of britannic was facilitated by three factors : the temperature was higher compared to for titanic ) , more lifeboats were available ( 35 were launched and stayed afloat compared to titanics 20 and help was closer ( arrived less than two hours after first distress call compared to three and a half hours for titanic arrived at 11:45 and , after sweeping the area , anchored in the small port at 13:00 to offer medical assistance and take on board the remaining survivors in addition , the number of crews planned was increased from about 860 â€“ 880 on the olympic and titanic to 950 on the britannic children began to appear as part of the clientele that needed to be satisfied , and thus a playroom for them was built on the boat deck the most important addition was that of individual bathrooms in almost every first class cabin , which would have been a first on an ocean liner ( on the olympic and the titanic , most passengers had to use public bathrooms ) . these facilities were installed but were soon removed because the ship was converted to a hospital ship and were never re-installed because the ship sank before she could enter transatlantic service , so the planned facilities were either cancelled , destroyed , reused on other vessels ( like olympic ) , or just never used a welte-mignon was planned to be installed on board britannic but because of the outbreak of war , the instrument never made its way to belfast in filming the expedition , cousteau also held conference on camera with several surviving personnel from the ship including sheila macbeth mitchell , a survivor of the sinking despite this , the crew 's quarters in the forecastle were found to be in good shape with many details still visible the wreck lies in shallow enough water that scuba divers trained in technical diving can explore it , but it is listed as a british war grave and any expedition must be approved by both the british and greek governments using diver propulsion vehicles , the team made more man-dives to the wreck and produced more images than ever before , including video of four telegraphs , a helm and a telemotor on the captain 's bridge diver leigh bishop brought back some of the first photographs from inside the wreck and his diver partner rich stevenson found that several watertight doors were open a number of mine anchors were located off the wreck by sonar expert bill smith , confirming the german records of u-73 that britannic was sunk by a single mine and the damage was compounded by open portholes and watertight doors in 2006 , an expedition , funded and filmed by the history channel , brought together fourteen skilled divers to help determine what caused the quick sinking of britannic after preparation the crew dived on the wreck site on 17 september one last dive was to be attempted on britannics boiler room , but it was discovered that photographing this far inside the wreck would lead to violating a permit issued by the ephorate of underwater antiquities , a department within the greek ministry of culture on 24 may 2009 , carl spencer , drawn back to his third underwater filming mission of britannic , died in greece due to equipment difficulties while filming the wreck for national geographic having her career cut short in wartime , having never entered commercial service , and having had few victims , britannic did not experience the enthusiasm aroused upon the mention of her name , unlike that of her sister ship titanic after having been long ignored by the public , she finally gained fame when her wreck was discovered the loss of two of the olympic-class ships was a major blow to white star line
