family and early life according to anna 's description in the alexiad , her mother asked anna to wait to be born until her father returned from war the two were the heirs to the empire until sometime between c.1088 and 1092 , after the birth of anna 's brother , john ii komnenos various scholars point out that the betrothal was probably a political match intended to establish the legitimacy of anna 's father , who had usurped the previous emperor starting around 1090 , constantine 's mother – maria of alania – raised anna in her home some scholars argue that anna 's betrothal to constantine doukas may not have ended there , as he was not implicated in the plot against alexios , but it certainly ended when he died around 1094 for example , thalia gouma-peterson argues that irene doukaina 's '' maternal ability to deal with the speculative and the intellectual enables the daughter to become the highly accomplished scholar she proudly claims to be in the opening pages of the alexiad anna was noted for her education by the medieval scholar , niketas choniates , who wrote that anna '' was ardently devoted to philosophy , the queen of all sciences , and was educated in every field most scholars agree that the marriage was a political one – it created legitimacy for anna 's paternal family through bryennois ' connections to past emperor 's family several years after his birth , in 1092 , john was designated emperor anna also worked in her husband 's favor during her father 's illness anna 's '' main aim '' in the depiction of events in the alexiad , according to stankovich , was to '' stress her own right '' to the throne and '' precedence over her brother , john record that anna was '' almost certainly '' involved in the murder plot against john at alexios 's funeral , record that , a short time afterward , anna and bryennios '' organized another conspiracy in contrast , leonora neville argues that anna was probably not involved in the attempted usurpation anna plays a minor role in most of the available medieval sources – only choniates portrays her as a rebel instead , most of the sources question whether john ii komnenos ' behavior at his father 's deathbed was appropriate it can be assumed because of minor errors that she may have quoted homer and the bible from memory when writing her most celebrated work , the alexiad anna cited her husband 's unfinished work as the reason why she began the alexiad ruth macrides argues that while bryennios ' writing may have been a source of inspiration for the alexiad , it is incorrect to suggest that the alexiad was bryennios ' work edited by anna ( as howard-johnston has argued on tenuous grounds ) i based the truth of my history on them by examining their narratives and comparing them with what i had written , and what they told me with what i had often heard , from my father in particular and from my uncles … from all these materials the whole fabric of my history – my true history – has been woven '' in the alexiad , anna provided insight on political relations and wars between alexios i and the west anna herself also addressed these lapses , explaining them as a result of memory loss and old age catholic encyclopedia moreover , the alexiad sheds light on anna 's emotional turmoil , including her grief over the deaths of her father , mother , and husband , among other things at the end of the alexiad , anna wrote '' but living i died a thousand deaths … yet i am more grief-stricken than niobe : after my misfortunes , great and terrible as they are , i am still alive – to experience yet more … let this be the end of my history , then , lest as i write of these sad events i become even more resentful anna komnene plays a secondary role in walter scott 's 1832 novel count robert of paris fictional accounts of her life are given in the 1928 novel anna comnena by naomi mitchison , and the 1999 novel for young people anna of byzantium by tracy barrett ( retrieved august 2010 ) she is also a minor character in nan hawthorne 's novel of the crusade of 1101 , beloved pilgrim ( 2011 ) anna appears in medieval 2 : total war as a byzantine princess , under the name anna comnenus the novel includes considerable detail on anna komnene 's life , work , and historical context in the board game nations , anna komnene is an adviser in the medieval age peter frankopan , ( new york : penguin , 2009 ) georgios tornikes , 'an unpublished funeral oration on anna comnena ' , english translation by robert browning , in aristotle transformed : the ancient commentators and their influence , ed john france , '' anna comnena , the alexiad and the first crusade '' , reading medieval studies v paul stephenson , '' anna comnena 's alexiad as a source for the second crusade ?
