in cases of rhabdomyolysis , which is the rapid breakdown of muscle fibers , time to recovery is dependent on duration and intensity of original activity plus any excess activity during the recovery period ; muscle pain muscle pain from madd is not well understood , but is partially due to high levels of lactate madd causes an increase of free adenosine during heavy activity which may cause exercise-induced muscle pain though the body can manufacture some ribose and obtain more from rna-rich sources such as beans and red meat , this loss of ribose due to madd is sometimes sufficient to create a shortage in the body , resulting in symptoms of severe fatigue and muscle pain it may result in a reduction of the amount of fumarate available to the citric acid cycle , and it may result in lower levels of nitric oxide ( a vasodilator ) in the body , reducing blood flow and oxygen intake during vigorous exercise , though this may be offset by increased levels of adenosine , another vasodilator it may somehow result in a reduction in the amount of lactic acid produced by the muscles , though serum lactate is typically slightly elevated with madd it was demonstrated , that muscle cells , that lack ampd1 , stock and consume significantly more glutamate , and produce more alanine in this state , compared to healthy controls , which indicates occurrence of a higher concentration of pyruvate in the cell during exercise the pool of amp also grows bigger than in the controls , which would cause higher rate of glucose liberation from glycogen although probably unrelated to ampd deficiency , if the person happens to have a high load of d-lactate in the blood ( mostly from food and colonic fermentation ) , the precipitate , the lactate loss and the magnesium loss may occur even before l-lactate ( mostly from muscles ) reaches its renal re-absorption threshold it becomes hard to rapidly increase the load on a muscle , as in mcardle 's disease , and such a rapid load increase will dump even more purines into blood and urine ( looking like translucent or rust-colored sharp shiny crystals and being highly irritating ) the same situation would occur if blood flow to muscle cells becomes insufficient ( except that somewhat less amp is spilled over , and somewhat more of it is metabolized inside the muscle cell ) as the short-term regulation of atp production becomes very weak after the exhaustion of glycogen , the medium-term regulation becomes enabled , but with a progressively weaker authority at higher purine nucleotide energy charge levels , which causes some differences in symptoms compared to mcardle 's a load decrement may produce some sense of relief , though , if the pool of the citric acid cycle intermediates built up so far is sufficient to maintain full purine nucleotide energy charge at the lower load adenosine production and lack of ammonia overproduction seem to strongly suppress rhabdomyolysis down to the purine nucleotide energy charge level , where the cell is able to signal pain , or where individual muscle fibers start cramping ( fail to relax from contraction in sync with the rest of the muscle ) , or the whole muscle fails to contract ( when walking quickly downhill ) , allowing the person to appropriately modulate the exertion most of the amp probably spills into blood unchanged , and is gradually returned to the muscle cell , if its concentration there falls due to gradual recharge to atp thus , it may take the residual ampd activity less time to build up citric acid cycle intermediates , when the whole body is warmed up for an exercise at the same time , rather than a specific group of muscles needed in the exercise in case of leg muscles , where circulation is substantially dependent on their cyclical contraction when the body is upright , a small but useful degree of initial up-regulation of the citric acid cycle may be achieved just by standing still for a few minutes by sitting down , walking , or cycling ) , the ammonia , produced by the amplified residual ampd activity , may accumulate in the muscle cells and in the surrounding tissues to toxic levels , and may also indirectly affect other organs there is little or no warning for nearing toxicity , because the purine nucleotide energy charge is still relatively high , the leg muscles do not cramp , and remain functional in contrast , while muscle glycogen is available , accumulation of lactic acid in this situation would produce a noticeable sensation it probably happens because the digestive system senses and signals forthcoming delivery of sugars , inhibiting fatty acid release and oxidation , and starving glycogen-less muscle cells of the sole available source of energy at rest , however , the liver will effortlessly cover the whole body energy needs until absorption of carbohydrates occurs when a carbohydrate-rich food has been eaten before amp has been eliminated from muscle cells , when bulk absorption starts , plenty of glucose becomes available in the blood , is taken up by muscle cells , is added to the glycogen store , but then immediately becomes liberated by the still up-regulated myophosphorylase delayed stomach emptying creates especially favorable conditions for the shock lactic acidosis , because the digestive system may meanwhile still inhibit fatty acid release and oxidation , helping more muscles to run out of glycogen in those persons , who are otherwise still able to maintain its stores between meals it may be especially important to have adequate dietary iodine in the glycogen-less state , so that stomach emptying is not excessively delayed , the up-regulation of the citric acid cycle in muscle cells in response to a load increment is not too slow , and the muscles can each time accept a bigger load increment relative to the perceived effort
