in plant biology , pectin consists of a complex set of polysaccharides ( see below ) that are present in most primary cell walls and are particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants the amount , structure and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants , within a plant over time , and in various parts of a plant during fruit ripening , pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase , in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other pectin is a natural part of the human diet , but does not contribute significantly to nutrition a study found that after consumption of fruit the concentration of methanol in the human body increased by as much as an order of magnitude due to the degradation of natural pectin ( which is esterified with methyl alcohol ) in the colon pectin has been observed to have some function in repairing the dna of some types of plant seeds , usually desert plants the effect depends upon the source of pectin ; apple and citrus pectins were more effective than orange pulp fiber pectin isolated pectin has a molecular weight of typically 60,000–130,000 g/mol , varying with origin and extraction conditions the ratio of esterified to non-esterified galacturonic acid determines the behavior of pectin in food applications - hm-pectins can form a gel under acidic conditions in the presence of high sugar concentrations , while lm-pectins form gels by interaction with divalent cations , particularly ca 2+ , according to the idealized ‘ egg box ’ model , in which ionic bridges are formed between calcium ions and the ionised carboxyl groups of the galacturonic acid these bonds form as water is bound by sugar and forces pectin strands to stick together from these materials , pectin is extracted by adding hot dilute acid at ph-values from 1.5 – 3.5 after drying and milling , pectin is usually standardised with sugar , and sometimes calcium salts or organic acids , to optimize performance in a particular application for household use , pectin is an ingredient in gelling sugar ( also known as '' jam sugar '' ) where it is diluted to the right concentration with sugar and some citric acid to adjust ph in some countries , pectin is also available as a solution or an extract , or as a blended powder , for home jam making with low-ester pectins and amidated pectins , less sugar is needed , so that diet products can be made water extract of aiyu seeds is traditionally used in taiwan to make aiyu jelly , where the extract gels without heating due to low-ester pectins from the seeds and the bivalent cations from the water pectin is used in confectionery jellies to give a good gel structure , a clean bite and to confer a good flavour release pectin can also be used to stabilize acidic protein drinks , such as drinking yogurt , to improve the mouth-feel and the pulp stability in juice based drinks and as a fat substitute in baked goods typical levels of pectin used as a food additive are between 0.5 and 1.0 % – this is about the same amount of pectin as in fresh fruit sriamornsak revealed that pectin could be used in various oral drug delivery platforms , e.g it was found that pectin from different sources provides different gelling abilities , due to variations in molecular size and chemical composition like other natural polymers , a major problem with pectin is inconsistency in reproducibility between samples , which may result in poor reproducibility in drug delivery characteristics pectin was first sold as a liquid extract , but is now most often used as dried powder , which is easier than a liquid to store and handle
