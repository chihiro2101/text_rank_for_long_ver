in industry , edta is mainly used to sequester metal ions in aqueous solution in the pulp and paper industry , edta inhibits the ability of metal ions , especially manganese , from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , which is used in totally chlorine free in a similar manner , edta is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration , which is catalysed by metal ions us food and drug administration : center for food safety and applied nutrition questions and answers on the occurrence of benzene in soft drinks and other beverages the reduction of water hardness in laundry applications and the dissolution of scale in boilers both rely on edta and related complexants to bind calcium , magnesium , as well as other metal ions for similar reasons , cleaning solutions often contain edta the solubilisation of iron ions at or below near neutral ph can be accomplished using edta however , given the ph dependence of ligand formation , edta is not helpful for improving iron solubility in above neutral soils in similar manner , nitrogen oxides are removed from gas streams using fe ( edta ) 2− sodium calcium edetate , an edta derivative , is used to bind metal ions in the practice of chelation therapy , such as for treating mercury and lead poisoning edta is used extensively in the analysis of blood some alternative medicine believe edta acts as an antioxidant , preventing free radicals from injuring blood vessel walls , therefore reducing atherosclerosis in the laboratory , edta is widely used for scavenging metal ions : in biochemistry and molecular biology , ion depletion is commonly used to deactivate metalloenzymes , either as an assay for their reactivity or to suppress damage to dna , proteins , and polysaccharides in analytical chemistry , edta is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses in histopathology , edta can be used as a decalcifying agent making it possible to cut sections using a microtome once the tissue sample is demineralised edta is also known to inhibit a range of metalloproteinase , the method of inhibition occurs via the chelation of the metal ion required for catalytic activity edta can also be used to test for bioavailability of heavy metals in sediments the same study also found that both dermal exposure to edta in most cosmetic formulations and inhalation exposure to edta in aerosolised cosmetic formulations would produce exposure levels below those seen to be toxic in oral dosing studies at very low ph ( very acidic conditions ) the fully protonated h 6 edta 2+ form predominates , whereas at very high ph or very basic condition , the fully deprotonated edta 4− form is prevalent finally , since complexes of edta 4− are anionic , they tend to be highly soluble in water in many industrial wastewater treatment plants , edta elimination can be achieved at about 80 % using microorganisms some microorganisms have even been discovered to form nitrates out of edta , but they function optimally at moderately alkaline conditions of ph 9.0–9.5 ids binds to calcium exceptionally well and forms stable compounds with other heavy metal ions trisodium dicarboxymethyl alaninate , also known as methylglycinediacetic acid ( mgda ) , has a high rate of biodegradation at over 68 % , but unlike many other chelating agents can degrade without the assistance of adapted bacteria mgda has been shown to be an effective chelating agent , with a capacity for mobilization comparable with that of nitrilotriacetic acid ( nta ) , with application to water for industrial use and for the removal of calcium oxalate from urine from patients with kidney stones
