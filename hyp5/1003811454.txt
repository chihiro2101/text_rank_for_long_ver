before the adoption of the metric system , many systems of troy weights were in use in various parts of europe , among them holland troy , paris troy , etc troy weights were first used in england in the 15th century , and were made official for gold and silver in 1527 the troy ounce in use today is essentially the same as the british imperial troy ounce ( 1824â€“1971 ) , adopted as an official weight standard for united states coinage by act of congress on may 19 , 1828 the troy ounce and grain were also part of the apothecaries ' system the only troy weight in widespread use today is the british imperial troy ounce and its american counterpart the british empire abolished the 12-ounce troy pound in the 19th century , though it has been retained ( although rarely used ) in the american system ) an alternative suggestion is that the weights come from the muslim domains by way of the gold dirham ( 47.966 british imperial grains ) , in the manner that king offa 's weights were derived from the silver dirhem ( about 45.0 british grains ) troy ounces are still often used in precious metal markets in countries that otherwise use international system of units ( si ) , except in east asia specifically , it defined one pound as we can derive an exact value for the troy ounce as follows : :1 lb an avoirdupois pound also equals 7,000 grains ( the international yard and pound agreement did not change the grain values of non-metric units ) where once 240 pence made a tower pound ( and 256 make a troy pound ) , by the time of the weights and measures acts ( uk ) of 1824 , a troy pound gives 792 silver pence , still minted as such as maundy money
