the low pitch voice is a direct result of increased fluid in the reinke 's space , which vibrates at a lower frequency than normal ( females hoarseness is a common problem of many larynx diseases , such as laryngitis the symptoms of reinke 's edema are considered to be chronic symptoms because they develop gradually over time and depend on how long the individual is exposed to the risk factor additionally , the combination of several risk factors increase the likelihood of an individual developing reinke 's edema for example , an individual who smokes and also has gastric reflux would have an increased susceptibility for developing reinke 's edema over time females also report more physical discomfort due to reinke 's edema because the disease is heavily linked to smoking , there is no established way to screen for reinke 's edema by adopting a non-smoking lifestyle after being diagnosed with reinke 's edema , it is possible to stop the disease 's progression , although it is not possible to reverse it therefore , it is critical to maintain a non-smoking lifestyle even after surgery , because the fluid can re-emerge the pathophysiology or mechanism of reinke 's edema is not well known , however , chemicals contained within cigarette smoke are associated with an increased vascular permeability of blood vessels , which results in fluid leaking into the reinke 's space the advanced “ livid ” type of reinke 's edema is identified by an increased amount of fluid , accompanied by a color change from colorless to yellow-grey additionally , if the edema becomes too severe , patients may experience difficulty breathing due to airway obstruction flexible laryngoscopes , such as fiber laryngoscopes , allow the patient to produce sound as the tube is placed , and therefore allows the doctor to visualize movement of the vocal cord the use of rigid laryngoscopes generally requires general anaesthesia due to the discomfort involved in distracting the soft tissues of the mouth and pharynx in the case of reinke 's edema , structural changes to the vocal cords will result in abnormal wave patterns the first step in treating reinke 's edema is to eliminate or control those risk factors that are causing the disease if the elimination of risk factors is not sufficient to improve the patient 's symptoms , surgery may be required the most common type of surgery performed today for reinke 's edema is called surgical microlaryngoscopy the complication associated with removing tissue from both sides in a single surgery is that the raw , cut ends of the vocal cords may form an anterior glottis web , in which the two sides grow together in a continuous sheet before the hirano microflap method was developed in 1895 , vocal stripping was the most common procedure used to correct reinke 's edema recent studies have examined the role of specific cell types in reinke 's edema , including the role of vocal cord fibroblasts they lack normal expression of several cluster of differentiation and express additional proteins that are not expressed in normal vocal cord fibroblasts while smoking , gastric reflux , and vocal abuse have been more widely agreed upon in literature as risk factors for reinke 's edema , the altered bacterial cultures could be developed as a diagnostic tool in the future
