it was essentially a subset of futurebus features that could be easily implemented at high speed , along with minor additions to make it easier to connect to other systems , such as vmebus stein gjessing â€™ s group at the university of oslo used formal methods to verify the coherence protocol and dolphin server technology implemented a node controller chip including the cache coherence logic this implementation was used by sun microsystems for its high-end clusters , thales group and several others including volume applications for message passing within hpc clustering and medical imaging the standard defined two interface levels : the physical level that deals with electrical signals , connectors , mechanical and thermal conditions the logical level that describes the address space , data transfer protocols , cache coherence mechanisms , synchronization primitives , control and status registers , and initialization and error recovery facilities this structure allowed new developments in physical interface technology to be easily adapted without any redesign on the logical level sci can be used to build systems with different types of switching topologies from centralized to fully distributed switching : with a central switch , each node is connected to the switch with a ringlet ( in this case a two-node ring ) switching between the two dimensions requires a small switching capability in the node the simplest form applied in earlier systems was based on clearing the cache contents between context switches and disabling the cache for data that were shared between two or more processors modern processors with caches that are more than two orders of magnitude faster than main memory would not perform anywhere near optimal without more sophisticated methods for data consistency modern systems with point-to point links use broadcast methods with snoop filter options to improve performance instead , sci uses a distributed directory-based cache coherence protocol with a linked list of nodes containing processors that share a particular cache line sci is a standard for connecting the different resources within a multiprocessor computer system , and it is not as widely known to the public as for example the ethernet family for connecting different systems different system vendors implemented different variants of sci for their internal system infrastructure after the first 1992 edition , follow-on projects defined shared data formats in 1993 , a version using low-voltage differential signaling in 1996 , and a memory interface known as ramlink later in 1996
