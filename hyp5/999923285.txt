canibus also appeared on the music makes me high remix by the lost boyz featuring tha dogg pound making it canibus ' first official appearance on a record when the final cut of the song came out it featured ll cool j 's verse after canibus 's , mocking an unspecified person believed to be canibus because wyclef produced the majority of the tracks on can-i-bus , williams blamed him for the general dissatisfaction with can-i-bus and cut ties with him , going as far as to diss wyclef , most notably on the title track of his second album ( '' you mad at the last album ? i apologize for it / yo , i ca n't call it , motherfucking wyclef spoiled it ! '' ) though following 2000 b.c.s release it had been announced that the group would be releasing an album , these plans never materialized , with only an ep of outtakes from 2001 entitled the horsemen project released by killah priest 's management in 2003 wyclef jean would respond to canibus 's earlier remark on the track '' however you want it '' from his album , the ecleftic : 2 sides ii a book in 2001 , canibus released his third album , c true hollywood stories , the title and some of the content deriving from the television show e ! true hollywood story most explanations since the album 's release seem to lean towards the latter ; when canibus ' new official website , micclub.net , appeared online towards the end of 2002 , the summary of c true hollywood stories in the '' merchandise '' section called it '' an introspective look into the ultimate fan '' stan 's '' take on the current state of hip hop '' in an interview conducted in 2005 , williams ' former promoter , pak-man , who worked on over half of the album with the rapper , spoke on the record , with his explanation leaning toward the album being intended as satire : '' at that time canibus was in the studio recording a lot of songs and i mean a lot , but he did n't want to make the fans wait no more so he did c true hollywood stories and he wanted to have fun wit , so thats what we did we had fun wit '' in an interview on allhiphop.com posted on april 8 , 2005 , williams was asked what direction he was trying to take with that album ; in his response , he stated '' that album depicts the state of affairs in my life at the time â€“ nothing more , nothing less '' after the critical failure of c true hollywood stories , canibus was subject to criticism and ridicule from the rap industry until the release of mic club : the curriculum , his fourth full-length album , towards the end of 2002 mic club also saw canibus return to a more complex rapping style , with a number of concept tracks and few songs with a chorus before commencing his work with the military , however , he recorded a number of tracks which he intended to be released on his next album , entitled rip the jacker upon release , rip the jacker received rave reviews from the majority of critics , who noted that williams ' largely scientific lyrics and distinctive , rough delivery was finally matched by equally fine production , as canibus had a history of working with badly selected producers of note was the inclusion of '' poet laureate ii '' , a song exceeding seven minutes in length and lacking a chorus , with several changes of beat throughout ; the track was frequently singled out as one of the strongest in canibus ' career and the album as a whole convinced listeners and the industry alike that the rapper had not lost his potential canibus had never planned for it to be compiled as a separate record , but agreed to release it through the independent gladiator music label as part of a contractual agreement ; most of the vocals for mind control had been recorded prior to the release of c true hollywood stories a collection of previously recorded material ( with only three of the songs being unreleased ) produced entirely by mark sparks , the album failed to chart and is rarely considered an official canibus release by the rapper 's fans also in 2005 , a collaboration between williams and underground rapper phoenix orion , who had also been known for scientific lyrics , yielded the album def con zero , released on the independent head trauma records label , owned by k-1 kickboxer dewey cooper the following month , after numerous delays , canibus ' seventh solo album , hip-hop for sale , was released , but was panned by critics , who dismissed it as yet another failed attempt to gain mainstream recognition additionally , due to the earlier release of mind control and the leaking of most of the material in the form of a mixtape entitled the vitruvian man , the release date had been pushed back to november , the original date having been may the production on hip-hop for sale was handled in part by virginia-based producer nottz , with several relatively unknown producers handling the remaining tracks after nottz had cut ties with canibus due to the appearance of the vitruvian man.the day of hip-hop for sales release , mic club master volume one , a separate mixtape , appeared in stores , many of the songs receiving more praise than those present on the full-length album a pair of mixtapes , titled nothing to prove and nothing to lose , were slated for release in march 2007 , but were eventually scrapped ; instead , canibus decided to use the best material from each mixtape to create a new full-length album entitled for whom the beat tolls '' for whom the beat tolls '' was originally set for release in may 2007 , but was pushed back one month , and a released on june 12 , 2007 ( though it was not distributed by universal as previously reported ) the album included several guest appearances ( dzk~pr~ & warbux ) , a marked contrast to many of his previous albums in which he kept features at a minimum originally recorded in 2008 , it was sent to interdependent media for track mastery and release originally intended to be a melatonin magik remix album , as more and more guests were invited to feature , canibus decided to also record new material for the album , and it quickly evolved into an official solo album a track entitled '' spring training '' was released by joe budden two days after '' lyrical law vs joey cupcakes '' containing lines directed towards canibus an open letter , originally thought to have been written by canibus on tumblr , explaining his performance about the battle surfaced online , though it was later debunked by his manager as fake , saying that canibus will make an official statement when the time is right
