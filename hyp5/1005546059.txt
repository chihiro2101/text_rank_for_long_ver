evaluation functions in chess consist of a material balance term that dominates the evaluation , plus a set of positional terms usually totaling no more than the value of a pawn , though in some positions the positional terms can get much larger , such as when checkmate is imminent an evaluation function also implicitly encodes the value of the right to move , which can vary from a small fraction of a pawn to win or loss not just the absolute value of the material , but also the ratio between white and black material matters : sacrificing a pawn in the opening may confer a positional advantage ( the material ratio is scarcely affected ) , but the plus of a pawn in a king and pawn end game is usually sufficient to win ( ratio of material is large ) ' the mobility score is the number of legal moves available to a player , or alternately the sum of the number of spaces attacked or defended by each piece , including spaces occupied by friendly or opposing pieces effective mobility , or the number of '' safe '' spaces a piece may move to , may also be taken into account , are n't necessarily constant - they are application coefficients that can vary with stage of game ( opening , middle game , endgame ) , pieces on the board ( e.g in mating situations , the relevant factors are distance of the target king from the edge or corner of the board , and proximity of the king and mating pieces to the opposing king in a particular implementation , each composite pseudo-term may be represented by a handful to possibly hundreds of individual terms , each with its own weight or computed value the terms composing some factors , like king safety , combine non-linearly - one weakness in king safety , like an open file adjacent to the king , may be penalized for example , by 1/4 pawn , but two weaknesses may need to be penalized one or even two full pawns , and three weaknesses by a piece , a rook or even more because checkmate is becoming a likely possibility the typical pawn-multiple values assigned to the pieces are n't constant either , but depend on context : undeveloped pieces are worth far less as are pieces with reduced mobility for any reason : bishops confined by their own pawns ( '' the bad bishop '' ) ; knights lose value as the position is cleared of pieces , and bishops and rooks gain value ; queens are worth substantially more if the opposing king is n't sheltered against checks evaluation functions typically contain dozens to hundreds of individual terms , and the evaluation of a position typically ranges from plus or minus a small fraction of a pawn for example , knights are seldom found on left and right edges of the board in master games , so one may assign a penalty value to those spaces of the knight piece-square table proportionate to how seldom a knight is found there in master games
