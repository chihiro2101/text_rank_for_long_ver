scientific study of the volcano is also facilitated by its proximity to mcmurdo station ( u.s researchers spent more than three months during the 2007–08 field season installing an atypically dense array of seismometers around mount erebus to listen to waves of energy generated by small , controlled blasts from explosives they buried along its flanks and perimeter , and to record scattered seismic signals generated by lava lake eruptions and local ice quakes by studying the refracted and scattered seismic waves , the scientists produced an image of the uppermost ( top few km ) of the volcano to understand the geometry of its '' plumbing '' and how the magma rises to the lava lake these results demonstrated a complex upper-volcano conduit system with appreciable upper-volcano magma storage to the northwest of the lava lake at depths hundreds of meters below the surface erebus is notable for its numerous ice fumaroles – ice towers that form around gases that escape from vents in the surface the caves at erebus are at high altitude , yet accessible for study mount erebus is large enough to have several named features on its slopes , including a number of craters and rock formations named craters located on mount erebus include side crater , a nearly circular crater named for its location on the side of the main summit cone , and western crater , named for the slope on which it sits on the northwest upper slope of the active cone near a former exploration camp site , lava flow has formed a prominent outcropping called nausea knob , named for the nausea caused by elevation sickness two of the camp sites they used have been recognised for their historic significance : upper “ summit camp ” site ( hsm 89 ) consists of part of a circle of rocks , which were probably used to weight the tent valances lower “ camp e ” site ( hsm 90 ) consists of a slightly elevated area of gravel , as well as some aligned rocks , which may have been used to weight the tent valances dante was designed to acquire gas samples from the magma lake inside the inner crater of mount erebus to understand the chemistry better through the use of the on-board gas chromatograph , as well as measuring the temperature inside the volcano and the radioactivity of the materials present in such volcanoes dante successfully scaled a significant portion of the crater before technical difficulties emerged with the fibre-optic cable used for communications between the walker and base station since dante had not yet reached the bottom of the crater , no data of volcanic significance was recorded passenger photographs taken seconds before the collision ruled out the '' flying in a cloud '' theory , showing perfectly clear visibility well beneath the cloud base , with landmarks to the left and to the right of the aircraft visible royal commission report , para 28 the mountain directly ahead was lit by sunlight shining from directly behind the aircraft through the cloud deck above , resulting in a lack of shadows that made mount erebus effectively invisible against the overcast sky beyond in a classic whiteout ( more accurately , '' flat-light '' ) phenomenon file : mount erebus craters , ross island , antarctica ( aerial view , 18 december 2000 )
