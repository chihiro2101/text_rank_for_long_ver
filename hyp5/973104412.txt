typically , the majority of carbonate rocks are composed of reef material tsujita , earth , an introduction to physical geology , national library of canada cataloguing in publication , 2005 , chemical sedimentary rocks , including some carbonates , are deposited by precipitation of minerals from aqueous solution a large proportion of the world 's uranium energy resources are hosted within sedimentary successions the aim of sedimentology , studying sediments , is to derive information on the depositional conditions which acted to deposit the rock unit , and the relation of the individual rock units in a basin into a coherent understanding of the evolution of the sedimentary sequences and basins , and thus , the earth 's geological history as a whole the scientific basis of this is the principle of uniformitarianism , which states that the sediments within ancient sedimentary rocks were deposited in the same way as sediments which are being deposited at the earth 's surface today sedimentological conditions are recorded within the sediments as they are laid down ; the form of the sediments at present reflects the events of the past and all events which affect the sediments , from the source of the sedimentary material to the stresses enacted upon them after diagenesis are available for study thus , when the younging direction is known , the rocks can be '' unfolded '' and interpreted according to the contained sedimentary information the methods employed by sedimentologists to gather data and evidence on the nature and depositional conditions of sedimentary rocks include ; measuring and describing the outcrop and distribution of the rock unit ; describing the rock formation , a formal process of documenting thickness , lithology , outcrop , distribution , contact relationships to other formations mapping the distribution of the rock unit , or units descriptions of rock core ( drilled and extracted from wells during hydrocarbon exploration ) sequence stratigraphy describes the progression of rock units within a basin describing the lithology of the rock ; petrology and petrography ; particularly measurement of texture , grain size , grain shape ( sphericity , rounding , etc '' the research shows that some mudstones may have formed in fast-moving waters : '' mudstones can be deposited under more energetic conditions than widely assumed , requiring a reappraisal of many geologic records
