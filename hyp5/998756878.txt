these birds also initially have grey irises , which change to a pale yellow colour by the time the bird is a year old the timneh parrot also has a reputation of being less nervous around strangers and novel situations than the congo , but whether this is true or not is still debated enlp is a common illness in other animals as well the grey parrot is also one of the three parrots that scientists found to commonly suffer from dehydration another disease that the grey parrots get is cardiomyopathy which is a heart disease usually presented at a young age in the study 253 clinical samples were taken from 27 bird species belonging to seven orders also acknowledged are claims of captive grey parrots reaching the ages of 73 and 93 , whereas the world parrot trust lists a longevity of 50–60 years for a grey in captivity irene pepperberg 's research with captive greys , most notably with a bird named alex , has scientifically demonstrated that they possess the ability to associate simple human words with meanings , and to intelligently apply the abstract concepts of shape , colour , number , zero-sense , etc as well as labeling objects , alex could verbally express what his wants were , suggesting that grey parrots know the difference between features and feelings in general , it has been shown that grey parrots are able to learn relatively quickly , though they are limited to simple and non-abstract mediums of thinking for example , in one experiment involving food hidden under cups , it was shown that greys can identify where the food is , usually if shown its original location at first pet greys may learn to speak within their first year , but many do n't say their first word until 12–18 months old both subspecies seem to have the same ability and tendency to produce human speech , but vocal ability and proclivity may range widely among individual birds grey parrots tend to use more specific calls for different species coming their way which can be known as stimulus specificity , since there is a stimulus vocalization the birds have one notable grey parrot is n'kisi , which in 2004 was said to have a vocabulary of over 950 words and , like pepperberg 's alex , was noted for creative use of language nkisi audio text 1 for example , when jane goodall visited n'kisi in his new york home , he greeted her with '' got a chimp ? '' because he had seen pictures of her with chimpanzees in africa the parrots appeared to express individual preferences as to which of the other test birds they would work with in an experiment about local enhancement in grey parrots , food was visibly hidden under two separate cups instead of remembering which cup had the food , the birds would show preference to the one that was touched last in general , most animals can not associate sounds with objects , such as food , placed into a cup while originally only the great apes and young human children were known to make this association with ease , it was found that grey parrots , under most conditions , can also associate sounds with the presence of an object for the most part , grey parrots performed more successfully if the cup was shaken horizontally before it is given the choice of selecting which contained food , however , further experimentation indicated that it is not a requirement and proved that grey parrots have very high cognitive abilities grey parrots use different alarm calls for different predators coming their way throughout the day they spent time in a room with toys and came into fairly regular contact with the humans taking care of them in the next 3 years , the parrots made over 50,000 vocalisations they also made calls similar to those of other captive grey parrots in different locations and even wild grey parrots a recent analysis suggests up to 21 % of the global population may be taken from the wild annually , primarily for the pet trade , as they are good in talking they have a devoted following among parrot owners like most parrots , they are not domesticated , and even a well-socialized , hand-raised , aviary-bred bird is usually only one or two generations removed from its wild predecessor wright , maggie ( 2001 ) : african grey parrots : everything about history , care , nutrition , handling , and behavior world parrot trust parrot encyclopedia – species profile african grey news & conservation honolulu zoo african grey parrot centre information about supporting grey parrots the parrot club an excellent resource for keepers of all parrots tinkerbell & riamfada having a full flighted cag as companion at home and outside african grey parrotfarm having a full african grey parrotfarm
