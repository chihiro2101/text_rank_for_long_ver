much like the term '' byzantine '' , which was invented in the 16th century , '' latin empire '' was not a contemporary name used by or for the regime set up by the crusaders of the fourth crusade in constantinople instead , both terms were invented much later by historians seeking to differentiate between the classical period of the roman empire , the medieval period of the byzantine empire , and the late medieval latin empire , all of which called themselves '' roman '' although this is a marked departure from the standard byzantine nomenclature and ideology ( designating the empire as the basileía rhōmaíōn , '' empire of the romans '' ) , imperium constantinopolitanum was the standard name used for the eastern empire in western sources , such as in papal correspondence , and suggests that the latin leaders viewed themselves as “ taking over ” the empire rather than “ replacing ” it it would have been difficult for the crusaders to justify referring to the empire as '' roman '' considering that western europe generally held the germanic holy roman empire to represent the legitimate roman empire nevertheless , the crusaders were well aware of the fact that constantinople was the capital of the roman empire and that the greek-speaking inhabitants of the empire saw themselves as romaioi ( romans ) the term '' romania '' had been used unofficially by the population of the byzantine empire for their country for centuries on the long history of '' romania '' as a territorial name for the roman and ( later ) byzantine empires , see r.l usage of the title emperor of constantinople may not just have been to appease the pope and western europe , but might also have been used to legitimize the rule of the latin emperors in regards to the byzantines that they ruled philadelphia never came under actual latin control , although the latin emperor henry of flanders laid claim to the region after defeating the local strongman , theodore mangaphas , in 1205 the doge of venice did not rank as a vassal to the latin empire , but his position in control of three-eighths of its territory and of parts of constantinople itself ensured venice 's influence in the empire 's affairs however , much of the former byzantine territory remained in the hands of rival successor states led by byzantine greek aristocrats , such as the despotate of epirus , the empire of nicaea , and the empire of trebizond , each bent on reconquest from the latins the crowning of baldwin i ( 16 may 1204 ) and the establishment of the latin empire had the curious effect of creating five simultaneously existing entities claiming to be successors of the roman empire : the latin empire , the holy roman empire , and the three remnants of the byzantine empire , the despotate of epirus , the empire of nicaea , and the empire of trebizond none of these polities actually controlled rome , which remained under the papal states at the battle of poimanenon in 1224 , the latin army was defeated , and by the next year emperor robert of courtenay was forced to cede all his asian possessions to nicaea , except for nicomedia and the territories directly across from constantinople unlike in asia , where the latin empire faced only an initially weak nicaea , in europe it was immediately confronted with a powerful enemy : the bulgarian tsar kaloyan distracted by the renewed war with nicaea , and waiting in vain for assistance from pope honorius iii and the king of france philip ii , the latin empire was unable to prevent the final fall of thessalonica to epirus in 1224 thus , on 25 july 1261 , with most of the latin troops away on campaign , the nicaean general alexios strategopoulos found an unguarded entrance to the city , and entered it with 800 troops only , restoring the byzantine empire for his master , michael viii palaiologos the remaining latin states ruled territories of present-day greece , some of them until the 18th century , and are known as latinokratia states for about a century thereafter , the heirs of baldwin ii continued to use the title of emperor of constantinople , and were seen as the overlords of the various remaining latin states in the aegean
