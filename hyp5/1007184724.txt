president bill clinton announced his invitation to israeli prime minister ehud barak and yasser arafat on 5 july 2000 , to come to camp david , maryland , in order to continue their negotiations on the middle east peace process the oslo accords of 1993 between the later assassinated israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin and palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat had provided that agreement should be reached on all outstanding issues between the palestinians and israeli sides – the so-called final status settlement – within five years of the implementation of state of palestine however , the interim process put in place under oslo had fulfilled neither israeli nor palestinian expectations 7 , 15-19 the talks ultimately failed to reach agreement on the final status issues : territory jerusalem and the temple mount refugees and palestinian right of return security arrangements settlements the palestinian negotiators indicated they wanted full palestinian sovereignty over the entire west bank and the gaza strip , although they would consider a one-to-one land swap with israel their historic position was that palestinians had already made a territorial compromise with israel by accepting israel 's right to 78 % of '' historic palestine '' , and accepting their state on the remaining 22 % of such land they maintained that resolution 242 calls for full israeli withdrawal from these territories , which were captured in the six-day war , as part of a final peace settlement israel wanted to annex the numerous settlement blocks on the palestinian side of the green line , and were concerned that a complete return to the 1967 borders was dangerous to israel 's security based on the israeli definition of the west bank , barak offered to form a palestinian state initially on 73 % of the west bank ( that is , 27 % less than the green line borders ) and 100 % of the gaza strip from the palestinian perspective this equated to an offer of a palestinian state on a maximum of 86 % of the west bank the west bank would be split in the middle by an israeli-controlled road from jerusalem to the dead sea , with free passage for palestinians , although israel reserved the right to close the road to passage in case of emergency these would be under the sovereignty of israel , and israel reserved the right to close them to passage in case of emergency additional grounds of rejection was that the israeli proposal planned to annex areas which would lead to a cantonization of the west bank into three blocs , which the palestinian delegation likened to south african bantustans , a loaded word that was disputed by the israeli and american negotiators further , the border between west bank and jordan would additionally be under israeli control leaders were ill-prepared for the central role the jerusalem issue in general and the temple mount dispute in particular would play in the negotiations p.80 www.waronsacredgrounds.org at the opening of camp david , barak warned the americans he could not accept giving the palestinians more than a purely symbolic sovereignty over any part of east jerusalem israeli negotiators also proposed that the palestinians be granted administration of , but not sovereignty over , the muslim and christian quarters of the old city , with the jewish and armenian quarters remaining in israeli hands israelis asserted that allowing a right of return to israel proper , rather than to the newly created palestinian state , would mean an influx of palestinians that would fundamentally alter the demographics of israel , jeopardizing israel 's jewish character and its existence as a whole at camp david , the palestinians maintained their traditional demand that the right of return be implemented they demanded that israel recognize the right of all refugees who so wished to settle in israel , but to address israel 's demographic concerns , they promised that the right of return would be implemented via a mechanism agreed upon by both sides , which would try to channel a majority of refugees away from the option of returning to israel secretary of state madeleine albright , some of the palestinian negotiators were willing to privately discuss a limit on the number of refugees who would be allowed to return to israel the israeli negotiators denied that israel was responsible for the refugee problem , and were concerned that any right of return would pose a threat to israel 's jewish character in the israeli proposal , a maximum of 100,000 refugees would be allowed to return to israel on the basis of humanitarian considerations or family reunification israel also demanded that the palestinian state be demilitarized with the exception of its paramilitary security forces , that it would not make alliances without israeli approval or allow the introduction of foreign forces west of the jordan river , and that it dismantle terrorist groups 110–111 one of israel 's strongest demands was that arafat declare the conflict over , and make no further demands israel also wanted water resources in the west bank to be shared by both sides and remain under israeli management procon , 30 april 2008 , what were the 2000 clinton parameters , and were they an acceptable solution ? although the official statements stated that both parties had accepted the clinton parameters with reservations , embassy of the united states , israel , 3 january 2001 , excerpts : state dept clinton 's initiative led to the taba summit in january 2001 , where the two sides published a statement saying they had never been closer to agreement ( though such issues as jerusalem , the status of gaza , and the palestinian demand for compensation for refugees and their descendants remained unresolved ) , but barak , facing elections , re-suspended the talks ehud barak portrays arafat 's behavior at camp david as a '' performance geared to exact as many israeli concessions as possible without ever seriously intending to reach a peace settlement or sign an '' end to the conflict during a lecture in australia , ross suggested that the reason for the failure was arafat 's unwillingness to sign a final deal with israel that would close the door on any of the palestinians ' maximum demands , particularly the right of return kenneth levin summarized the failure of the 2000 camp david summit in this manner : '' despite the dimensions of the israeli offer and intense pressure from president clinton , arafat demurred alan dershowitz , an israel advocate and a law professor at harvard university , said that the failure of the negotiations was due to '' the refusal of the palestinians and arafat to give up the right of return swisher , the director of programs at the middle east institute , concluded that the israelis and the americans were at least as guilty as the palestinians for the collapse '' shlomo ben-ami , then israel 's minister of foreign relations who participated in the talks , stated that the palestinians wanted the immediate withdrawal of the israelis from the west bank , gaza strip and east jerusalem , and only subsequently the palestinian authority would dismantle the palestinian organizations in 2006 , shlomo ben-ami stated on democracy now ! that '' camp david was not the missed opportunity for the palestinians , and if i were a palestinian i would have rejected camp david , as well judged from the perspective of palestinians ' and israelis ' respective rights under international law , all the concessions at camp david came from the palestinian side , none from the israeli side article is excerpted from his longer essay called subordinating palestinian rights to israeli '' needs '' berkeley political science professor ron hassner has argued that it was the failure of participants at the negotiations to include religious leaders in the process or even consult with religious experts prior to the negotiations , that led to the collapse of the negotiations over the subject of jerusalem as a result , neither party had prepared seriously for the possibility that the temple mount issue would come to stand at the heart of the negotiations '' political scientist menahem klein , who advised the israeli government during the negotiations , confirmed that '' the professional back channels did not sufficiently treat jerusalem as a religious city overall , 68 % of the palestinian public thought arafat 's positions on a final agreement at camp david were just right and 14 % thought arafat compromised too much while only 6 % thought arafat had not compromised enough only 25 % of the israeli public thought his positions on camp david were just right as opposed to 58 % of the public that thought barak compromised too much a majority of israelis were opposed to barak 's position on every issue discussed at camp david except for security a first hand account from the
