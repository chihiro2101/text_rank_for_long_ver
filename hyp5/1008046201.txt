500 years of new words , bill sherk the first use of the word semaphore in reference to english use was in 1816 : '' the improved semaphore has been erected on the top of the admiralty '' , referring to the installation of a simpler telegraph invented by sir home popham using a network of signalling sections erected on high ground , the signal would be observed from one station to the next by means of a telescope a series of two such signals gave a total 64 code elements and a third signal took it up to 512 credit for the first successful optical telegraph goes to the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers in 1792 , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of in mid-1790 , the chappe brothers set about devising a system of communication that would allow the central government to receive intelligence and to transmit orders in the shortest possible time 53 chappe settled on an optical system and the first public demonstration occurred on 2 march 1791 between brûlon and parcé , a distance of how napoleon 's semaphore telegraph changed the world , bbc news , hugh schofield , 16 june 2013 the first symbol of a message to lille would pass through 15 stations in only nine minutes the speed of the line varied with the weather , but the line to lille typically transferred 36 symbols , a complete message , in about 32 minutes step 2 , movement 3 ( completion ) : the operator turned the cross bar to a vertical or horizontal position , indicating the end of a cycle in this manner , each symbol could propagate down the line as quickly as operators could successfully copy it , with acknowledgement and flow control built into the protocol in 1801 he had abraham chappe build an extra-large station to transmit across the english channel in preparation for an invasion of britain a pair of such stations were built on a test line over a comparable distance in 1812 , napoleon took up another design of abraham chappe for a mobile telegraph that could be taken with him on campaign mr gamble also proposed two distinct five-element systems in 1795 : one using five shutters , and one using five ten-foot poles the british admiralty accepted murray 's system in september 1795 , and the first system was the 15 site chain from london to deal a replacement semaphore system was sought , and of the many ideas and devices put forward the admiralty chose the simpler semaphore system invented by sir home popham an experimental semaphore line between the admiralty and chatham was installed in july 1816 , and its success helped to confirm the choice the line was operational from 1822 until 1847 , when the railway and electric telegraph provided a better means of communication the line is possibly the only example of an optical telegraph built entirely for commercial purposes the line was kept in operation until 1860 when a railway line and associated electrical telegraph made it redundant 197 seija-riitta laakso , across the oceans : development of overseas business information transmission 1815-1875 , bod -
