the ctinidia lie mainly within the branchial siphon , through which the animal pumps the water that passes over the gill where they leave the end of the main part of the body , the siphons pass between a pair of calcareous plates called pallets the pallets are not to be confused with the two valves of the main shell , which are at the anterior end of the animal because they are the organs that the animal applies to boring its tunnel , they generally are located at the tunnel 's end the outer surfaces are convex and in most species are deeply sculpted into sharp grinding surfaces with which the animals bore their way through the wood or similar medium in which they live and feed accordingly , it is rare in the brackish baltic sea , where wooden shipwrecks are preserved for much longer than in the oceans the range of various species has changed over time based on human activity the existence of huge mollusks was established for centuries and studied by the scientists , based on the shells they 've left behind that were the size of baseball bats the bivalve animal is a rare creature that spends its life inside an elephant tusk-like hard shell made of calcium carbonate the valves of the shell of shipworms are small separate parts located at the anterior end of the worm , used for excavating the burrow historically , teredo concentrations in the caribbean sea have been substantially higher than in most other salt water bodies shipworms greatly damage wooden hulls and marine piling , and have been the subject of much study to find methods to avoid their attacks copper sheathing was used on wooden ships in the latter 18th century and afterwards , as a method of preventing damage by '' teredo worms '' based on his observations of how the shipworm 's valves simultaneously enable it to tunnel through wood and protect it from being crushed by the swelling timber , brunel designed an ingenious modular iron tunnelling framework—the very first tunnelling shield—which enabled workers to tunnel successfully through the highly unstable river bed beneath the thames
