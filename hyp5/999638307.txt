at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets ed reitan , '' cbs field sequential color system '' , 24 august 1997 rca worked along different lines entirely , using the luminance-chrominance system color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a composite video signal & ndash ; on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity , but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice although rca 's system had enormous benefits , it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era , and rca 's early experiments used three-tube projectors , or mirror-based systems known as '' triniscope '' after several thousand sets had shipped , the situation was no better , while panasonic and toshiba were in the process of introducing sets based on rca licenses to look for potential licenses , and was impressed with the improvements that rca had made in overall brightness by introducing new rare earth phosphors on the screen he also saw general electric 's '' porta-color '' design , using three guns in a row instead of a triangle , which allowed a greater portion of the screen to be lit although this would require the guns to be very carefully aligned with the phosphors on the tube in order to ensure they hit the right colors , with miyaoka 's new tube , this appeared possible in spite of trinitron and chromatron having no technology in common , the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar , or the same officially introduced by ibuka in april 1968 , the original 12 & nbsp ; inch trinitron had a display quality that easily surpassed any commercial set in terms of brightness , color fidelity , and simplicity of operation it was also all solid state , with the exception of the picture tube itself , which allowed it to be much more compact and cool running than designs like ge 's porta-color some larger models such as the kv-1320ub for the united kingdom market were initially fitted with 3at2 valves for the extra high tension ( high voltage ) circuitry , before being redesigned as solid state in the early 70s early color sets intended for the uk market had a pal decoder that was different from those invented and licensed by telefunken of germany , who invented the pal color system new models quickly followed early models were generally packaged in silver cases , but with the introduction of the darker screens , sony also introduced new cases with a dark charcoal color , following a similar change in color taking place in the hi-fi world '' kx-20ps1 '' the concept was to build a market similar to contemporary stereo equipment , where components from different vendors could be mixed to produce a complete system however , a lack of any major third party components , along with custom connectors between the tuner and monitors , meant that systems mixing fully compatible elements were never effectively realized they were popular high-end units , however , and found a strong following in production companies where the excellent quality picture made them effective low-cost monitors they originally used tubes similar to the profeel line , but over time , they gradually increased in resolution until the late 1990s when they offered over 900 lines when these were cancelled as part of the wider trinitron shutdown in 2007 , professionals forced sony to re-open two of the lines to produce the 20 and 14 & nbsp ; inch models demand was high , so high that there were examples of third party companies removing trinitron tubes from televisions to use as monitors new uses in the computer field and the demand for higher resolution televisions to match the quality of dvd when it was introduced in 1996 led to increased sales , with another 180 million units delivered in the next decade after the expiration of sony 's trinitron patent , manufacturers like mitsubishi ( whose monitor production is now part of nec display solutions ) were free to use the trinitron design for their own product line without license from sony although they could not use the trinitron name sony responded with the fd trinitron , which used computer-controlled feedback systems to ensure sharp focus across a flat screen initially introduced on their 27 , 32 and 36 & nbsp ; inch models in 1998 , the new tubes were offered in a variety of resolutions for different uses many other companies entered the market quickly , widely copying the new silver styling as well at the same time , the introduction of plasma televisions , and then lcd-based ones , led to the high-end market being increasingly focused on the '' thin '' sets both of these technologies have well known problems , and for some time sony explored a wide array of technologies that would improve upon them in the same way the trinitron did on the shadow mask sony also introduced their plasmatron displays , and later lcd as well , but these had no inherent technical advantages over similar sets from other companies in comparison to early shadow mask designs , the trinitron grille cuts off much less of the signal coming from the electron guns improvements to the shadow mask designs continually narrowed this difference between the two designs , and by the late 1980s the difference in performance , at least theoretically , was eliminated to ensure that the guns were focused on the holes , a system known as dynamic convergence had to constantly adjust the focus point as the beam moved across the screen this was a major selling point of the trinitron design for much of its history in the 1990s , new computer-controlled real-time feedback focusing systems eliminated this advantage , as well as leading to the introduction of '' true flat '' designs these wires are less apparent or completely obscured on standard definition sets due to wider scan lines to match the lower resolution of the video being displayed on computer monitors , where the scan lines are much closer together , the wires are often visible
