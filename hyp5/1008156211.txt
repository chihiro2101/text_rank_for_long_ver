morton ( 1962 ) reviews the pressures at work on that part of rupert 's land where winnipeg now stands , a decade before its incorporation into canada there was strong business and political agitation in upper canada for annexing the territory ; in london the company 's trading license was due for review ; in st the hudson 's bay company 's '' laws '' in the 17th century and 18th centuries had been the regulations settling out the rules governing the relationships between various employees in the company 's posts in rupert 's land and to interact with indigenous peoples in the early 19th century , the hbc had waged a violent struggle with the rival north west company based in montreal for the control of the fur trade culminating in the seven oaks massacre of 1816 , which led to an investigation by the house of commons of the united kingdom , and which in turn led to the second canada jurisdiction act of 1821 , ordering the hudson 's bay company to establish justice of the peace courts in rupert 's land baker ( 1999 ) uses the red river colony , the only non-native settlement on the northwest prairies for most of the 19th century , as a site for critical exploration of the meaning of '' law and order '' on the canadian frontier and for an investigation of the sources from which legal history might be rewritten as the history of legal culture previous historians have assumed that the hudson 's bay company 's representatives designed and implemented a local legal system dedicated instrumentally to the protection of the company 's fur trade monopoly and , more generally , to strict control of settlement life in the company 's interests baker shows that the legal history of the red river colony – and , by extension , of the canadian west in general – is based on english common law following the forced merger of the north west company with the hbc in 1821 , british parliament applied the laws of upper canada to rupert 's land and the columbia district and gave enforcement power to the hbc the hudson 's bay company maintained peace in rupert 's land for the benefit of the fur trade ; the plains indians had achieved a rough balance of power among themselves ; the organization of the métis provided internal security and a degree of external protection while it is often said that hudson 's bay '' sold '' rupert 's land as well as the north-western territory , the company had no land to sell : its charter was essentially for a trading monopoly enforceable on british subjects control was originally planned to be transferred on 1 december 1869 , but due to the premature action of the new lieutenant governor , william mcdougall , the people of red river formed a provisional government that took control until arrangements could be negotiated by leaders of what is known as the red river resistance and the newly formed government of canada
