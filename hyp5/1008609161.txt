owing to friction and the rigidity of the constituent rocks , the two sides of a fault can not always glide or flow past each other easily , and so occasionally all movement stops the regions of higher friction along a fault plane , where it becomes locked , are called asperities stress builds up when a fault is locked , and when it reaches a level that exceeds the strength threshold , the fault ruptures and the accumulated strain energy is released in part as seismic waves , forming an earthquake a fault in ductile rocks can also release instantaneously when the strain rate is too great slip is defined as the relative movement of geological features present on either side of a fault plane a fault 's sense of slip is defined as the relative motion of the rock on each side of the fault concerning the other side the vector of slip can be qualitatively assessed by studying any drag folding of strata , which may be visible on either side of the fault ; the direction and magnitude of heave and throw can be measured only by finding common intersection points on either side of the fault ( called a piercing point ) these terms are important for distinguishing different dip-slip fault types : reverse faults and normal faults distinguishing between these two fault types is important for determining the stress regime of the fault movement based on the direction of slip , faults can be categorized as : strike-slip , where the offset is predominantly horizontal , parallel to the fault trace ; dip-slip , offset is predominantly vertical and/or perpendicular to the fault trace ; or oblique-slip , combining strike and dip slip in a strike-slip fault ( also known as a wrench fault , tear fault or transcurrent fault ) , the fault surface ( plane ) is usually near vertical , and the footwall moves laterally either left or right with very little vertical motion fault-bend folds are formed by the movement of the hanging wall over a non-planar fault surface and are found associated with both extensional and thrust faults nearly all faults have some component of both dip-slip and strike-slip ; hence , defining a fault as oblique requires both dip and strike components to be measurable and significant some oblique faults occur within transtensional and transpressional regimes , and others occur where the direction of extension or shortening changes during the deformation but the earlier formed faults remain active synthetic faults dip in the same direction as the major fault while the antithetic faults dip in the opposite direction all faults have a measurable thickness , made up of deformed rock characteristic of the level in the crust where the faulting happened , of the rock types affected by the fault and of the presence and nature of any mineralising fluids a fault that passes through different levels of the lithosphere will have many different types of fault rock developed along its surface
