heat is defined in physics as the transfer of thermal energy across a well-defined boundary around a thermodynamic system in engineering contexts , the term heat is taken as synonymous to thermal energy heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms , such as thermal conduction , thermal convection , thermal radiation , and transfer of energy by phase changes thermal conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat and evaluated primarily in terms of fourier 's law for heat conduction ; convection : the transfer of energy between an object and its environment , due to fluid motion conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact steady state conduction is an idealized model of conduction that happens when the temperature difference driving the conduction is constant , so that after a time , the spatial distribution of temperatures in the conducting object does not change any further ( see fourier 's law ) in steady state conduction , the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out , since the change in temperature ( a measure of heat energy ) is zero an example of steady state conduction is the heat flow through walls of a warm house on a cold day—inside the house is maintained at a high temperature and , outside , the temperature stays low , so the transfer of heat per unit time stays near a constant rate determined by the insulation in the wall and the spatial distribution of temperature in the walls will be approximately constant over time transient conduction ( see heat equation ) occurs when the temperature within an object changes as a function of time the flow of fluid may be forced by external processes , or sometimes ( in gravitational fields ) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid ( for example in a fire plume ) , thus influencing its own transfer all convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion , as well bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations , such as ( for example ) between a solid surface and the fluid although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer , convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid ( diffusion ) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming in the case of heat transfer in fluids , where transport by advection in a fluid is always also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion ( also known as heat conduction ) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction free , or natural , convection occurs when bulk fluid motions ( streams and currents ) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due to variations of temperature in the fluid convective cooling is sometimes described as newton 's law of cooling : however , by definition , the validity of newton 's law of cooling requires that the rate of heat loss from convection be a linear function of ( '' proportional to '' ) the temperature difference that drives heat transfer , and in convective cooling this is sometimes not the case on the other hand , if heat conduction is very low , a large temperature gradient may be formed and convection might be very strong thermal radiation is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves , due to the pool of thermal energy in all matter with a temperature above absolute zero unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer , thermal radiation – arriving within a narrow angle i.e image : lightning in arlington.jpg thumb right 300px lightning is a highly visible form of energy transfer and is an example of plasma present at earth 's surface at standard atmospheric pressure and low temperatures , no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms condensation on direct contact with a cooling wall of a heat exchanger : this is the most common mode used in industry : filmwise condensation is when a liquid film is formed on the subcooled surface , and usually occurs when the liquid wets the surface the internal energy of a substance is increased , typically with heat or pressure , resulting in a rise of its temperature to the melting point , at which the ordering of ionic or molecular entities in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid liquefies system analysis by the lumped capacitance model is a common approximation in transient conduction that may be used whenever heat conduction within an object is much faster than heat conduction across the boundary of the object in this method , the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object 's boundary , known as the biot number , is calculated thermal resistance is a heat property and the measurement by which an object or material resists to heat flow ( heat per time unit or thermal resistance ) to temperature difference radiant barriers are materials that reflect radiation , and therefore reduce the flow of heat from radiation sources 300px a heat engine is a system that performs the conversion of a flow of thermal energy ( heat ) to mechanical energy to perform mechanical work sonntag : '' a heat engine may be defined as a device that operates in a thermodynamic cycle and does a certain amount of net positive work as a result of heat transfer from a high-temperature body and to a low-temperature body often the term heat engine is used in a broader sense to include all devices that produce work , either through heat transfer or combustion , even though the device does not operate in a thermodynamic cycle '' a thermocouple is a temperature-measuring device and widely used type of temperature sensor for measurement and control , and can also be used to convert heat into electric power a heat sink is a component that transfers heat generated within a solid material to a fluid medium , such as air or a liquid a heat pipe is another heat-transfer device that combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently transfer heat between two solid interfaces thermal transmittance is the rate of transfer of heat through a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure heat is produced in the body by the continuous metabolism of nutrients which provides energy for the systems of the body the body must then use additional methods to remove the additional heat produced in order to keep the internal temperature at a healthy level heat transfer occurs more readily when the temperature of the surroundings is significantly less than the normal body temperature clothing can be considered an insulator which provides thermal resistance to heat flow over the covered portion of the body the body continuously loses water by evaporation but the most significant amount of heat loss occurs during periods of increased physical activity the energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat and converted into latent heat , while the air remains at a constant enthalpy in quantum physics , laser cooling is used to achieve temperatures of near absolute zero ( −273.15 & nbsp ; °c , −459.67 & nbsp ; °f ) of atomic and molecular samples to observe unique quantum effects that can only occur at this heat level sympathetic cooling is a process in which particles of one type cool particles of another type magnetic refrigeration cools below 0.3k ,
