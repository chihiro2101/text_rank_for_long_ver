first , euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass is irrelevant this allowed him to reformulate the problem in abstract terms ( laying the foundations of graph theory ) , eliminating all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them in modern terms , one replaces each land mass with an abstract '' vertex '' or node , and each bridge with an abstract connection , an '' edge '' , which only serves to record which pair of vertices ( land masses ) is connected by that bridge in modern language , euler shows that the possibility of a walk through a graph , traversing each edge exactly once , depends on the degrees of the nodes euler 's argument shows that a necessary condition for the walk of the desired form is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree further , if there are nodes of odd degree , then any eulerian path will start at one of them and end at the other an alternative form of the problem asks for a path that traverses all bridges and also has the same starting and ending point in the history of mathematics , euler 's solution of the k√∂nigsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory and the first true proof in the theory of networks , a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics in addition , euler 's recognition that the key information was the number of bridges and the list of their endpoints ( rather than their exact positions ) presaged the development of topology thus , , five bridges exist at the same sites that were involved in euler 's problem in terms of graph theory , two of the nodes now have degree 2 , and the other two have degree 3
