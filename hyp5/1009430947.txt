early life and education he was upset by his wartime experience and disagreed with his wife over whether science should be applied to social planning or used only to foster understanding rather than action bateson was one of the original members of the core group of the macy conferences in cybernetics ( 1941–1960 ) , and the later set on group processes ( 1954–1960 ) , where he represented the social and behavioral sciences bateson spent the last decade of his life developing a '' meta-science '' of epistemology to bring together the various early forms of systems theory developing in different fields of science where others might see a set of inexplicable details , bateson perceived simple relationships bateson 's beginning years as an anthropologist were spent floundering , lost without a specific objective in mind the observations he made among the iatmul people allowed him to develop his concept of schismogenesis university of michigan press bateson suggested the influence of a circular system of causation , and proposed that : women watched for the spectacular performances of the men , and there can be no reasonable doubt that the presence of an audience is a very important factor in shaping the men 's behavior bateson 's experiences with the iatmul led him to publish a book in 1936 titled naven : a survey of the problems suggested by a composite picture of the culture of a new guinea tribe drawn from three points of view ( cambridge university press ) until bateson published naven , most anthropologists assumed a realist approach to studying culture , in which one simply described social reality bateson 's book argued that this approach was naive , since an anthropologist 's account of a culture was always and fundamentally shaped by whatever theory the anthropologist employed to define and analyse the data the sociological point of view sought to identify how the ritual helped bring about social integration much later , bateson would harness the very same idea to the development of the double-bind theory of schizophrenia '' that is to say , his overall point was not to describe iatmul culture of the naven ceremony but to explore how different modes of analysis , using different premises and analytic frameworks , could lead to different explanations of the same sociocultural phenomenon see , most recently , michael houseman and carlo seviri , 1998 , naven or the other self : a relational approach to ritual action ( leiden : brill ) ; eric kline silverman , 2001 , masculinity , motherhood and mockery : psychoanalyzing culture and the iatmul naven rite in new guinea ( ann arbor : university of michigan press ) ; andrew moutu , 2013 , names are thicker than blood : kinship and ownership amongst the iatmul ( oxford university press ) this model of stimulation and refusal was also seen in other areas of the culture the double bind refers to a communication paradox described first in families with a schizophrenic member the first place where double binds were described ( though not named as such ) was according to bateson , in samuel butler 's the way of all flesh ( a semi-autobiographical novel about victorian hypocrisy and cover-up ) bateson , steps to an ecology of mind full double bind requires several conditions to be met : the victim of double bind receives contradictory injunctions or emotional messages on different levels of communication ( for example , love is expressed by words , and hate or detachment by nonverbal behaviour ; or a child is encouraged to speak freely , but criticised or silenced whenever he or she actually does so ) no metacommunication is possible – for example , asking which of the two messages is valid or describing the communication as making no sense the double bind was originally presented ( probably mainly under the influence of bateson 's psychiatric co-workers ) as an explanation of part of the etiology of schizophrenia currently , it is considered to be more important as an example of bateson 's approach to the complexities of communication which is what he understood it to be in his conclusion he makes seven statements or theoretical positions which may be supported by his ideology the first is the idea that although environmental stresses have theoretically been believed to guide or dictate the changes in the soma ( physical body ) , the introduction of new stresses do not automatically result in the physical changes necessary for survival as suggested by original evolutionary theory an example that he gives is the sheltering of a sick person from the weather or the fact that someone who works in an office would have a hard time working as a rock climber and vice versa bateson 's third conclusion is '' that the genotypic change commonly makes demand upon the adjustive ability of the soma '' this , he states , is the commonly held belief among biologists although there is no evidence to support the claim the seventh and final theory he believes to be supported is the idea that in rare occasions there will be populations whose changes will not be in accordance with the thesis presented within this paper according to bateson , none of these positions ( at the time ) could be tested but he called for the creation of a test which could possibly prove or disprove the theoretical positions suggested within bateson also viewed that all three systems of the individual , society and ecosystem were all together a part of one supreme cybernetic system that controls everything instead of just interacting systems this supreme cybernetic system is beyond the self of the individual and could be equated to what many people refer to as god , though bateson referred to it as mind according to bateson , consciousness is the bridge between the cybernetic networks of individual , society and ecology and the mismatch between the systems due to improper understanding will result in the degradation of the entire supreme cybernetic system or mind additionally occidental epistemology propagates the false notion that man exists outside mind and this leads man to believe in what bateson calls the philosophy of control based upon false knowledge bateson claims that man will never be able to control the whole system because it does not operate in a linear fashion and if man creates his own rules for the system , he opens himself up to becoming a slave to the self-made system due to the non-linear nature of cybernetics consciousness is only one way in which to obtain knowledge and without complete knowledge of the entire cybernetic system disaster is inevitable only when thought and emotion are combined in whole is man able to obtain complete knowledge he believed that religion and art are some of the few areas in which a man is acting as a whole individual in complete consciousness by acting with this greater wisdom of the supreme cybernetic system as a whole man can change his relationship to mind from one of schism , in which he is endlessly tied up in constant competition , to one of complementarity bateson argues for a culture that promotes the most general wisdom and is able to flexibly change within the supreme cybernetic system the term was originally coined by american philosopher/logician charles sanders peirce , who used it to refer to the process by which scientific hypotheses are generated 378 like the hindu term maya , the basic idea captured in this distinction is that meaning and organisation are projected onto the world a term he coined in the 1940s referring to the organisation of learning , or learning to learn : schismogenesis – the emergence of divisions within social groups information – bateson defined information as '' a difference which makes a difference the bateson idea group ( big ) initiated a web presence in october 2010
