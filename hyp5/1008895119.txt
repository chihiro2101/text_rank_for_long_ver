the american fancy rat and mouse association ( afrma ) lists black , pink , ruby , and odd-eyed ( two differently-colored eyes ) as possible eye colors , depending on the variety of rat shown however , many domestic rats are not closely bred to any color standard ; many of those found in pet shops will have mismarkings from a formal breeding perspective , which are defined as variations in markings that are not recognized as conforming to a breed standard published by a rat fancier organisation in the united states and elsewhere , clubs like the afrma distinguish this marking as the english irish and allow for another standardized irish in which the rat may have white of an even or symmetrical nature anywhere along its underside the dumbo rat , whose origins are in the united states , is characterized by having large , low , round ears on the sides of its head caused by a recessive mutation , and was named for its resemblance to the fictional character dumbo the flying elephant remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself , but rather by the lack of it , such as hairless rats hairless rats are a coat variety characterized by varying levels of hair loss unlike a double rex , this type of hairless rat is incapable of growing hairs on any part of the body one additional subset of semi-hairless rats , patchwork rex , constantly lose their hair and regrow it in different '' patches '' several times throughout their life hairless rats may be prone to more health problems than their standard- or rex-coated counterparts , including a reduced tolerance for cold , kidney and liver failure , skin conditions , and shortened life span on one hand , breeding rats to '' conform '' to a specific standard or to develop a new one is a large part of history on the other hand , the process results in many rats who do not '' conform '' , and are then either given away , sold as food , or killedâ€”the latter referred to as culling similarly , hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat for example , the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in australia , and so various coat types , colors , and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines , or are just not obtainable within that country ( for example , hairless and dumbo rats do not exist in australia ) norvegicus are more prone to specific health risks and diseases than their wild counterparts , but they are also far less likely to succumb to certain illnesses that are prevalent in the wild it may appear like dried blood , but is a mucus-like substance which is released at times of stress or if the rat has a respiratory infection mrm is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets one fear is that all rats carry plague , when in fact r however , it has been determined that a pet rat 's initial exposure to salmonella , along with many other zoonotic rat diseases , typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations , either from an infestation in the owner 's home , or from the pet 's contaminated food , water , or bedding this is a rare disease among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses ( usually with the intention of being snake food rather than pets ) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats
