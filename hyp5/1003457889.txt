the possibility of such an international gathering of bishops had first emerged during the jubilee of the church missionary society in 1851 when a number of us bishops were present in london however , the initial impetus came from episcopal churches in canada in 1865 the synod of that province , in an urgent letter to the archbishop of canterbury , ( charles thomas longley ) , represented the unsettlement of members of the canadian church caused by recent legal decisions of the privy council and their alarm lest the revived action of convocation '' should leave us governed by canons different from those in force in england and ireland , and thus cause us to drift into the status of an independent branch of the catholic church '' they therefore requested him to call a '' national synod of the bishops of the anglican church at home and abroad '' , to meet under his leadership many anglican bishops ( amongst them the archbishop of york and most of his suffragans ) felt so doubtful as to the wisdom of such an assembly that they refused to attend it , and dean stanley declined to allow westminster abbey to be used for the closing service , giving as his reasons the partial character of the assembly , uncertainty as to the effect of its measures and '' the presence of prelates not belonging to our church '' '' seventy-six bishops accepted the primate 's invitation to the first conference , which met at lambeth on 24 september 1867 and sat for four days , the sessions being in private from 1978 onwards the conference has been held on the canterbury campus of the university of kent allowing the bishops to live and worship together on the same site for the first time the archbishop of york and several other english bishops refused to attend because they thought such a conference would cause '' increased confusion '' about controversial issues day two was spent on a discussion of synodical authority concluding that the faith and unity of the anglican communion would be best maintained by there being a synod above those of the '' several branches '' it was agreed that the reports of the committees would be received at a final meeting on 10 december by those bishops still in england no one session of the conference had all the bishops attending although all signed the address and longley was authorised to add the names of absent bishops who later subscribed to it one bishop suffragan and a number of former colonial bishops with commissions in england also attended as full members presided over by : edward white benson 145 bishops present the agenda of this conference was noticeable for its attention to matters beyond the internal organisation of the anglican communion and its attempts to engage with some of the major social issues that the member churches were encountering in addition to the encyclical letter , nineteen resolutions were put forth , and the reports of twelve special committees are appended upon which they are based , the subjects being intemperance , virtue , divorce , polygamy , observance of sunday , socialism , care of emigrants , mutual relations of dioceses of the anglican communion , home reunion , scandinavian churches , old catholics , etc one of the chief subjects for consideration was the creation of a tribunal of reference , but the resolutions on this subject were withdrawn due to opposition of the bishops of the episcopal church in the usa , and a more general resolution in favour of a '' consultative body '' was substituted the encyclical letter is accompanied by sixty-three resolutions ( which include careful provision for provincial organisation and the extension of the title archbishop '' to all metropolitans , a thankful recognition of the revival of brotherhoods and sisterhoods , and of the office of deaconess , '' and a desire to promote friendly relations with the eastern churches and the various old catholic bodies ) , and the reports of the eleven committees are subjoined the single most important action of this conference was to issue the '' appeal to all christian people '' , which set out the basis on which anglican churches would move towards visible union with churches of other traditions
