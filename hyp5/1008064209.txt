oedipus recognizes this as a sign , for when he received the prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother , apollo also revealed to him that at the end of his life he would die at a place sacred to the furies and be a blessing for the land in which he is buried the chorus , consisting of old men from the village , enters and persuades oedipus to leave the holy ground furthermore , he asks to see their king , theseus , saying , '' i come as someone sacred , someone filled with piety and power , bearing a great gift for all your people ismene tells her father that it is creon 's plan to come for him and bury him at the border of thebes , without proper burial rites , so that the power which the oracle says his grave will have will not be granted to any other land he pledges allegiance with neither of his feuding sons , but with the people of colonus , who thus far have treated him well , and further asks them for protection from creon after he relates his sorrowful story to them , theseus enters , and in contrast to the prying chorus states , '' i know all about you , son of laius theseus protests , saying that the two cities are friendly , and oedipus responds with what is perhaps the most famous speech in the play his men begin to carry them off toward thebes , perhaps planning to use them as blackmail to get oedipus to follow , out of a desire to return thebans to thebes , or simply out of anger the chorus then calls for theseus , who comes from sacrificing to poseidon to condemn creon , telling him , '' you have come to a city that practices justice , that sanctions nothing without law 341 creon replies by condemning oedipus , saying '' i knew your city would never harbor a father-killer.worse , a creature so corrupt , exposed as the mate , the unholy husband of his own mother he knows that this is the result of oedipus 's curse on his sons and begs his father to relent , even going so far as to say to his father , '' we share the same fate filled with strength , the blind oedipus stands and walks , calling for his children and theseus to follow him then he sent his children away , for only theseus could know the place of his death and pass it on to his heir antigone longs to see her father 's tomb , even to be buried there with him rather than live without him the women beg theseus to take them , but he reminds them that the place is a secret and that no one may go there there is less action in this play than in oedipus rex , and more philosophical discussion thebes is often used in athenian dramas as a city in which proper boundaries and identities are not maintained , allowing the playwright to explore themes like incest , murder , and hubris in a safe setting while the two other plays about oedipus often bring up the theme of a person 's moral responsibility for their destiny , and whether it is possible to rebel against destiny , oedipus at colonus shows oedipus 's resolution of the problem in '' oedipus rex , '' he was told by tiresias , '' you bear your fate and i will bear mine , '' a message repeated by the chorus , but scorned by oedipus , who like his father has believed he can escape his fate in '' oedipus at colonus , '' he declares that even though fate , which literally means '' necessity '' in ancient greek , is something we must suffer as beyond our choice in its power of necessity and is not a person 's creation , we must also find a way to work with it the key line in the play is when oedipus declares , '' let us not fight necessity , '' and antigone adds , '' for you will never see in all the world a man whom god has let escape his destiny ! '' oedipus at colonus suggests that , in breaking divine law , a ruler 's limited understanding may lead him to believe himself fully innocent ; however , his lack of awareness does not change the objective fact of his guilt it can be viewed as a transitional piece from the oedipus of oedipus rex whose acts were abominable to the oedipus we see at the end of oedipus at colonus , who is so powerful that he is sought after by two separate major cities the major image used to show this transition from beggar to hero is oedipus ' relationship with the sacred grove of the erinyes at the beginning of the play , oedipus has to be led through the grove by antigone and is only allowed to go through it because as a holy place it is an asylum for beggars he has given up his habit of trying to fight divine will ( as was his wont in oedipus rex ) and now is no longer fighting prophecies , but is accepting this grove as the place of his death oedipus then hints at his supernatural power , an ability to bring success to those who accept him and suffering to those who turned him away oedipus ' daughter ismene then arrives , bringing news that thebes , the city that once exiled oedipus for his sins , wants him back for his hero status ismene furthers oedipus ' status as a hero when she performs a libation to the erinyes , but his status is fully cemented when he chooses a hidden part of the sacred grove as his final resting place , which even his daughters ca n't know
