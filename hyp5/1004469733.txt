at the time of construction , the only traffic bridge linking the brisbane cbd and south brisbane was the second victoria bridge , built in 1897 to replace an earlier bridge washed away in the flood of 1893 on the south bank , aboriginal and later european pathways and land use patterns formed the basis for subsequent traffic networks the extension on the main line railway from ipswich to brisbane in 1875 isolated the strip of riverfront residences from the working-class houses in milton and paddington , and this contributed to the relative lack of development along the northern bank of the milton reach of the river in subsequent years the opening of the victoria bridge on 15 june 1874 provided an important transport and communications link between the north and south banks of the river , and provided further impetus to the development of the south bank the spread of housing included the development of large residences located along the ridges with views of the river , and industry developed along the southern bank of the milton reach '' urban expansion on both sides of the river continued with the opening of the new victoria bridge in 1897 and the trams in brisbane from 1908 the city of south brisbane tried to bring all the wharves in the south brisbane reach under its control and encouraged further commercial and industrial development along the river front as a result , when the time came to resume land in connection with the construction of the grey street bridge , there was scant opposition by the time greater brisbane was formed in 1925 , the need for further cross river links had been established in 1922 , the need for additional traffic on victoria bridge was identified , and the mayor of brisbane noted the need for cross river traffic as pressing and urgent the victoria bridge structure was investigated in 1923 to determine its strength for further loading , and walter james doak , bridge engineer of the queensland railways , noted that the bridge is now loaded to rather more than its orthodox capacity under live load , but it was considered that there was no immediate danger of collapse his recommendations included various repairs , and that a second bridge should be built , and the need for a railway bridge was also discussed these reports proposed the grey street bridge be two level for road and rail traffic , and a second bridge from wellington road to sydney street , new farm , with a major ring road called the main parkway boulevard , be constructed however , gilchrist avenue ( named after ef gilchrist city engineer ) , which is on the other side of the rail line to the proposed main parkway boulevard , is in essence part of the proposed traffic system for the grey street bridge as per earle 's recommended ring road system the council called applications for a bridge engineer to design a steel or reinforced concrete bridge on 10 july 1926 problems were encountered with the design of the bridge due to the depth of rock below the river bed increasing from approximately on the southern bank due to the costly foundation work , a bridge type with long spans was chosen the final decision of the type of bridge , from the five under consideration , was essentially aesthetic , and was influenced by the so-called rainbow arch bridge , carrying robert street , st paul , minnesota across the mississippi river '' the selected bridge design differed from the st paul bridge in that it has three major spans whereas the st paul bridge only has one , and this has been suggested as possibly making the william jolly bridge unique this caused dismay , and the commissioner for main roads considered that the cost should be contained to Â£500,000 by reducing the north quay roadworks , minimising resumptions and building a different type of bridge an artist 's impression at the time of construction shows trams crossing the bridge with overhead cables , a monument of some kind at the intersection of skew and saul streets , and a different number of viaducts on southern side to those actually built the southern approach spans piers founded on timber piles all driven to rock , or to such depths as it was possible to drive them without damage , and the river piers are founded on reinforced concrete caissons i was so much taken up with it that i got out of bed and commenced to design a scheme to carry out the piers for the grey street bridge the foundations for the bridge were very deep , and the experience gained in the construction of this bridge , and later the story bridge , was considered of great value and to be a major achievement it was only in the 1920s that the process spread internationally , and it is difficult to ascertain whether other examples of bridges using the gunite process , beside the st paul minnesota bridge , exist it would appear that the use of gunite in the arches , beams , deck members and hangers of the main spans , is a major early use of the process in australia '' the southern approach of the bridge , to the south of montague road , was designed to have wider footpaths and roadway than the remainder of the bridge to conform with the decision of the council to utilise this portion of the approach , so that access might be had to abutting buildings ( directly ) from the bridge roadway the extent of work included in the bridge contract excluded some retaining walls , roadways etc although there was widespread public interest in the bridge , it was eclipsed within ten years by the much larger and more prominent story bridge it is noted that those living in brisbane tend to regard this as normal for a bridge of this type ; however this is in fact most unusual and few bridges around the world , including the sydney harbour bridge , have this feature the bridge was designed to alleviate the traffic on the victoria bridge , but by as early as 1939 it was carrying 45 % of the cross river traffic and was effectively doing more than it was designed to achieve the bridge carries four lanes of traffic with pedestrian paths to either side , and retaining walls return at right angles to the bridge at the northern end supporting north quay above street lighting has been installed along the length of the bridge , and traffic lights are located at the northern end although designed to reduce congestion on the existing victoria bridge and within the cbd , the bridge created new congestion issues of its own , as it put considerable pressure on the normanby fiveways intersection making it one of brisbane 's most congested and dangerous intersections the go between bridge , opened in 2010 , was intended to relieve some of the congestion on the william jolly bridge ; however it has not achieve the level of use anticipated and operates under capacity , possibly because the go between bridge is a toll bridge while the nearby william jolly bridge remains free to use the william jolly bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of greater brisbane in 1925 , and was one of the first major capital works of the new city council being part of a bold policy of civic improvements under the provisions of the greater brisbane act it was brisbane 's second traffic bridge and provided an important transport and communications link between both sides of the river , as well as further impetus for the development of the south brisbane peninsula the design of the bridge is unusual in its use of three major spans of arched ribs which rise through the deck , which give the bridge a distinctive appearance and a landmark quality the design of the bridge is unusual in its use of three major spans of arched ribs which rise through the deck , which give the bridge a distinctive appearance and a landmark quality the william jolly bridge demonstrates a high degree of technical achievement in its design , its use of gunite ( sprayed dry mix concrete ) , and in the development of the sand island method used for the construction of its river piers
