this important case represented an immediate challenge to the civil rights act of 1964 , the landmark piece of civil rights legislation which represented the first comprehensive act by congress on civil rights and race relations since the civil rights act of 1875 for much of the 100 years preceding 1964 , african americans in the united states had been dominated by racial segregation , a system of racial separation which , while in name providing for '' separate but equal '' treatment of both white and african americans , in deed provided inferior accommodation , services , and treatment for african americans despite the outcomes of these cases , segregation remained in full effect into the 1960s in parts of the southern united states , where the heart of atlanta motel was located in direct violation of the terms of the civil rights act of 1964 , which banned racial discrimination in public places , largely based on congress 's control of interstate commerce , the motel refused to rent rooms to african-american patrons in addition , rolleston maintained that it violated his fifth amendment rights to choose customers and operate his business as he wished and resulted in unjust deprivation of his property without due process of law and just compensation in response , archibald cox , the solicitor general of the united states , countered that the restrictions requiring adequate accommodation for african americans were unquestionably related to interstate travel and that congress , under the constitution 's commerce clause , certainly had the power to address such a matter in law cox also mentioned that areas that do not practice equal opportunity are often overlooked by companies that seek commercial and industrial expansion due to the possibility of demonstrations â€” archibald cox he further argued that the fifth amendment does not forbid reasonable regulation of interstate commerce and that such incidental damage did not constitute the '' taking '' of property without just compensation or due process of law lastly , he asserted that the thirteenth amendment applies primarily to slavery and the removal of widespread disabilities associated with it and so it undoubtedly would not place issues of racial discrimination in public accommodations beyond the reach of federal and state law : but surely it would turn the world quite upside down for anyone to seriously suggest that the thirteenth amendment was intended to prohibit either congress or the state governments from guaranteeing negroes equality of treatment in places of public accommodation the case was combined with the case of the future governor of georgia lester maddox , regarding his pickrick restaurant and his refusal to serve african americans supreme court held that congress acted well within its authority under the commerce clause in passing the civil rights act of 1964 , thereby upholding the act 's title ii in question united states has been cited in at least 690 other case decisions since its ruling , including multiple other supreme court cases
