in canada , there are four drug schedules : schedule 1 : requires a prescription for sale and is provided to the public by a licensed pharmacist these drugs are kept in an area of the pharmacy where there is no public access and may also be referred to as '' behind-the-counter '' drugs these drugs are kept in an area of the retail outlet where self-selection is possible , but a pharmacist must be available to assist in the self-selection of medication if required all medications other than schedule 1 may be considered an otc drug , as they do not require prescriptions for sale prior to this , the general assumption was that any drug which did not fall into a prescription schedule could be purchased without a prescription the fda requires that all '' new drugs '' obtain a new drug application ( nda ) before entering interstate commerce , but the act exempts any drugs generally recognized as safe and effective ( gras/e ) to deal with the vast number of otc drugs that were already on the market before the requirement that all drugs obtain an nda , the fda created the otc monograph system to review classes of drugs and to categorize them as gras/e after review by expert panels certain classes of otc drugs would not be required to obtain an nda and could remain on the market if they conformed to the monograph guidelines for doses , labeling , and warnings finalized in the code of federal regulations drug applications for over-the-counter ( otc ) drugs there is also the possibility that certain otc drug products are marketed under the grandfathering provisions of the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act , but the fda has never formally acknowledged that any legitimate grandfathered otc drug exists for example , many drugstores have moved products containing pseudoephedrine , an otc product , into locations where customers must ask a pharmacist for them after initial attempts to control methamphetamine use ( by requiring documentation of sale with government issued id as well as limits on the quantity an individual could purchase ) failed to realize meaningful reductions in methamphetamine use and production , mississippi passed house bill 512 in the state senate on february 2 , 2010 '' to require a prescription from a licensed medical professional to purchase over-the-counter medicines with pseudoephedrine , ephedrine , or any other precursor chemical that can readily and illicitly be converted into methamphetamine , methcathinone or any active/scheduled analogs of phenylethylamines/ amphetamine '' however , products containing the substance are still otc in most states , since no prescription is required such drugs are sold without a prescription but are subject to record-keeping rules and quantity and/or age restrictions , and they must be dispensed by a pharmacy finally , pharmacies frequently require a prescription for schedule v drugs as a matter of policy , despite their otc status according to applicable laws and regulations these medicines are often sold by drug dealers , especially those marked as '' cd pom , '' which are controlled due to abuse risk such as dipipanone , temazepam , and methadone ' p ' medications are reserved from the gsl list as they are either associated with a need for advice on use , or used in conditions which may require referral to a medical prescriber a prescription is not required for p medicines , and pharmacy sales assistants are required by royal pharmaceutical society codes to ask certain questions , which varies for what the customer says otc drugs are usually also required to have little or no abuse potential , although in some areas drugs such as codeine are available otc ( usually in strictly limited formulations or requiring paperwork or identification to be submitted during purchase ) over time , often 3â€“6 years , drugs that prove themselves safe and appropriate as prescription medicines may be switched from prescription to otc the study concluded that a small percentage of consumers prefer having access to medication over potential risks of taking non-prescribed medication
