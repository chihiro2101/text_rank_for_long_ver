also of note are other smaller bogs in sinkholes , like the grundloses moor ( '' bottomless bog '' ) near walsrode or the bullenkuhle near bokel ( part of sprakensehl ) during the saalian stage ( 230,000–130,000 years ago ) the area of the present-day lüneburg heath was covered three times by a continental ice sheet in the last glacial period ( 110,000–10,000 years ago ) the ice sheet no longer covered the lüneburg heath area ; it reached only as far as the river elbe in contrast to the areas in the north of lüneburg heath , the landscape is very hilly , as it is placed on a terminal moraine lüneburg heath is divided into the following natural sub-divisions : hohe heide : the hohe heide ( '' high heath '' ) consists of a series of end moraines from the glaciers of the saalian glaciation ( 230,000–130,000 years ago ) with the wilseder berg at its heart there are still large areas of heath on the bergen-hohne training area and munster ( örtze ) ; these are out-of-bounds to visitors however the osterheide near schneverdingen also belongs to this natural subdivision the northern area , the so-called göhrde and the drawehn , are by contrast mostly wooded like the southern ridge of end moraine on the surrounding ridges there are also a few pine forests however there are still large areas of heath here as well , for example the ellerndorfer heide ( '' ellerndorf heath '' ) in western uelzen district or the klein bünstorfer heide ( '' klein bünstorf heath '' ) at its heart , around the wilseder berg , is the lüneburg heath nature reserve ( naturschutzgebiet or nsg ) founded as long ago as 1921 with of land which is roughly 58 % woods and 20 % heathland right in the north of the area is the harburg hills nature park the lüneburg heath nsg , together with the open heathland of the huge munster training area and the bergen-hohne training area , is the largest single area of heathland in central europe left image : lüneburger heide - 043.jpg thumb left path near undeloh image : bodenprofil heide.jpg thumb left soil profile of heath podsol showing the hardpan after the end of the weichselian ice age ( 115,000 to 10,000 years ago ) the first woods appeared in the area that now forms lüneburg heath which , following the natural ecological succession and encouraged by a gradual improvement in the climate , progressed from birch and pine trees through hazel woods to light woods of sessile oaks the heath and its surrounding area belong to those regions of the north german plain in which the hunter culture of the mesolithic era was superseded quite early on by neolithic farmers by about 3000 bc , during the neolithic , large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating , sandy stretches of geest on lüneburg heath this was a result of the intensive grazing of the sessile oak woods and the associated destruction of successive new stands of trees nevertheless , oak and beech woods succeeded time and again in establishing themselves wherever man left areas of heath untended over a long period of time the region of lüneburg heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed the typical heath farming economy emerged : due to the poor soils the few available nutrients from a large area were concentrated on relatively small fields , from which grain , in particular , could be produced the oft-expressed view in the literature that the heath arose in the middle ages as a result of the demand for wood by the lüneburg salt pans is incorrect the lüneburg salt ponds certainly needed firewood for the production of salt , but they did not appear until around 1000 ad , by which time the heath had already been around for 4,000 years the amount required , even in the heyday of production , could have been continuously supplied by an area of woodland about 50 & nbsp ; km 2 in area , yet the heath covers over 7000 & nbsp ; km 2 in any case the wood certainly did not come from the heath , but via the waterways , especially from mecklenburg up the elbe and from the area of the schaalsee transportation overland would have been far too expensive ( apart from the river ilmenau which was navigable at the time , no rivers flow from the main areas of heathland to lüneburg ) , as can be seen not only from some of the delivery notes which still survive , but also from the fact that there are still large woods around lüneburg itself , such as the göhrde in order to prevent its semi-open heathland from being repopulated by trees , especially pines and , to a lesser extent , silver birches , which would cause the loss of this millennia-old environment and its many inhabitants , including often very rare animal and plant species , sheep are allowed to graze it regularly ; these are almost exclusively the local german moorland sheep , the heidschnucke in the 20th century , numerous conservation measures were implemented on lüneburg heath ; as a result , it is one of the best researched regions of central europe sand heaths form about 20 % of the lüneburg heath nature reserve and may be broken down into further sub-divisions , the most important being : thumb ; ordinary sand heath ( typische sandheide , genisto-callunetum ) in addition to the common heather ( calluna vulgaris ) only a few taller plants occur here , none of which can be classed as characteristic species this type of heath is found west of niederhaverbeck and near sundermühlen this type of heath is particularly characteristic of the northern slopes of the wilseder berg , as well as the steingrund and totengrund it occurs in places close to the water table and in the transition zone around bogs its primary locations are areas north of wilsede and near the hörpel ponds ( hörpeler teichen ) left image : lüneburger heide - hutewald 001.jpg thumb the hutewald ( wood pasture ) near wilsede thumb the greater part ( about 58 % ) of the lüneburg heath nature reserve consists of woods , primarily pine forests , which were planted in the second half of the 19th century on former heathland and drifting sand many species of animal live on lüneburg heath , particularly birds that are at home in the wide , open landscape , some of which are seriously threatened by the intensive-farming techniques in other areas palynology show that the dry geest soils of north germany have been cultivated since about 3000 bc but even in the lüneburg heath nature reserve there are more than a thousand tumuli , especially near nieder- and oberhaverbeck image : dat ole hus 003.jpg thumb wilsede heath museum – a typical timber-framed hall house ( fachhallenhaus ) lüneburg heath was always relatively sparsely populated due to the poor soils in the area the region was dominated by heath farming which was a less intensive form of land usage necessary for its large areas of barren terrain and heathland see also : naturpark südheide heideimkerei the villages were usually encircled by small tracts of woodland , sometimes interrupted by fields or meadows , and merged without clear boundaries into the surrounding landscape the farms themselves , however , were very large in wilsede all the features of a heath village described here may still be seen wilsede heath museum ( heidemuseum wilsede ) was established in a fachhallenhaus and it gives an insight into the working and living conditions of a heathland farm around 1850 in rural parts of the region they still sometimes use today a low german dialect called heidjerisch in 1800 , large parts of northwest germany had been covered with heaths and bog today , by contrast the only large , continuous areas of heath remaining are in the lüneburg heath nature reserve and on a few military training areas around 1900 , there were growing demands to save the heathland and bogs of northwest germany , which were threatened by reforestation and drainage the area of lüneburg heath near wilsede was selected as the location for the north german national park thumb between 1891 and the second world war , large military training areas were established on lüneburg heath , including the largest one in europe , the bergen-hohne training area on the südheide a large area of the nature park belonging to the society near schneverdingen was taken over by the british army of the rhine in 1945 for use as a tank training area contributing to this are the theme park , heidepark soltau , the walsrode bird park , the serengeti park at hodenhagen , snow dome bispingen , and a center parc as well as the many farms offering holiday stays , making the lüneburg heath especially popular for families
