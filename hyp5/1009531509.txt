leopold could not meet the costs of running the congo free state shortly after the anti-slavery conference he held in brussels in 1889 , leopold issued a new decree which said that africans could only sell their harvested products ( mostly ivory and rubber ) to the state in a large part of the free state any ivory or rubber collected from the state-owned land , the reasoning went , must belong to the state ; creating a de facto state-controlled monopoly suddenly , the only outlet a large share of the local population had for their products was the state , which could set purchase prices and therefore could control the amount of income the congolese could receive for their work however , for local elites this system presented new opportunities as the free state and concession companies paid them with guns to tax their subjects in kind their protests against the violation of free trade prompted leopold to take another , less obvious tack to make money each company was given a large amount of land in the congo free state on which to collect rubber and ivory for sale in europe these companies were allowed to detain africans who did not work hard enough , to police their vast areas as they saw fit and to take all the products of the forest for themselves the free trade zone in the congo was open to entrepreneurs of any european nation , who were allowed to buy 10- & nbsp ; and 15-year monopoly leases on anything of value : ivory from a district or the rubber concession , for example rubber revenue went directly to leopold who paid the free state for the high costs of exploitation the second , a much smaller force of only eight-hundred , was led by louis-napoléon chaltin and took the main road towards rejaf although leopold ii had initially planned for the expedition to carry on much farther than the lado enclave , hoping indeed to take fashoda and then khartoum , batetela rebellion in february 1897 , resulting in the death of several belgian officers and the loss of his entire force district officials ' salaries were reduced to a bare minimum , and made up with a commission payment based on the profit that their area returned to leopold congolese communities in the domaine privé were not merely forbidden by law to sell items to anyone but the state ; they were required to provide state officials with set quotas of rubber and ivory at a fixed , government-mandated price and to provide food to the local post this project , known today as the matadi–kinshasa railway , took years to complete to monopolize the resources of the entire congo free state , leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that reduced the native population to serfs collectively , these forced the natives to deliver all ivory and rubber , harvested or found , to state officers thus nearly completing leopold 's monopoly of the ivory and rubber trade early on , the fp was used primarily to campaign against the arab slave trade in the upper congo , protect leopold 's economic interests , and suppress the frequent uprisings within the state in addition , leopold had been actually encouraging the slave trade among arabs in the upper congo in return for slaves to fill the ranks of the fp many of the black soldiers were from far-off peoples of the upper congo , while others had been kidnapped in raids on villages in their childhood and brought to roman catholic missions , where they received a military training in conditions close to slavery this was all contrary to the promises of uplift made at the berlin conference which had recognized the congo free state meanwhile , the force publique were required to provide the hand of their victims as proof when they had shot and killed someone , as it was believed that they would otherwise use the munitions ( imported from europe at considerable cost ) for hunting after seeing a congolese person killed for the first time , a danish missionary wrote , '' the soldier said 'do n't take this to heart so much in forbath 's words : the baskets of severed hands , set down at the feet of the european post commanders , became the symbol of the congo free state the collection of hands became an end in itself a reduction of the population of the congo is noted by all who have compared the country at the beginning of leopold 's control with the beginning of belgian state rule in 1908 , but estimates of the death toll vary considerably in the absence of a census providing even an initial idea of the size of population of the region at the inception of the congo free state ( the first was taken in 1924 ) , it is impossible to quantify population changes in the period hochschild cites several recent independent lines of investigation , by anthropologist jan vansina and others , that examine local sources ( police records , religious records , oral traditions , genealogies , personal diaries ) , which generally agree with the assessment of the 1919 belgian government commission : roughly half the population perished during the free state period since the first official census by the belgian authorities in 1924 put the population at about 10 million , these various approaches suggest a rough estimate of a total of 10 million dead jan vansina returned to the issue of quantifying the total population decline , and revised his earlier position , he concluded that the kuba population ( one of the many congolese populations ) was rising during the first two decades of leopold ii 's rule , and declined with 25 percent from 1900 to 1919 , mainly due to sickness louis and stengers state that population figures at the start of leopold 's control are only '' wild guesses '' , while calling e as competition from other areas of rubber cultivation mounted , leopold 's private rule was left increasingly vulnerable to international scrutiny eye-witness reports from missionaries portrayed actions by the state that broke laws set by the european nations however , it is likely that the case was decided in favor of sheppard as a result of international politics ; the u.s reporting back to the foreign office in 1900 , casement wrote : the root of the evil lies in the fact that the government of the congo is above all a commercial trust , that everything else is orientated towards commercial gain & nbsp ; guinness 's assistance , he set up and ran the congo reform association , which worked to end leopold 's control of the congo free state branches of the association were established as far away as the united states the mass deaths in the congo free state became a cause célèbre in the last years of the 19th century one of the main ways england was involved in ending leopold ii of belgium ’ s rule in the congo , was by making belgium , as a whole , more aware of the brutality present in the congo morel was one of the key activists of england for a congo free from belgium rule once the u.s became aware of the occurrences in the congo , morel began the congo reform association one of the methods morel used to make the world more aware of the atrocities in the congo during leopold ’ s rule was through the press articles were published in both magazines and newspapers in order to make the people of these powerful countries , such as the u.s and england , more aware of what truly was being done in this part of africa individuals such as george washington williams also had a significant impact on the congo free state propaganda war in his famous letter , '' an open letter to his serene majesty léopold ii , king of the belgians and sovereign of the independent state of congo '' , sent on july 18 , 1890 , williams described in great detail the crimes committed against the residents of the congo and their overall mistreatment leopold ii offered to reform his congo free state regime , but international opinion supported an end to the king 's rule , and no nation was willing to accept this responsibility yielding to international pressure , the parliament of belgium annexed the congo free state and took over its administration on november 15 , 1908 , as the colony of the belgian congo despite being effectively removed from power , the international scrutiny was no major loss to leopold ii—who died in brussels on 17 december 1909—or to the concessionary companies in the congo leopold ii lost the absolute power he had had there , but the population now had a belgian colonial regime , which had become heavily paternalism , with church , state , and private companies all instructed to oversee the welfare of the inhabitants the order of the crown , originally created in 1897 , rewarded heroic deeds and service achieved while serving in the congo free state the order was made a decoration of the belgian state with the abolition of the congo free state in 1908 and is still awarded today in the aftermath of the 1998 publication of king leopold 's ghost by adam hochschild , where he had written '' the killing in the congo was of genocidal proportions '' , but '' it was not strictly speaking a genocide '' , the guardian reported that the royal museum for central africa in brussels would finance an investigation into some of the claims made by hochschild critics , including hochschild , claimed that there were '' distortions and evasions '' in the exhibition and stated : '' the exhibit deals with this question in a wall panel misleadingly headed 'genocide in the congo ?
