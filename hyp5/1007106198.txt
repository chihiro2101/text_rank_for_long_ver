the user or machine sends a request to a network access server ( nas ) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials rfc 2865 remote authentication dial in user service ( radius ) this request includes access credentials , typically in the form of username and password or security certificate provided by the user additionally , the request may contain other information which the nas knows about the user , such as its network address or phone number , and information regarding the user 's physical point of attachment to the nas the user 's proof of identification is verified , along with , optionally , other information related to the request , such as the user 's network address or phone number , account status , and specific network service access privileges access challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the radius server in a way that the access credentials are hidden from the nas once the user is authenticated , the radius server will often check that the user is authorized to use the network service requested a given user may be allowed to use a company 's wireless network , but not its vpn service , for example again , this information may be stored locally on the radius server , or may be looked up in an external source such as ldap or active directory for example , the following authorization attributes may be included in an access-accept : the specific ip address to be assigned to the user the address pool from which the user 's ip address should be chosen the maximum length of time that the user may remain connected an access list , priority queue or other restrictions on a user 's access l2tp parameters vlan parameters quality of service ( qos ) parameters when a client is configured to use radius , any user of the client presents authentication information to the client when network access is granted to the user by the nas , an accounting start ( a radius accounting request packet containing an acct-status-type attribute with the value '' start '' ) is sent by the nas to the radius server to signal the start of the user 's network access '' start '' records typically contain the user 's identification , network address , point of attachment and a unique session identifier finally , when the user 's network access is closed , the nas issues a final accounting stop record ( a radius accounting request packet containing an acct-status-type attribute with the value '' stop '' ) to the radius server , providing information on the final usage in terms of time , packets transferred , data transferred , reason for disconnect and other information related to the user 's network access the primary purpose of this data is that the user can be billed accordingly ; the data is also commonly used for statistical purposes and for general network monitoring
