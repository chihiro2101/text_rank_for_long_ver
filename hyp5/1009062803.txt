little is known about ferdowsi 's early life the dehqans were attached to the pre-islamic literary heritage , as their status was associated with it ( so much so that dehqan is sometimes used as a synonym for '' iranian '' in the shahnameh ) ferdowsi grew up in tus , a city under the control of one of these dynasties , the samanids , who claimed descent from the sassanid general bahram chobin ( whose story ferdowsi recounts in one of the later sections of the shahnameh ) the samanid bureaucracy used the new persian language , which had been used to bring islam to the eastern regions of the iranian world and supplanted local languages , and commissioned translations of pahlavi texts into new persian although it no longer survives , ferdowsi used it as one of the sources of his epic mahmud 's attitude to ferdowsi and how well he rewarded the poet are matters which have long been subject to dispute and have formed the basis of legends about the poet and his patron ( see below ) the turkic mahmud may have been less interested in tales from iranian history than the samanids after ferdowsi 's shahnameh , a number of other works similar in nature surfaced over the centuries within the cultural sphere of the persian language many modern iranians see him as the father of the modern persian language ferdowsi in fact was a motivation behind many future persian figures one such notable figure was rez훮 sh훮h pahlavi , who established an academy of persian language and literature , in order to attempt to remove arabic and french words from the persian language , replacing them with suitable persian alternatives in 1934 , rez훮 sh훮h set up a ceremony in mashhad , khorasan , celebrating a thousand years of persian literature since the time of ferdowsi , titled '' ferdowsi millennial celebration '' , inviting notable european as well as iranian scholars for nearly a thousand years they have continued to read and to listen to recitations from his masterwork , the shah-nameh , in which the persian national epic found its final and enduring form though written about 1,000 years ago , this work is as intelligible to the average , modern iranian as the king james version of the bible is to a modern english-speaker
