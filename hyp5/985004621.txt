a variety of different morphological forms appear in the life cycles of trypanosomatids , distinguished mainly by the position , length and the cell body attachment of the flagellum the kinetoplast is found closely associated with the basal body at the base of the flagellum and all species of trypanosomatid have a single nucleus most of these morphologies can be found as a life cycle stage in all trypanosomatid genera however certain morphologies are particularly common in a particular genus the various morphologies were originally named from the genus where the morphology was commonly found , although this terminology is now rarely used because of potential confusion between morphologies and genus for example , the amastigote ( prefix '' a- '' , meaning no flagellum ) form is also known as the leishmanial form as all leishmania have an amastigote life cycle stage leishmania amastigoes are particularly small and are among the smallest eukaryotic cells the promastigote form is a common morphology in the insect host epimastigotes are a common form in the insect host and crithidia and blastocrithidia , both parasites of insects , exhibit this form during their life cycles this stage is characteristic of the genus trypanosoma in the mammalian host bloodstream as well as infective metacyclic stages in the fly vector
