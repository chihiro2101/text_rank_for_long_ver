to show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one-fifteenth the cost of a viking mission the mars pathfinder conducted different investigations on the martian soil using three scientific instruments the lander contained a stereo camera with spatial filters on an expandable pole called imager for mars pathfinder ( imp ) , and the atmospheric structure instrument/meteorology package ( asi/met ) which acts as a mars meteorological station , collecting data about pressure , temperature , and winds the rover also had two black-and-white cameras and a color one a third camera with the same resolution but taking color images was located on the back , near the apxs , and rotated by 90° it provided images of the apxs 's target area and the rover 's tracks on the ground scientists chose it because they found it to be a relatively safe surface to land on and one that contained a wide variety of rocks deposited during a catastrophic flood when the lander reached 1.6 & nbsp ; km above the surface , a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity this information was used by the computer to determine the precise timing of the landing events that followed once the lander was 355 m above the ground , airbags were inflated in less than a second using three gas generators the lander 's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0 & nbsp ; m/s between 15 and 25 & nbsp ; m above the ground designed to right itself from any initial orientation , the lander happened to roll right side up onto its base petal the lander had to wait until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to earth during sol 1 , the first martian solar day the lander spent on the planet , the lander took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements once the data was received , the engineers realized that one of the airbags had n't fully deflated and could be a problem for the forthcoming traverse of sojourners descent ramp the rover made measurements of the elements found in those rocks and in the martian soil , while the lander took pictures of the sojourner and the surrounding terrain , in addition to making climate observations ( see also space exploration rovers ) the apxs ( apxs ) was used to determine its composition , the spectrometer taking ten hours to make a full scan of the sample another rock , named moe , was found to have certain marks on its surface , demonstrating erosion caused by the wind by the time that final results of the mission were described in a series of articles in the journal science ( december 5 , 1997 ) , it was believed that the rock yogi contained a coating of dust , but was similar to the rock barnacle bill the mission was jeopardised by a concurrent software bug in the lander , parallel sparking : many chips make light work , douglas heaven , new scientist magazine , issue 2930 , august 19 , 2013 , p44 the lander sent more than 2.3 billion bits ( 287.5 megabytes ) of information including 16,500 pictures and made 8.5 million measurements of the atmospheric pressure , temperature and wind speed by taking multiple images of the sky at different distances from the sun , scientists were able to determine that the size of the particles in the pink haze was about one micrometre in radius 1758–1765 pathfinder carried a series of magnets to examine the magnetic component of the dust using much more sophisticated instruments , spirit rover found that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on mars using doppler tracking and two-way ranging , scientists added earlier measurements from the viking landers to determine that the non-hydrostatic component of the polar moment of inertia is due to the tharsis bulge and that the interior is not melted during the extended operation a high-resolution stereo panorama of the surrounding terrain was being made , and the sojourner rover was to visit a distant ridge , but the panorama was only about one-third completed and the ridge visit had not begun when communication failed the opening title sequence of the television series star trek : enterprise features footage of sojourner on the martian surface , intermixed with various other images representative of humankind 's evolution of air and space flight super-resolution stereo pairs of '' twin peaks '' mars pathfinder mission profile by nasa 's solar system exploration ted stryk 's mars pathfinder page '' a crawl on mars '' —ted stryk 's sojourner rover page nasa office of space science jpl—mars exploration rover mission authoritative account of mpf reset issue—discussion of the software problems on the pathfinder spacecraft a little rock on mars—children 's story about the pathfinder landing pathfinder landing site as seen from orbit by mars reconnaissance orbiter paper model ( source ) magnetic properties experiment
