with minor improvements to the first prototypes , energy density rapidly increased to about half of that of primary batteries , and significantly greater than lead–acid batteries in general , the greater amount of reactive material surface area in a battery , the lower its internal resistance 5–6 minutes of model operation is easily achievable from quite small batteries , so a reasonably high power-to-weight figure is achieved , comparable to internal combustion motors , though of lesser duration because many electronic devices are designed to work with primary cells that may discharge to as low as 0.90 to 1.0 & nbsp ; v per cell , the relatively steady 1.2 & nbsp ; v of a ni–cd cell is enough to allow operation some would consider the near-constant voltage a drawback as it makes it difficult to detect when the battery charge is low ni–cd batteries can be charged at several different rates , depending on how the cell was manufactured regardless of the charge speed , more energy must be supplied to the battery than its actual capacity , to account for energy loss during charging , with faster charges being more efficient it is possible to perform a trickle charge at current levels just high enough to offset this discharge rate ; to keep a battery fully charged since the vessel is designed to contain an exact amount of electrolyte this loss will rapidly affect the capacity of the cell and its ability to receive and deliver current this is known as the jelly-roll design and allows a ni–cd cell to deliver a much higher maximum current than an equivalent size alkaline cell as a relatively small area of the electrode is in contact with the electrolyte ( as opposed to the jelly-roll design ) , the internal resistance for an equivalent sized alkaline cell is higher which limits the maximum current that can be delivered traditional nicd batteries are of the sealed type , which means that charge gas is normally recombined and they release no gas unless severely overcharged or a fault develops using vented cell nicd batteries results in reduction in size , weight and maintenance requirements over other types of batteries the specific gravity of the electrolyte does not indicate if the battery is discharged or fully charged but changes mainly with evaporation of water vented cell voltage rises rapidly at the end of charge allowing for very simple charger circuitry to be used typically a battery is constant current charged at 1 ca rate until all the cells have reached at least 1.55 v when ni–cd batteries are substituted for primary cells , the lower terminal voltage and smaller ampere-hour capacity may reduce performance as compared to primary cells a fully charged single ni–cd cell , under no load , carries a potential difference of between 1.25 and 1.35 volts , which stays relatively constant as the battery is discharged since an alkaline battery near fully discharged may see its voltage drop to as low as 0.9 volts , ni–cd cells and alkaline cells are typically interchangeable for most applications however , the ni–cd battery is still very useful in applications requiring very high discharge rates because it can endure such discharge with no damage or loss of capacity when compared to other forms of rechargeable battery , the ni–cd battery has a number of distinct advantages : the batteries are more difficult to damage than other batteries , tolerating deep discharge for long periods this is in contrast , for example , to lithium ion battery , which are less stable and will be permanently damaged if discharged below a minimum voltage a ni–cd cell has a lower capacity than that of an equivalent alkaline cell , and costs more however , since the alkaline battery 's chemical reaction is not reversible , a reusable ni–cd battery has a significantly longer total lifetime since an alkaline battery 's voltage drops significantly as the charge drops , most consumer applications are well equipped to deal with the slightly lower ni–cd cell voltage with no noticeable loss of performance however , a ni–cd battery has a lower self-discharge rate ( for example , 20 % per month for a ni–cd battery , versus 30 % per month for a traditional nimh under identical conditions ) , although low self-discharge nimh battery are now available , which have substantially lower self-discharge than either ni–cd or traditional nimh batteries this results in a preference for ni–cd over non-lsd nimh batteries in applications where the current draw on the battery is lower than the battery 's own self-discharge rate ( for example , television remote controls ) finally , a similarly sized ni–cd battery has a slightly lower internal resistance , and thus can achieve a higher maximum discharge rate ( which can be important for applications such as power tools ) this can pose considerable charging problems , particularly with the relatively simple charging systems employed for lead–acid type batteries whilst lead–acid batteries can be charged by simply connecting a dynamo to them , with a simple electromagnetic cut-out system for when the dynamo is stationary or an over-current occurs , the ni–cd battery under a similar charging scheme would exhibit thermal runaway , where the charging current would continue to rise until the over-current cut-out operated or the battery destroyed itself this is the principal factor that prevents its use as engine-starting batteries some electronics designed to be powered by ni–cd batteries are able to withstand this reduced voltage long enough for the voltage to return to normal however , if the device is unable to operate through this period of decreased voltage , it will be unable to get enough energy out of the battery , and for all practical purposes , the battery appears '' dead '' earlier than normal after this time , it was found that the capacities of the batteries had declined significantly , but were still fit for use also it is possible to lower the memory effect by discharging the battery completely about once a month in rare cases , much of the lost capacity can be recovered by a few deep-discharge cycles , a function often provided by automatic battery chargers if treated well , a ni–cd battery can last for 1,000 cycles or more before its capacity drops below half its original capacity
