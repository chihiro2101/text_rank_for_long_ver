larceny laws in the united states have their roots in common law , pursuant to which larceny involves the trespassory taking ( caption ) and carrying away ( asportation , removal ) of the tangible personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of its possession under many states ' larceny statutes , including california , larceny can include the taking of '' money , labor , or real or personal property ( lexis 2001 ) a person has possession of property when he has actual physical control over the property ( actual possession ) or he has the right to exercise considerable control over the disposition or use of the property ( constructive possession ) a person has custody if he has actual physical control of the property , but the person who has constructive possession has substantially restricted the custodian 's right to use the property this is to be contrasted to , for example , a person who has obtained actual possession of the property by fraud ancient roman law ( first 50 years of written university law , possibly borrowing from greek law there is no copy of ) was more lax about '' simple possession '' ; it was assumed '' borrowing '' if there was no one to ask : unless or until other mitigating factors arose ( such as refusal to return promptly when asked ) the taking or caption element requires that the offender take actual physical control of the property , if but for a moment originally , the caption element required an actual physical taking of the property from the victim 's person this limitation existed because larceny 's original purpose was to punish breaches of peace rather than violations of property interests under the common law , it was not sufficient if the offender simply deprived the victim of possession ; the offender must have gained control over the property thus merely knocking an article from a person 's hand was not larceny , as long as the defendant did not thereafter take it these actions were held not to be larceny because the defendant never had complete control over the disposition and use of the coat the court held that the defendant 's control over the property , although momentary , was sufficient to constitute a taking the taking may be either direct or indirect ; that is , accomplished by the criminal himself or an innocent agent the equivalent term '' deprive '' is also sometimes used : the court read asportation as merely a corroborative element of possession and control , and thus not necessary to establish possession and control of a car because transportation is the purpose of a car the subject matter of larceny has been tangible personal property , for example , one can steal a person 's social security card and use the information to obtain a credit card and make transactions however , using the social security number is not larceny because the information , although of substantial value , is not tangible personal property for example , if a person stole the coca-cola formula , the crime would be larceny but the grade of the offense would be determined by the value of the paper on which the formula was recorded not the value of the recipe ( theft of trade secrets would be a different offense however , the common law stated that if the severance and carrying away of a fixture were one continuous act , no larceny would occur the defendant 's actions in this example would thus merely constitute damage to real property , and would further not result in possession of stolen property since no larceny had taken place the property taken must be '' of another '' therefore , it is possible for the person who has title to the property to steal the property from a person who had lawful possession a person who takes property of another under the mistaken belief that the property belongs to him does not have the requisite intent to steal ; nor does a person '' intend to steal '' property when he takes property intending to make temporary use of it and then return the property to the owner within a reasonable time thus , if the property taken has no economic value , it is not subject to larceny statutes under contemporary larceny laws , it is normally sufficient to support a larceny charge if the item has any value to the owner , even if its market value would be negligible for example , north carolina general statutes section 14 - 72 ( b ) ( 1 ) makes the crime of larceny a felony '' without regard to value '' if the larceny is ( 1 ) from the person ( 2 ) committed pursuant to certain types of breaking or enterings ( 3 ) of any explosive or incendiary device or ( 4 ) of any firearm first , in embezzlement , an actual conversion must occur ; second , the original taking must not be trespassory to say that the taking was not trespassory is to say that the person ( s ) performing the embezzlement had the right to possess , use , and/or access the assets in question , and that such person ( s ) subsequently secreted and converted the assets for an unintended and/or unsanctioned use it is important to make clear that embezzlement is not always a form of theft or an act of stealing , since those definitions specifically deal with taking something that does not belong to the perpetrator ( s ) to prove embezzlement , the state must show that the employee had possession of the goods '' by virtue of her employment '' ; that is , that the employee had the authority to exercise substantial control over the goods typically , in determining whether the employee had sufficient control the courts will look at factors such as the job title , job description and the particular employment practices the issue was whether a person who had fraudulently obtained possession of personal property ( a horse ) could be convicted of larceny the case would seem to have been cut and dried â€“ the doctrine of possessorial immunity applied and the defendant was therefore not guilty of larceny an employee is generally presumed to have custody rather than possession of property of his employer used during his employment however , officers , managers and employees who have significant authority over the disposition or use of the employer 's property have possession rather than custody and the misappropriation of the property would likely be embezzlement rather than larceny north carolina courts interpreted a statute passed by parliament in 1528 as creating an offense called '' larceny by employee '' ; an offense that was separate and distinct from common law larceny however , as perkins notes , the purpose of the statute was not to create a new offense but was merely to confirm that the acts described in the statute met the elements of common law larceny if a third party transfers possession of property to an employee for delivery to his employer , the employee has possession of the property and his conversion of the property would be embezzlement rather than larceny however , once the teller transfers possession of the money to his employer , by placing the money in the till for example , the subsequent taking would be larceny rather than embezzlement the same result would obtain if the thief stole items from the same victim over a period of time on the grounds that the stealing was pursuant to a common scheme or plan the effect would be that the state could aggregate the value of the various items taken in determining whether the crime was a felony or misdemeanor such a result would not always work to the criminal 's detriment aggregation is also generally permitted when the thief steals property from multiple victims at the same time
