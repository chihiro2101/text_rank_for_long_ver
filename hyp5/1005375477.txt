after his nobel prize award , edelman began research into the regulation of primary cellular processes , particularly the control of cell growth and the development of multi-celled organisms , focussing on cell-to-cell interactions in early embryonic development and in the formation and function of the nervous system these studies led to the discovery of cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) , which guide the fundamental processes that help an animal achieve its shape and form , and by which nervous systems are built one of the most significant discoveries made in this research is that the precursor gene for the neural cell adhesion molecule gave rise in evolution to the entire molecular system of adaptive immunity he decided that , since the book said so little about antibodies , he would investigate them further upon returning to the united states , which led him to study physical chemistry for his 1960 ph.d research by edelman and his colleagues and rodney robert porter in the early 1960s produced fundamental breakthroughs in the understanding of the antibody 's chemical structure , opening a door for further study in his later career , edelman was noted for his theory of consciousness , documented in a trilogy of technical books and in several subsequent books written for a general audience , including bright air , brilliant fire ( 1992 ) , a universe of consciousness ( 2001 , with giulio tononi ) , wider than the sky ( 2004 ) and second nature : brain science and human knowledge ( 2007 ) '' the first of edelman 's technical books , the mindful brain ( 1978 ) , develops his theory of neural darwinism , which is built around the idea of plasticity in the neural network in response to the environment the second book , topobiology ( 1988 ) , proposes a theory of how the original neuronal network of a newborn 's brain is established during development of the embryo in his books , edelman proposed a biological theory of consciousness , based on his studies of the immune system he explicitly located his theory within charles darwin 's theory of natural selection , citing the key tenets of darwin 's population theory , which postulates that individual variation within species provides the basis for the natural selection that eventually leads to the evolution of new species the young brain contains many more neurons than will ultimately survive to maturity , and edelman argued that this redundant capacity is needed because neurons are the only cells in the body that can not be renewed and because only those cells and networks best adapted to their ultimate purpose will be selected as they organize into neuronal groups edelman 's theory of neuronal group selection , also known as 'neural darwinism ' , has three basic tenetsâ€”developmental selection , experiential selection and reentry edelman argues that this dynamic selective process is directly analogous to the processes of selection that act on populations of individuals in species , and he also points out that this functional plasticity is imperative , since not even the vast coding capability of entire human genome is sufficient to explicitly specify the astronomically complex synaptic structures of the developing brain he defines reentry as the ongoing recursive dynamic interchange of signals that occurs in parallel between brain maps , and which continuously interrelates these maps to each other in time and space ( film clip : edelman demonstrates spontaneous group formation among neurons with re-entrant connections gerald edelman : '' from brain dynamics to consciousness : a prelude to the future of brain-based devices '' , video , ibm lecture on cognitive computing , june 2006 ) neural darwinism : the theory of neuronal group selection ( basic books , new york 1987 ) press 2004 ) second nature : brain science and human knowledge ( yale university press 2006 ) gerald edelman is a genius on a spiritual path '' - profile in san diego jewish journal , october 2007 '' from brain dynamics to consciousness '' , video , ibm lecture on cognitive computing , june 2006 , inactive as of jeffrey epstein vi foundation june 15 , 2013
