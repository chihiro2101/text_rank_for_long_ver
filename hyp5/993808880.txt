mach 's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle 's state of motion has no meaning in that case the writing in which einstein found inspiration from mach was '' the science of mechanics '' , where the philosopher criticized newton 's idea of absolute space , in particular the argument that newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system : what is commonly called '' newton 's bucket argument '' in mach 's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion , uniform or accelerated , has sense only in reference to other bodies ( i.e it is then not clear , in the passages from mach just mentioned , if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies most physicists believe mach 's principle was never developed into a quantitative physical theory that would explain a mechanism by which the stars can have such an effect because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply , what exactly is meant by '' mach 's principle '' in general relativity is even less clear than in newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of mach 's principle are possible , some being considered more strongly machian than others einstein , before completing his development of the general theory of relativity , found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of mach 's principle einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of mach 's principle that he wrote a letter to mach expressing this : the lenseâ€“thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that '' matter there influences inertia here '' as for the statement that '' inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies '' , this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect more fundamental to the problem , however , is the very existence of a fixed background , which einstein describes as '' the fixed stars '' in such universes mach 's principle can be stated as the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum ( and possibly other information ) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe ( where '' a particular moment in the universe '' refers to a chosen cauchy surface ) however , einstein was convinced that a valid theory of gravity would necessarily have to include the relativity of inertia :
