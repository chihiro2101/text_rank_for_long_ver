this allows for the transmission of a large amount of signal energy without interfering with conventional narrowband and carrier wave transmission in the same frequency band regulatory limits in many countries allow for this efficient use of radio bandwidth , and enable high-data-rate personal area network ( pan ) wireless connectivity , longer-range low-data-rate applications , and radar and imaging systems , transparently with existing communications systems a significant difference between conventional radio transmissions and uwb is that conventional systems transmit information by varying the power level , frequency , and/or phase of a sinusoidal wave uwb transmissions transmit information by generating radio energy at specific time intervals and occupying a large bandwidth , thus enabling pulse-position or time modulation a uwb radio system can be used to determine the '' time of flight '' of the transmission at various frequencies due to its high resolution despite using lower frequencies , uwb sar was heavily researched for its object-penetration ability arl has also investigated the feasibility of whether uwb radar technology can incorporate doppler processing to estimate the velocity of a moving target when the platform is stationary while a 2013 report highlighted the issue with the use of uwb waveforms due to target range migration during the integration interval , more recent studies have suggested that uwb waveforms can demonstrate better performance compared to conventional doppler processing as long as a correct matched filter is used it serves as a potential alternative to continuous-wave radar since it involves less power consumption and a high-resolution range profile uwb radar has been proposed as the active sensor component in an automatic target recognition application , designed to detect humans or objects that have fallen onto subway tracks uwb was proposed for use in personal area networks , and appeared in the ieee 802.15.3a draft pan standard slow progress in uwb standards development , the cost of initial implementation , and performance significantly lower than initially expected are several reasons for the limited use of uwb in consumer products ( which caused several uwb vendors to cease operations in 2008 and 2009 ) the fcc ruling also deÔ¨Ånes access to a 7.5 & nbsp ; ghz of unlicensed spectrum between 3.1 and 10.6 & nbsp ; ghz that is made available for communication and measurement systems
