in taking on the task of compiling the samguk sagi ( '' compiling '' is more accurate than '' writing '' because much of the history is taken from earlier historical records ) , kim busik was consciously modeling his actions on china imperial traditions , just as he modeled the history ’ s format after its chinese forebears specifically , he was harking back to the work of sima qian , an official of the former han dynasty ( 206 bce-24 ce ) nowadays known as the records of the grand historian , this work was released circa 100 bce under the more modest title of shǐjì 史記 , i.e adopted as well from chinese historiographical tradition was the classic four-part division of the standard dynastic history into annals ( bongi , 本紀 ) , tables ( pyo , 表 ) , monographs ( ji , 志 ) , and biographies ( yeoljeon , 列傳 ) the ideological factors are made manifest in the work 's preface , written by kim busik , where the historian states , : of today ’ s scholars and high-ranking officials , there are those who are well-versed and can discuss in detail the five classics and the other philosophical treatises in chinese tradition , the compilation of a dynastic history also served political ends in this context , it should be remembered that the compilation of the samguk sagi was an officially sponsored undertaking , commissioned by the goryeo king , with the members of its compilation staff approved by the central bureaucracy however , the fact that '' native heritage '' is primarily interpreted by the samguk sagi to mean '' three kingdoms heritage '' brings us to the work ’ s ostensibly broader purpose , and that was to promote three kingdoms ( in contrast to the competing neighbors like buyeo , mahan , and gaya , which were absorbed into the three kingdoms ) as the orthodox ruling kingdoms of korea , and to thus solidify the legitimacy and prestige of the goryeo state , as the three kingdoms ’ rightful successor it was with just such intent that goryeo 's king injong tapped kim busik to compile the history of the three kingdoms goryeo ’ s quest , through the writing of the samguk sagi , to secure its legitimacy and establish its continuation of the '' mantle of authority '' ( or mandate of heaven ) from the three kingdoms , meant as a necessary consequence that the compilers of the samguk sagi , unlike those of the jewang ungi or the goryeo dogyeong ( 高麗圖經 ) , emphasized united silla , the last survivor among the three kingdoms , and ignored balhae king munmu - part one : book 07 king munmu - part two : book 08 king sindae , gogukcheon , sansang : book 17 king yeongyang , yeongnyu : book 21 king bojang - part one : book 22 geography of goguryeo and new names assigned by king gyeongdeok : book 36 geography of baekje and new names assigned by king gyeongdeok : book 37 the samguk sagi was written on the basis of the gu samguksa ( 舊三國史 , old history of the three kingdoms ) , and other earlier historical records such as the hwarang segi ( 花郞世記 , annals of hwarang ) , most of which are no longer extant concerning external sources , no references are made to the japanese chronicles , like the kojiki 古事記 , '' records of ancient matters '' or the nihon shoki 日本書紀 , chronicles of japan that were respectively released in 712 and 720 in contrast , he lifts generously from the chinese dynastic chronicles and even unofficial chinese records , most prominently the wei shu ( 魏書 , book of wei ) , sanguo zhi ( 三國志 ) , jin shu ( 晉書 ) , jiu tangshu ( 舊唐書 , old history of tang ) , xin tangshu ( 新唐書 , new history of tang ) , and the zizhi tongjian ( 資治通鑑 , comprehensive mirror for aid in government ) according to mcbride , part of the theses of sin chaeho were that : : the real hero of the three kingdoms period was the koguryo general ulchi mundék , who , in 612 , lured the huge invasion force of sui emperor yang-ti into a trap at salsu ( cheongcheon ) river , engineering a spectacular victory ( but only deserves a page in book 44 ) ’ ( book 42 ) and about possible sadaejuui towards the goryeo powerful people and class complicity , one can note ( with kim kichung ) that many biographies are two sided in their conclusions in any case , it is clear that kim busik 's samguk sagi is critical to the study of korean history during the three kingdoms and unified silla periods -- -- -- -- -- - > translation of the whole silla bongi translation of the whole goguryeo bongi translation of the whole baekje bongji isolated translations gardiner , kenneth h.j translation of book one of the goguryeo bongi '' kim busik 's samguk sagi : the 12th century man viewpoint on korean culture ''
