the purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component normally , on modern systems , the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem , such as the main processor or graphics controller , but other components , such as system memory ( ram ) or system buses ( generally on the motherboard ) , are commonly involved most components are designed with a margin of safety to deal with operating conditions outside of a manufacturer 's control ; examples are ambient temperature and fluctuations in operating voltage overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin , with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user generally for any given voltage most parts will have a maximum '' stable '' speed where they still operate correctly while in a pc context the usual result is a system crash , more subtle errors can go undetected , which over a long enough time can give unpleasant surprises such as data corruption ( incorrectly calculated results , or worse writing to storage incorrectly ) or the system failing only during certain specific tasks ( general usage such as internet browsing and word processing appear fine , but any application wanting advanced graphics crashes the system ) at some point there will be a limit imposed by the ability to supply the device with sufficient power , the user 's ability to cool the part , and the device 's own maximum voltage tolerance before it achieves destructive failure the speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system , and what components are being overclocked by the user ; benchmarks for different purposes are published reducing the cooling requirements needed to keep hardware at a given operational temperature has knock-on benefits such as lowering the number and speed of fans to allow quiet pc , and in mobile devices increase the length of battery life per charge some manufacturers underclock components of battery-powered equipment to improve battery life , or implement systems that detect when a device is operating under battery power and reduce clock frequency underclocking and undervolting would be attempted on a desktop system to have it operate silently ( such as for a home entertainment center ) while potentially offering higher performance than currently offered by low-voltage processor offerings this was also attractive as using a '' standard voltage '' processor in a '' low voltage '' application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified low voltage version the usefulness of underclocking ( again like overclocking ) is determined by what processor offerings , prices , and availability are at the specific time of the build another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing system requirements and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons most efforts for computer components however focus on specific components , such as , processors ( a.k.a some systems allow additional tuning of other clocks ( such as a clock rate ) that influence the bus clock speed that , again is multiplied by the processor to allow for finer adjustments of the final processor speed any given component will ultimately stop operating reliably past a certain clock speed components are only guaranteed to operate correctly up to their rated values ; beyond that different samples may have different overclocking potential first is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new clock rate as clock frequencies in digital circuits and voltage applied increase , the heat generated by components running at the higher performance levels also increases in addition , some digital circuits slow down at high temperatures due to changes in mosfet device characteristics thermoelectric cooling devices which actually refrigerate using the peltier effect can help with high thermal design power ( tdp ) processors made by intel and amd in the early twenty-first century this method of cooling is highly effective , but itself generates significant heat elsewhere which must be carried away , often by a convection-based heatsink or a water cooling system as an overclocked component operates outside of the manufacturer 's recommended operating conditions , it may function incorrectly , leading to system instability a large-scale 2011 field study of hardware faults causing a system crash for consumer pcs and laptops showed a four to 20 times increase ( depending on cpu manufacturer ) in system crashes due to cpu failure for overclocked computers over an eight-month period although software tools are available for testing hardware stability , it is generally impossible for any private individual to thoroughly test the functionality of a processor to further complicate matters , in process technologies such as silicon on insulator ( soi ) , devices display hysteresis & mdash ; a circuit 's performance is affected by the events of the past , so without carefully targeted tests it is possible for a particular sequence of state changes to work at overclocked rates in one situation but not another even if the voltage and temperature are the same in many cases components are manufactured by the same process , and tested after manufacture to determine their actual maximum ratings for example , some benchmarks test only one aspect of the system , such as memory bandwidth , without taking into consideration how higher clock rates in this aspect will improve the system performance as a whole apart from demanding applications such as video encoding , high-demand databases and scientific computing , memory bandwidth is typically not a bottleneck , so a great increase in memory bandwidth may be unnoticeable to a user depending on the applications used several video card manufactures now offer factory-overclocked versions of their graphics accelerators , complete with a warranty , usually at a price intermediate between that of the standard product and a non-overclocked product of higher performance more recently however , notably with intel 's skylake architecture , intel had a bug with the skylake ( 6th gen core ) processors where the base clock could be increased past 102.7 mhz , however functionality of certain features would not work intel intended to block base clock ( bclk ) overclocking of locked processors when designing the skylake architecture to prevent consumers from purchasing cheaper components and overclocking to previously-unseen heights ( since the cpu 's bclk was no longer tied to the pci buses ) , however for lga1151 , the 6th generation '' skylake '' processors were able to be overclocked past 102.7 mhz ( which was the intended limit by intel , and was later mandated through later bios updates ) higher performance in games , en-/decoding , video editing and system tasks at no additional direct monetary expense , but with increased electrical consumption and thermal output system optimization : some systems have '' bottlenecks '' , where small overclocking of one component can help realize the full potential of another component to a greater percentage than when just the limiting hardware itself is overclocked manipulating elements of how the processor clock rate is set ( usually adjusting the multiplier ) , it is often possible to overclock the processor a small amount , around 5-10 % , and gain a small increase in ram clock rate and/or reduction in ram latency timings if disk access or the speed of an internet connection limit the speed of a process , a 20 % increase in processor speed is unlikely to be noticed , however there are some scenarios where increasing the clock speed of a processor actually allows an ssd to be read and written to faster it is common to run into one of those problems when overclocking graphics cards ; both symptoms at the same time usually means that the card is severely pushed beyond its heat , clock rate , and/or voltage limits , however if seen when not overclocked , they indicate a faulty card excessive voltage increases may damage or destroy components on the graphics card or the entire graphics card itself ( practically speaking ) flashing refers to using the firmware of a different card with the same ( or sometimes similar ) core and compatible firmware , effectively making it a higher model card ; it can be difficult , and may be irreversible therefore , it could be wise to set this middle-stage prior to '' serious '' overclocking , specifically because of this fallback ability ; the card can drop down to this clock rate , reducing by a few ( or sometimes a few dozen , depending on the setting ) percent of its efficiency and cool down , without dropping out of 3d mode ( and afterwards return to the desired high performance clock and voltage settings ) while these models have either 8 or 12 pipes enabled , they share the same 16x6 gpu core as a 6800gt or ultra , but pipelines and shaders beyond those specified are disabled ; the gpu may be fully functional , or may have been found to have faults which do not affect operation at the lower specification
