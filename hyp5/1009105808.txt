the board of education on january 9 , 1942 , adopted a resolution containing recitals taken largely from the court 's gobitis opinion and ordering that the salute to the flag become '' a regular part of the program of activities in the public schools '' , that all teachers and pupils '' shall be required to participate in the salute honoring the nation represented by the flag ; provided , however , that refusal to salute the flag be regarded as an act of insubordination , and shall be dealt with accordingly '' what was required after the modification was a roman salute , the saluter to keep the right hand raised with palm turned up while the following is repeated : '' i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands ; one nation , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all jackson center and the supreme court historical society , at the jackson center in jamestown , new york : moderator : what was your parents ' decision about how to handle this situation : the school has a mandatory flag salute , thanks to the state education department regulation , and you have your religious belief ? gathie barnette edmonds : when we went home , of course , they understood and they said not to worry about it the barnetts brought suit in the united states district court for themselves and others similarly situated asking its injunction to restrain enforcement of these laws and regulations against jehovah 's witnesses , and prevailed , with the three-judge panel stating : the school district subsequently appealed roosevelt 's subsequent appointment of wiley rutledge , had created a shift on views of the first amendmentâ€”for instance , the court overturned a precedent set a mere nine months prior in jones v the court held , in a 6-to-3 decision delivered by justice jackson , that it was unconstitutional for public schools to compel students to salute the flag '' then jackson dealt with frankfurter 's assertion that forcing students to salute the flag , and threatening them with expulsion if they chose not to , was a permissible way to foster national unity jackson responded that the conflict , in this case , was between authority and the individual and that the founders intended the bill of rights to put some rights out of reach from majorities , ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities jackson wrote : the last leg of frankfurter 's gobitis opinion reasoned that matters like saluting the flag were issues of '' school discipline '' that are better left to local officials rather than federal judges justice jackson rejected this argument as well : love of country must spring from willing hearts and free minds , inspired by a fair administration of wise laws enacted by the people 's elected representatives within the bounds of express constitutional prohibitions '' frankfurter 's response to jackson 's systematic destruction of his gobitis decision was one of anger , and justices roberts and murphy tried to get him to revise his opinion , arguing that the first two lines were '' much too personal '' frankfurter , however , insisted that the passage was necessary since he claimed he was '' literally flooded with letters '' following the court 's decision in gobitis that said he should be more sensitive to the protection of minorities due to his jewish heritage '' having responded to his critics and the court 's reversal on a personal level , he now responded on a judicial one , with the remainder of his opinion focusing on judicial restraint '' as a member of this court , i am not justified in writing my private notions of policy into the constitution it can never be emphasized too much that one 's own opinion about the wisdom or evil of a law should be excluded altogether when one is doing one 's duty on the bench '' frankfurter continued , arguing that if the court is frequently striking down laws it is circumventing the democratic process since the court can not work to reach a compromise instead , frankfurter focused on his belief that there were no provisions within the constitution that occupied a '' preferred position '' over others the majority opinion in barnette is considered one of the court 's greatest and most sweeping statements about the fundamental freedoms established by the bill of rights verner ( 1963 ) , for example , the court upheld a seventh-day adventist 's claim to unemployment benefits even though she declined to make herself available to work on saturday ( her sabbath ) as the law required the principal came back and said your teacher obviously does n't remember the supreme court decision
