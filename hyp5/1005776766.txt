when thutmose iii reached a suitable age and demonstrated the capability , she appointed him to head her armies though in some circles the older dates 1504 & nbsp ; bc to 1450 & nbsp ; bc are preferred from the high chronology of egypt a papyrus from amenhotep i 's reign records this astronomical observation which theoretically could be used to perfectly correlate the egyptian chronology with the modern calendar ; however , to do this the latitude where the observation was taken must also be known the length of thutmose iii 's reign is known to the day thanks to information found in the tomb of the military commander amenemheb-mahu the day of thutmose iii 's accession is known to be i shemu day four , and astronomical observations can be used to establish the exact dates of the beginning and end of the king 's reign ( assuming the low chronology ) from 28 april 1479 & nbsp ; bc to 11 march 1425 & nbsp ; bc respectively widely considered a military genius by historians ,

v–vi of the preface to thutmose iii : a new biography , university of michigan press , 2006 whether the egyptian empire covered even more areas is even less certain much is known about thutmosis '' the warrior '' not only because of his military achievements , but also because of his royal scribe and army commander , thanuny , who wrote about his conquests and reign thutmose iii was able to conquer such a large number of lands because of the revolution and improvement in military weapons when hatshepsut died on the 10th day of the sixth month of thutmose iii 's 21st year , according to information from a single stela from armant , the king of kadesh advanced his army to megiddo the northern route and the southern route , both of which went around the mountain , were judged by his council of war to be the safest , but thutmose , in an act of great bravery ( or so he boasts , but such self-praise is normal in egyptian texts ) , accused the council of cowardice and took a dangerous route steindorff , george ; and seele , keith thutmose was forced to besiege the city , but he finally succeeded in conquering it after a siege of seven or eight months ( see battle of megiddo ( 15th century bc ) ) 193 oxford university press , 1964 the only noticeable absence is mitanni , which would bear the brunt of the following egyptian campaigns into western asia thutmose 's second , third and fourth campaigns appear to have been nothing more than tours of syria and canaan to collect tribute . this text records tribute from the area which the egyptians called retjenu ( roughly equivalent to canaan ) and it was also at this time that assyria paid a second '' tribute '' to thutmose iii it is probable that these texts come from thutmose 's 40th year or later and thus have nothing to do with the second campaign at all thutmose 's third campaign was not considered significant enough to appear in his otherwise extensive annals at karnak in thutmose 's 29th year , he began his fifth campaign , where he first took an unknown city ( the name falls in a lacuna ) which had been garrisoned by tunip unlike previous plundering raids , thutmose iii garrisoned the area known as djahy , which is probably a reference to southern syria although there is no direct evidence for it , it is for this reason that some have supposed that thutmose 's sixth campaign , in his thirtieth year , commenced with a naval transportation of troops directly to byblos , bypassing canaan entirely thutmose iii found that by taking family members of these key people to egypt as hostages , he could drastically increase their loyalty to him syria rebelled again in thutmose 's 31st year and he returned to syria for his seventh campaign , took the port city of ullaza and the smaller phoenician ports and took more measures to prevent further rebellions after thutmose iii had taken control of the syrian cities , the obvious target for his eighth campaign was the state of mitanni , a hurrian country with an indo-aryan ruling class thutmose iii then went freely from city to city and pillaged them while the nobles hid in caves , or at least this is the typically propagandistic way egyptian records chose to record it during this period of no opposition , thutmose put up a second stele commemorating his crossing of the euphrates next to the stele his grandfather , thutmose i , had put up several decades earlier thutmose iii then returned to syria by way of niy , where he records that he engaged in an elephant hunt thutmose iii returned to syria for his ninth campaign in his 34th year , but this appears to have been just a raid of the area called nuhašše , a region populated by semi-nomadic people by thutmose 's 35th year , the king of mitanni had raised a large army and engaged the egyptians around aleppo as usual for any egyptian king , thutmose boasted a total crushing victory , but this statement is suspect due to the very small amount of plunder taken . part of the tribute list for his 12th campaign remains immediately before his 13th begins , and the contents recorded , specifically wild game and certain minerals of uncertain identification , might indicate that it took place on the steppe around nukhashshe , but this remains mere speculation in his 40th year , tribute was collected from foreign powers , but it is unknown if this was considered a campaign ( i.e if the king went with it or if it was led by an official ) . only the tribute list remains from thutmose 's next campaign , and nothing may be deduced about it except that it was probably another raid to the frontiers around niy . his victory in this final campaign was neither complete nor permanent since he did not take kadesh , and tunip could not have remained aligned to him for very long , certainly not beyond his own death although no king of egypt had ever penetrated so far with an army , previous kings ' campaigns had spread egyptian culture that far already , and the earliest egyptian document found at gebel barkal dates from three years before thutmose 's campaign thutmose iii was a great builder and constructed over 50 temples , although some of these are now lost and only mentioned in written records he also commissioned the building of many tombs for nobles , which were made with greater craftsmanship than ever before his reign was also a period of great stylistic changes in the sculpture , paintings and reliefs associated with construction , much of it beginning during the reign of hatshepsut thutmose 's architects and artisans showed great continuity with the formal style of previous kings , but several developments set him apart from his predecessors although he followed the traditional relief styles for most of his reign , after his 42nd year he began having himself depicted wearing the red crown of lower egypt and a šndyt-kilt , an unprecedented style he built egypt 's only known set of heraldic pillars , two large columns standing alone instead of being part of a set supporting the roof his jubilee hall was also revolutionary and is arguably the earliest known building created in the basilica style although not directly pertaining to his monuments , it appears that thutmose 's artisans had learned glass making skills , developed in the early 18th dynasty , to create drinking vessels by the core-formed method it was not , however , erected until thutmose iv raised it 35 years later a complete version of amduat , an important new kingdom funerary text , is in the vestibule , making it the first tomb where egyptologists found the complete text on the two pillars in the middle of the chamber there are passages from the litanies of re , a text that celebrates the later sun deity , who is identified with the pharaoh at this time although thutmose iii was a co-regent during this time , early historians have speculated that thutmose iii never forgave his stepmother for denying him access to the throne for the first two decades of his reign however , in recent times this theory has been revised after questions arose as to why hatshepsut would have allowed a resentful heir to control armies , which it is known she did this view is supported further by the fact that no strong evidence has been found to show thutmose iii sought to claim the throne added to this is the fact that the monuments of hatshepsut were not damaged until at least 25 years after her death , late in the reign of thutmose iii when he was quite elderly he was in another coregency , this one with his son , who would become amenhotep ii , who is known to have attempted to identify the works of hatshepsut as his own however , recent research by scholars such as charles nims and peter dorman has re-examined these erasures and found that the acts of erasure which could be dated only began some time during year 46 or 47 of thutmose 's reign ( c currently , the purposeful destruction of the memory of hatshepsut is seen as a measure designed to ensure a smooth succession for the son of thutmose iii , the future amenhotep ii , as opposed to any of the surviving relatives of hatshepsut who had an equal or better claim to the throne it also may be likely that this measure could not have been taken until the deaths of powerful religious and administrative officials who had served under both hatshepsut and thutmose iii later , amenhotep ii even claimed that he had built the items he defaced according to the american egyptologist peter der manuelian , a statement in the tomb biography of an official named amenemheb establishes that thutmose iii died in year 54 , iii peret day 30 of his reign after ruling egypt for '' 53 years , 10 months and 26 days '' ( urk ancient records of
