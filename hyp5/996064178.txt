some researchers argue that youth 's values and morals are not distinct from those of their parents , which means that youth culture is not a separate culture just because people see the presence of what seems to be a youth culture today does not mean that this phenomenon extends to all generations of young people additionally , peer influence varies greatly between contexts and by sex , age , and social status , making a single '' youth culture '' difficult , if not impossible , to define others argue that there are definite elements of youth society that constitute culture , and that these elements differ from those of their parents ' culture tested the following hypothesis : '' if youth culture serves to help adolescents deal with problems of vulnerability and finiteness , then reminders of mortality should lead to increased allegiance to cultural practice and belief of the youth schwartz and merten used the language of adolescents to argue for the presence of youth culture as distinct from the rest of society according to schwartz , this reflects a difference in social structures and the way that adults and teens experience social reality this difference indicates cultural differences between adolescents and adults , which supports the presence of a separate youth culture the need for universalistic norms has made it impractical for young people 's socialization to come primarily from immediate family members , which would lead to significant variation in the norms that are communicated youth culture may be a means of achieving identity during a time when one 's role in life is not always clear as a means of coping with these contrasting aspects of adolescence , youth create independence through behavior—specifically , through the leisure-oriented activities that are done with peers researchers have characterized youth culture as embodying values that are '' in conflict with those of the adult world '' age and sex in the social structure of the united states these perceptions have led many adults to believe that adolescents hold different values than older generations and to perceive youth culture as an attack on the morals of current society these worries have prompted the creation of parenting websites such as theyouthculturereport.com and the center for parent youth understanding ( cpyu.org ) , whose goal is to preserve the values of older generations in young people despite the attitudes of many adults , there is not a consensus among researchers about whether youth subcultures hold different beliefs than adults do perhaps the increased prevalence of age segregation contributed to the problems of modern youth , and these problems represent a difference in values however , most evidence suggests that these youth problems are not a reflection of different morals held by younger generations multiple studies have found that most adolescents hold views that are similar to their parents one study challenged the theory that adolescent cohorts have distanced themselves from their parents by finding that between 1976 and 1982 , a time when rates of adolescent problems increased , adolescents became less peer-oriented another study did find differences between adolescents ' and parents ' attitudes , but found that the differences were in the degree of belief , not in the attitude itself there may also be pluralistic ignorance on the part of youth regarding how their attitudes compare to peers and parents one reason may be that the similarities between adolescent and adult values are relatively invisible compared to the differences between these two groups adults may also falsely believe that youth 's assertion of independence in exterior aspects of their life represents a manifestation of a different value system in reality , sports , language , music , clothing and dating tend to be superficial ways of expressing autonomy—they can be adopted without compromising one 's beliefs or values as drinking and having sex may be common in adolescence , many researchers include them as aspects of youth culture research demonstrates that many factors may influence youth to engage in high-risk behaviors , including '' a lack of stable role models , heightened family stresses , lowered levels of family investment , weakened emotional bonds between parents and their children , lowered levels of social capital and social control , and a lack of hope in ones future '' however , teen culture may also have benefits for the adolescent organizations of young people , which were often based on a student identity , were crucial to the civil rights movement according to this theory , an especially large population of young people , especially males , is associated with social unrest , war , and terrorism the rationale that heinsohn gives is that these population trends leave many people unable to find prestigious places in society , so they turn their attention to creating change in society
