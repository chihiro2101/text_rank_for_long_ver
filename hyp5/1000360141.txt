subsequently , it became valued for its ability to improve pedestrian safety and reduce noise and air pollution from traffic for much of the 20th century , streets were designed by engineers who were charged only with ensuring smooth motor vehicular traffic flow and not with fostering the other functions of streets because neighborhood traffic management studies have shown that residents often contribute to the perceived speeding problem within their neighborhoods , instructions on traffic calming ( for example in hass-klau et al engineering measures involve physically altering the road layout or appearance to actively or passively retard traffic by one of several means : increasing the cognitive load of driving ( making driving more difficult ) increasing the chance that an obstruction in the road will slow or momentarily stop motorists ( such as replacing a bus pullout with a bus bulb , causing transit vehicles to stop for passenger loading and unloading in the travel lane , rather than pulling off and letting cars pass ) increasing the chance of passenger discomfort or even physical damage to a vehicle if speed limits are not observed ( such as speed humps ) ( accessed 27 january 2007 ) a number of visual changes to roads are being made to encourage more attentive driving , reduced speed , reduced crashes , and a greater tendency to yield to pedestrians visual traffic calming includes lane narrowings ( 9-10 ' ) , road diets ( reduction in lanes ) , use of trees next to streets , on-street parking , and buildings placed in urban fashion close to streets traffic calming can include the following engineering measures , grouped by similarity of method : narrowing : narrowing traffic lanes makes slower speeds seem more natural to drivers and are less intrusive than other treatments that limit speed or restrict route choice for example , allowing parking on one or both sides of a street to reduce the number of driving lanes speed cushions , two or three small speed humps sitting in a line across the road that slow cars down but allows wider emergency vehicles to straddle them so as not to slow emergency response time such traffic calming means include : median diverters to prevent left turns or through movements into a residential area enforcement and education measures for traffic calming include : reducing speed limits near institutions such as schools and hospitals ( see below ) vehicle activated sign , signs which react with a message if they detect a vehicle exceeding a pre-determined speed attempts to improve speed limit observance are usually by either education , enforcement or road engineering how to enhance walking and cycling instead of shorter car trips and to make these modes safer , deliverable d6 walcyng contract no : ur-96-sc.099 , department of traffic planning and engineering , university of lund , sweden 1999 the netherlands has an estimated 1,500 speed/red-light camera installations and has set a target for 30 & nbsp ; km/h limits on 70 % of urban roads for example , a living street ( sometimes known as home zones or by the dutch word woonerf , as the concept originated in the netherlands ) towards the end of the 1960s , initially in delft , is a street in which the needs of car drivers are secondary to the needs of other road users ; traffic calming principles are integrated into their design more recently , in response to growing numbers of traffic accidents and speeding problems , cities across north america have begun creating traffic calming programs to improve safety and liveability on residential streets moreover , bulb-outs were added on each corner of the intersection to slow traffic while protecting pedestrians by reducing the amount of roadway they must cross in conjunction with the additional bike lanes , the plan includes protected intersections for cyclists along harrison street to omit the need for dangerous mixing zones tokyo 's narrow streets force automobiles and pedestrians to be close to one another ; a common traffic calming technique in tokyo is to change the surface material and/or texture of the shoulder of narrow roads , which helps define the boundary between cars and pedestrians , while allowing cars to use those spaces to pass oncoming traffic he claims that some traffic calming measures such as reverting one way roads into two-way roads or creating '' bump outs '' have increased motor traffic congestion , resulted in more accidents and increased pedestrian fatalities
