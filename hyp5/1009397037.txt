rayon is produced by dissolving cellulose followed by the conversion of this solution back to insoluble fibrous cellulose max fremery and johann urban developed a method to produce carbon fibers for use in light bulbs in 1897 cuprammonium rayon has properties similar to viscose ; however , during its production , the cellulose is combined with copper and ammonia ( schweizer 's reagent ) due to the detrimental environmental effects of this production method , cuprammonium rayon is no longer produced in the united states they named their material '' viscose '' because its production involved the intermediacy of a highly viscous solution the process built on the reaction of cellulose with a strong base , followed by treatment of that solution with carbon disulfide to give a xanthate derivative the xanthate is then converted back to a cellulose fiber in a subsequent step courtaulds formed an american division , american viscose ( later known as avtex fibers ) , to produce their formulation in the united states in 1910 the name '' rayon '' was adopted in 1924 , with '' viscose '' being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane the viscose method can use wood as a source of cellulose , whereas other routes to rayon require lignin-free cellulose as a starting material the use of woody sources of cellulose makes viscose cheaper , so it was traditionally used on a larger scale than the other methods on the other hand , the original viscose process generates large amounts of contaminated wastewater rayon was produced only as a filament fiber until the 1930s when methods were developed to utilize '' broken waste rayon '' as staple fiber industrial applications of rayon emerged around 1935 substituting cotton fiber in tires and belts , industrial types of rayon developed a totally different set of properties , amongst which tensile strength and elastic modulus were paramount modal is a type of rayon but made from particularly high-quality cellulose the fabric has been known to pill less than cotton due to fiber properties and lower surface friction this type of rayon is typically used for industrial purposes such as tire cord '' lyocell '' has become a genericized trademark , used to refer to the lyocell process for making cellulose fibers cellulose acetate shares many similarities with viscose rayon , and was formerly considered as the same textile rayon is a versatile fiber and is widely claimed to have the same comfort properties as natural fibers , although the drape and slipperiness of rayon textiles are often more like nylon the durability and appearance retention of regular viscose rayons are low , especially when wet ; also , rayon has the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber the raw material for viscose is primarily wood pulp , which is chemically converted into a soluble compound unless the chemicals are handled carefully , workers can be seriously harmed by the carbon disulfide used to manufacture most rayon production begins with processed cellulose obtained from wood pulp and plant fibers so to delay the process of regeneration , zinc sulfate is used in the bath which converts cellulose xanthate to zinc cellulose xanthate thus providing time for proper orientation to take place before regeneration the spinning of viscose rayon fiber is done using a wet-spinning process trade names are used within the rayon industry to label the type of rayon in the product tencel , generic name lyocell , is made by a slightly different solvent recovery process , and is considered a different fiber by the us ftc the process , which dissolves cellulose without a chemical reaction , was developed by courtaulds research much attention has been paid to the toxicity of carbon disulfide use in the viscose process however , the volatile carbon disulfide is lost before the rayon gets to the consumer ; the rayon itself is basically pure cellulose silverfish like the firebrat can eat rayon , but damage was found to be minor , potentially due to the heavy , slick texture of the tested rayon a 2014 ocean survey found that rayon contributed to 56.9 % of the total fibers found in deep sea areas , the rest being polyester , polyamides , acetate and acrylic products made from viscose
