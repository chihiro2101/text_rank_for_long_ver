therefore , the purpose of exposure adjustment ( and/or lighting adjustment ) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film , so that 'significant ' areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film 's useful exposure range in a scene with strong or harsh lighting , the ratio between highlight and shadow luminance values may well be larger than the ratio between the film 's maximum and minimum useful exposure values in this case , adjusting the camera 's exposure settings ( which only applies changes to the whole image , not selectively to parts of the image ) only allows the photographer to choose between underexposed shadows or overexposed highlights ; it can not bring both into the useful exposure range at the same time methods for dealing with this situation include : using what is called fill lighting to increase the illumination in shadow areas ; using a graduated neutral-density filter , flag , scrim , or gobo to reduce the illumination falling upon areas deemed too bright ; or varying the exposure between multiple , otherwise identical , photographs ( exposure bracketing ) and then combining them afterwards in an hdri process as the adjacent image shows , these terms are technical ones rather than artistic judgments ; an overexposed or underexposed image may be '' correct '' in the sense that it provides the effect that the photographer intended many photographers choose to control aperture and shutter independently because opening up the aperture increases exposure , but also decreases the depth of field , and a slower shutter increases exposure but also increases the opportunity for motion blur cameras with any kind of internal exposure meter usually feature an exposure compensation setting which is intended to allow the photographer to simply offset the exposure level from the internal meter 's estimate of appropriate exposure if one exposes the film or sensor for a longer period , a reciprocally smaller aperture is required to reduce the amount of light hitting the film to obtain the same exposure the true characteristic of most photographic emulsions is not actually linear ( see sensitometry ) , but it is close enough over the exposure range of about 1 second to 1/1000 of a second the zone system is another method of determining exposure and development combinations to achieve a greater tonality range over conventional methods by varying the contrast of the film to fit the print contrast capability digital cameras can achieve similar results ( high dynamic range ) by combining several different exposures ( varying shutter or diaphragm ) made in quick succession today , most cameras automatically determine the correct exposure at the time of taking a photograph by using a built-in light meter , or multiple point meters interpreted by a built-in computer , see metering mode in digital images this information loss is often irreversible , though small problems can be made less noticeable using graphics program digital capture tends to be more tolerant of underexposure , allowing better recovery of shadow detail , than same-iso negative print film bulb ( photography ) exposure bracketing exposure value film speed gray card high dynamic range imaging light painting light value long exposure multiple flash photographic technique multiple exposure night photography sensitometry ( and hurterâ€“driffield curves ) shutter speed ( also called exposure time ) zebra patterning
