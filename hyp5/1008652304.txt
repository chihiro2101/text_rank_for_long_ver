by 10 october 1808 , napoleon had 244,125 soldiers massed in eight army corps , the cavalry reserve , the imperial guard , and other formations for the purpose of conquering spain 104-105 on 11 december 1808 , general john moore led a british army numbering 22,500 foot soldiers , 2,500 horsemen , and 66 artillery pieces northeast from salamanca '' soon after , moore learned that napoleon had seized madrid and that over 200,000 imperial french troops were in the field nevertheless , the british general decided to strike at marshal nicolas soult 's isolated ii corps in the north of spain meanwhile , napoleon found out what was going on and ordered 80,000 troops to march north to annihilate the british getting news of the avalanche coming his way , moore led his army toward corunna in northwest spain with napoleon and his main field army away chasing moore , the imperial troops holding madrid were too weak to mount any offensives not counted was king joseph 's royal guard consisting of four battalions and one cavalry regiment of frenchmen plus two small regiments of spanish deserters one , a lieutenant had refused to march and positioned his artillery battery to fire on the troops who were obeying orders many low-strength line regiments were consolidated from three battalions into one or two when the dragoons charged the spanish force that had gotten behind the town , the infantry were forced to form squares because the spanish cavalry was late into action , the two dragoon regiments got away without further damage leaving only lasalle 's cavalry and two battalions on the tagus , he marched northeast to ávila , ignoring repeated instructions from king joseph to desist arriving at ávila on 5 january , lefebvre 's corps was completely removed from the defensive lines around madrid but , instead of pressing his advantage , the spanish commander became inert between 26 december and 11 january to support the army of the center , a 6,000-man spanish division under general marquis del palacio moved north from the sierra morena to villaharta on 8 january , the division of dessolles arrived in madrid followed in two days by the return of the iv corps from ávila these heavy reinforcements allowed napoleon 's defensive scheme around madrid to be reestablished instead , infantado sent three or four battalions of reinforcements and advised his lieutenant that he was on the way note that the list includes men present under arms and is from a 1 february 1809 state , which was two weeks after the battle three infantry battalions and four cavalry regiments formed an advance guard to watch the approach of the french from tribaldos village four battalions defended the town of uclés in the center with remaining cavalry and the four guns in front eight battalions held the right flank , while six battalions deployed on the left flank villatte quickly drove the advance guard out of tribaldos ; it fell back to the main spanish position however , the french attack proceeded swiftly and crumpled up the spanish left flank before the reinforcements could give any help when victor saw the success of his right wing , he ordered villatte 's left wing brigade under general of brigade michel-marie pacthod to attack the spanish right flank since many of the defending units had been sent to the left , pacthod 's assault easily reached the top of the ridge the cavalry seems to have fought hardly at all leaving only two or three battalions under general pedro agustín girón to act as the rear guard meanwhile , ruffin 's division lost its way and made a wider march than intended though ruffin was late to the field , he and his troops fortuitously arrived squarely in the spanish rear the nimble spanish cavalry largely escaped along with some left flank infantry , while girón 's men broke out between two french regiments meanwhile , infantado with his remaining 9,000 soldiers set out from cuenca on 12 january continuing their advance on the 13th , infantado 's men came across the remnants of venegas ' force and got word of the disaster gathering up his wagon train and supplies , infantado abandoned his base and led his troops to chinchilla de monte-aragón where he arrived on 20 january 13-14 after occupying cuenca , victor determined that the army of the center was out of reach
