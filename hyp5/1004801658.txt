'' did dinosaurs break the sound barrier ? '' the new york times , december 2 , 1997 this problem was one that led to early research into jet engines , notably by frank whittle in england and hans von ohain in germany , who were led to their research specifically in order to avoid these problems in high-speed flight nevertheless , propeller aircraft were able to approach the critical mach number in a dive all of these effects , although unrelated in most ways , led to the concept of a '' barrier '' making it difficult for an aircraft to exceed the speed of sound during wwii and immediately thereafter , a number of claims were made that the sound barrier had been broken in a dive the typical airspeed indicator ( asi ) uses air pressure differences between two or more points on the aircraft , typically near the nose and at the side of the fuselage , to produce a speed figure in similar tests , the north american p-51 mustang demonstrated limits at mach 0.85 , with every flight over m0.84 causing the aircraft to be damaged by vibration in a subsequent flight , squadron leader anthony martindale achieved mach 0.92 , but it ended in a forced landing after over-revving damaged the engine further , a series of tests made by karl doetsch at the behest of willy messerschmitt found that the plane became uncontrollable above mach 0.86 , and at mach 0.9 would nose over into a dive that could not be recovered from post-war tests by the raf confirmed these results , with the slight modification that the maximum speed using new instruments was found to be mach 0.84 , rather than mach 0.86 in 1999 , mutke enlisted the help of professor otto wagner of the munich technical university to run computational tests to determine whether the aircraft could break the sound barrier however , it is not clear where these terms came from , as it does not appear the us pilots carried out such tests in his 1990 book me-163 , former messerschmitt me 163 pilot mano ziegler claims that his friend , test pilot heini dittmar , broke the sound barrier while diving the rocket plane , and that several people on the ground heard the sonic booms dittmar himself does not make a claim that he broke the sound barrier on that flight and notes that the speed was recorded only on the ais he does , however , take credit for being the first pilot to '' knock on the sound barrier '' the luftwaffe test pilot lothar sieber ( 7 april 1922 – 1 march 1945 ) may have inadvertently become the first man to break the sound barrier on 1 march 1945 in contrast , the german v-2 ballistic missile routinely broke the sound barrier in flight , for the first time on 3 october 1942 in 1942 , the united kingdom 's ministry of aviation began a top-secret project with miles aircraft to develop the world 's first aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier image : m52 model.jpg thumb left one of the vickers models undergoing supersonic wind-tunnel testing at the royal aircraft establishment ( rae ) around 1946 another critical addition was the use of a power-operated stabilator , also known as the all-moving tail or flying tail , a key to supersonic flight control , which contrasted with traditional hinged tailplanes ( horizontal stabilizers ) connected mechanically to the pilots control column the miles m.52 was the first instance of this solution , which has since been universally applied initially , the aircraft was to use frank whittle 's latest engine , the power jets w.2/700 , which would only reach supersonic speed in a shallow dive finally , the design included another critical element the use of a inlet cone in the nose to slow the incoming air to the subsonic speeds needed by the engine although the project was eventually cancelled , the research was used to construct an unmanned missile that went on to achieve a speed of mach 1.38 in a successful , controlled transonic and supersonic level test flight ; this was a unique achievement at that time , which validated the aerodynamics of the m.52 the first '' official '' aircraft to break the sound barrier bell 's supersonic design was still using a conventional tail , and they were battling the problem of control it was in the x-1 that chuck yeager was credited with being the first person to break the sound barrier in level flight on 14 october 1947 , flying at an altitude of 45,000 & nbsp ; ft ( 13.7 & nbsp ; km ) george welch made a plausible but officially unverified claim to have broken the sound barrier on 1 october 1947 , while flying an xp-86 sabre he also claimed to have repeated his supersonic flight on 14 october 1947 , 30 minutes before yeager broke the sound barrier in the bell x-1 xs-1 flight number 50 is the first one where the x-1 recorded supersonic flight , at mach 1.06 ( 361 & nbsp ; m/s , 1,299 & nbsp ; km/h , 807.2 & nbsp ; mph ) peak speed ; however , yeager and many other personnel believe that flight 49 ( also with yeager piloting ) , which reached a top recorded speed of mach 0.997 ( 339 & nbsp ; m/s , 1,221 & nbsp ; km/h ) , may have , in fact , exceeded mach 1 as the science of high-speed flight became more widely understood , a number of changes led to the eventual understanding that the '' sound barrier '' is easily penetrated , with the right conditions among these changes were the introduction of thin swept wings , the area rule , and engines of ever-increasing performance by the 1950s , many combat aircraft could routinely break the sound barrier in level flight , although they often suffered from control problems when doing so , such as mach tuck by the late 1950s , the issue was so well understood that many companies started investing in the development of supersonic airliners , or ssts , believing that to be the next '' natural '' step in airliner evolution although the concorde and the tupolev tu-144 entered service in the 1970s , both were later retired without being replaced by similar designs although concorde and the tu-144 were the first aircraft to carry commercial passengers at supersonic speeds , they were not the first or only commercial airliners to break the sound barrier the purpose of the flight was to collect data on a new design of leading edge for the wing on 12 january 1948 , a northrop unmanned rocket sled became the first land vehicle to break the sound barrier on 15 october 1997 , in a vehicle designed and built by a team led by richard noble , royal air force pilot andy green became the first person to break the sound barrier in a land vehicle in compliance with fédération internationale de l'automobile rules the vehicle , called the thrustssc ( '' super sonic car '' ) , captured the record 50 years and one day after yeager 's first supersonic flight the project would see baumgartner attempt to jump 120,000 & nbsp ; ft ( 36,580 & nbsp ; m ) from a helium balloon and become the first parachutist to break the sound barrier test pilot chuck yeager 's successful attempt to break the sound barrier in an aircraft the quest for mach one : a first-person account of breaking the sound barrier
