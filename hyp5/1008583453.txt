five general stages are used to describe the process of decomposition in vertebrate animals : fresh , bloat , active decay , advanced decay , and dry/remains since blood is no longer being pumped through the body , gravity causes it to drain to the dependent portions of the body , creating an overall bluish-purple discolouration termed livor mortis or , more commonly , lividity the resulting decrease in ph and other chemical changes causes cells to lose their structural integrity , bringing about the release of cellular enzymes capable of initiating the breakdown of surrounding cells and tissues visible changes caused by decomposition are limited during the fresh stage , although autolysis may cause blisters to appear at the surface of the skin the small amount of oxygen remaining in the body is quickly depleted by cellular metabolism and aerobic organism naturally present in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts , creating an ideal environment for the proliferation of anaerobic organisms the associated gases which accumulate within the body at this time aid in the transport of sulfhemoglobin throughout the body via the circulatory and lymphatic systems , giving the body an overall marbled appearance maggot feeding , and the accumulation of gases within the body , eventually leads to post-mortem skin ruptures which will then further allow purging of gases and fluids into the surrounding environment decomposition is largely inhibited during advanced decay due to the loss of readily available cadaveric material during the dry/remains stage , the resurgence of plant growth around the cdi may occur and is a sign that the nutrients present in the surrounding soil have not yet returned to their normal levels a dead body that has been exposed to the open elements , such as water and air , will decompose more quickly and attract much more insect activity than a body that is buried or confined in special protective gear or artifacts this is due , in part , to the limited number of insects that can penetrate a coffin and the lower temperatures under the soil the rate and manner of decomposition in an animal body are strongly affected by several factors in roughly descending degrees of importance , they are : temperature ; the availability of oxygen ; prior embalming ; cause of death ; burial , depth of burial , and soil type ; access by scavengers ; trauma , including wounds and crushing blows ; humidity , or wetness ; rainfall ; body size and weight ; composition ; clothing ; the surface on which the body rests ; foods/objects inside the specimen 's digestive tract ( bacon compared to lettuce ) ultimately , the rate of bacterial decomposition acting on the tissue will depend upon the temperature of the surroundings under certain conditions ( normally cool , damp soil ) , bodies may undergo saponification and develop a waxy substance called adipocere , caused by the action of soil chemicals on the body 's proteins and fats in extremely dry or cold conditions , the normal process of decomposition is halted & nbsp ; – by either lack of moisture or temperature controls on bacterial and enzymatic action & nbsp ; – causing the body to be preserved as a mummy the bodies of newborns who never ingested food are an important exception to the normal process of decomposition they lack the internal microbial flora that produces much of decomposition and quite commonly mummifies if kept in even moderately dry conditions this could be a place where the body is buried in organic material and oxygen can not reach it the chemicals used in embalming repel most insects and slow down bacterial putrefaction by either killing existing bacteria in or on the body themselves or by '' fixing '' cellular proteins , which means that they can not act as a nutrient source for subsequent bacterial infections even when a body is decomposed , embalming treatment can still be achieved ( the arterial system decays more slowly ) but would not restore a natural appearance without extensive reconstruction and cosmetic work , and is largely used to control the foul odors due to decomposition scientists at the body farm study how the human body decays in various circumstances to gain a better understanding of decomposition another early process is physical breakup or fragmentation of the plant material into smaller bits which have greater surface area for microbial colonization and attack because of this nutritional enrichment the fauna of xylophagy insects may develop and in turn affect dead wood , contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor lignin is one such remaining product of decomposing plants with a very complex chemical structure causing the rate of microbial breakdown to slow warmth increases the speed of plant decay , by the same amount regardless of the composition of the plant in most grassland ecosystems , natural damage from fire , insects that feed on decaying matter , termites , grazing mammals , and the physical movement of animals through the grass are the primary agents of breakdown and nutrient cycling , while bacteria and fungi play the main roles in further decomposition when the proper conditions are lacking the bacteria may form spores which lurk until suitable conditions arise to continue reproduction the rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors—the physical environment ( temperature , moisture and soil properties ) , the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers , and the nature of the microbial community itself under these conditions , many bacterial cells burst , releasing a pulse of nutrients soil disturbance like tillage increases decomposition by increasing the amount of oxygen in the soil and by exposing new organic matter to soil microbes microbial cell walls also contain recalcitrant materials like chitin , and these also accumulate as the microbes die , further reducing the quality of older soil organic matter .
