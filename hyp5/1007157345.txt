in europe , the term is '' medicinal product '' , and it is defined by eu law as : '' any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings ; or '' '' any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring , correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological , immunological or metabolic action , or to making a medical diagnosis one of the key classifications is between traditional small molecule drugs ; usually derived from chemical synthesis , and biologic medical products ; which include recombinant proteins , vaccines , blood products used therapeutically ( such as ivig ) , gene therapy , and cell therapy ( for instance , stem cell therapies ) pharmaceuticals or drugs or medicines are classified in various other groups besides their origin on the basis of pharmacological properties like mode of action and their pharmacological action or activity , database of prescription pharmaceutical products including drug classifications such as by chemical property , mode or route of administration , biological system affected , or therapeutic effects a sampling of classes of medicine includes : antipyretics : reducing fever ( pyrexia/pyresis ) analgesics : reducing pain ( painkillers ) antimalarial drugs : treating malaria antibiotics : inhibiting germ growth antiseptics : prevention of germ growth near burns , cuts and wounds mood stabilizers : lithium and valpromide hormone replacements : premarin oral contraceptives : enovid , '' biphasic '' pill , and '' triphasic '' pill stimulants : methylphenidate , amphetamine tranquilizers : meprobamate , chlorpromazine , reserpine , chlordiazepoxide , diazepam , and alprazolam statins : lovastatin , pravastatin , and simvastatin pharmaceuticals may also be described as '' specialty '' , independent of other classifications , which is an ill-defined class of drugs that might be difficult to administer , require special handling during administration , require patient monitoring during and immediately after administration , have particular regulatory requirements restricting their use , and are generally expensive relative to other drugs oral administration , the most common form of enteral administration , can be performed in various dosage forms including pills , tablets , or capsules , and other routes likewise have various forms the drug may contain a single or multiple active ingredients historically , drugs were discovered through identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by serendipity discovery since sequencing of the human genome which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins , it has become common practice to use high throughput screening of large compounds libraries against isolated biological targets which are hypothesized to be disease-modifying in a process known as reverse pharmacology even more recently , scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level , and to use that knowledge to design ( see drug design ) drug candidates modern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits , medicinal chemistry and optimization of those hits to increase the affinity , selectivity ( to reduce the potential of side effects ) , efficacy/potency , metabolic stability ( to increase the half-life ) , and oral bioavailability one or more of these steps may , but not necessarily , involve computer-aided drug design despite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems , drug discovery is still a lengthy , '' expensive , difficult , and inefficient process '' with low rate of new therapeutic discovery drug discovery is done by pharmaceutical companies , sometimes with research assistance from universities drug development is the process of bringing a new drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery it includes pre-clinical research ( microorganisms/animals ) and clinical trials ( on humans ) and may include the step of obtaining regulatory approval to market the drug depending upon the jurisdiction , drugs may be divided into over-the-counter drugs ( otc ) which may be available without special restrictions , and prescription drugs , which must be prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner in accordance with medical guidelines due to the risk of adverse effects and contraindications doctors may also prescribe prescription drugs for off-label use – purposes which the drugs were not originally approved for by the regulatory agency : : '' in the pharmaceutical industry , a blockbuster drug is one that achieves acceptance by prescribing physicians as a therapeutic standard for , most commonly , a highly prevalent chronic ( rather than acute ) condition patients often take the medicines for long periods penicillin , introduced a few years later , provided a broader spectrum of activity compared to sulfa drugs and reduced side effects streptomycin , found in 1942 , proved to be the first drug effective against the cause of tuberculosis and also came to be the best known of a long series of important antibiotics hrt has been prescribed to improve one 's quality of life enovid was known to be much more effective than alternatives including the condom and the diaphragm as early as 1960 , oral contraceptives were available in several different strengths by every manufacturer in the 1980s and 1990s , an increasing number of options arose including , most recently , a new drug delivery for the oral contraceptive via a transdermal patch only fourteen months after it was made available , meprobamate had become the country 's largest-selling prescription drug using plants and plant substances to treat all kinds of diseases and medical conditions is believed to date back to prehistoric medicine medieval medicine saw advances in surgery , but few truly effective drugs existed , beyond opium ( found in such extremely popular drugs as the '' great rest '' of the antidotarium nicolai at the time ) and quinine the second world war saw the introduction of widespread and effective antimicrobial therapy with the development and mass production of penicillin antibiotics , made possible by the pressures of the war and the collaboration of british scientists with the american pharmaceutical industry as of 2007 , thousands of approved drugs have been developed recently , multi-disciplinary approaches have yielded a wealth of new data on the development of novel antibiotics and antibacterials and on the use of biological agents for antibacterial therapy in the 1950s , new psychiatric drugs , notably the antipsychotic chlorpromazine , were designed in laboratories and slowly came into preferred use patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control governments have been heavily involved in the regulation of drug development and drug sales , the elixir sulfanilamide disaster led to the establishment of the food and drug administration , and the 1938 federal food , drug , and cosmetic act required manufacturers to file new drugs with the fda until the 1970s , drug prices were not a major concern for doctors and patients as more drugs became prescribed for chronic illnesses , however , costs became burdensome , and by the 1970s nearly every u.s state required or encouraged the substitution of generic drugs for higher-priced brand names controversies concerning pharmaceutical drugs include patient access to drugs under development and not yet approved , pricing , and environmental issues governments worldwide have created provisions for granting access to drugs prior to approval for patients who have exhausted all alternative treatment options and do not match clinical trial entry criteria often grouped under the labels of compassionate use , expanded access , or named patient supply , these programs are governed by rules which vary by country defining access criteria , data collection , promotion , and control of drug distribution outside the us , named patient programs provide controlled , pre-approval access to drugs in response to requests by physicians on behalf of specific , or '' named '' , patients before those medicines are licensed in the patient 's home country through these programs , patients are able to access drugs in late-stage clinical trials or approved in other countries for a genuine , unmet medical need , before those drugs have been licensed in the patient 's home country patients who have not been able to get access to drugs in development have organized and advocated for greater access in 2013 , biomarin pharmaceutical was at the center of a high-profile debate regarding expanded access of cancer patients to experimental drugs essential medicines as defined by the world health organization ( who ) are '' those drugs that satisfy the health care needs of the majority of the population ; they should therefore be available at all times in adequate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms , at a price the community can afford '' recent studies have found that most of the medicines on the who essential medicines list , outside of the field of hiv drugs , are not patented in the developing world , and that lack of widespread access to medicines arise from issues fundamental to economic development – lack of infrastructure and poverty some have raised ethical objections specifically with respect to pharmaceutical patents and the high prices for drugs that they enable their proprietors to charge , which poor people in the developed world , and developing world , can not afford one study concluded that marketing expenditures for new drugs often doubled the amount that was allocated for research and development ppcps are substances used by individuals for personal health or cosmetic reasons and
