most commonly anthers are two-lobed and are attached to the filament either at the base or in the middle area of the anther the stamens in a flower are collectively called the androecium the androecium in various species of plants forms a great variety of patterns , some of them highly complex depending on the species of plant , some or all of the stamens in a flower may be attached to the petals or to the floral axis they also may be free-standing or fused to one another in many different ways , including fusion of some but not all stamens pages 553–555 extreme cases of stamen fusion occur in some species of cyclanthera in the family cucurbitaceae and in section cyclanthera of genus phyllanthus ( family euphorbiaceae ) where the stamens form a ring around the gynoecium , with a single locule a typical anther contains four microsporangia each microsporangium is lined with a nutritive tissue layer called the tapetum and initially contains diploid pollen mother cells each microspore then divides mitotically to form an immature gametophyte called a pollen the pollen is eventually released when the anther forms openings ( dehisces ) ( monoecious both types of flowers found on the same plant ; dioecious the two types of flower found only on different plants ) ; stamen stamens can also be adnate ( fused or joined from more than one whorl ) : epipetalous : adnate to the corolla epiphyllous : adnate to undifferentiated tepals ( as in many liliaceae ) they can have different lengths from each other : didymous : two equal pairs didynamous : occurring in two pairs , a long pair and a shorter pair tetradynamous : occurring as a set of six stamens with four long and two shorter ones or respective to the rest of the flower ( perianth ) : exserted : extending beyond the corolla included : not extending beyond the corolla they may be arranged in one of two different patterns : spiral ; or whorled : one or more discrete whorls ( series ) they may be arranged , with respect to the petals : diplostemonous : in two whorls , the outer alternating with the petals , while the inner is opposite the petals haplostemenous : having a single series of stamens , equal in number to the proper number of petals and alternating with them obdiplostemonous : in two whorls , with twice the number of stamens as petals , the outer opposite the petals , inner opposite the sepals , e.g simaroubaceae ( see diagram ) ; connective where the connective is very small , or imperceptible , the anther lobes are close together , and the connective is referred to as discrete , e.g the connective may also bear appendages , and is called appendiculate , e.g ; filament a column formed from the fusion of multiple filaments is known as an androphore cambridge university press , 1996 monadelphous : fused into a single , compound structure declinate : curving downwards , then up at the tip ( also – declinate-descending ) diadelphous : joined partially into two androecial structures pentadelphous : joined partially into five androecial structures synandrous : only the anthers are connate ( such as in the asteraceae ) the anther can be attached to the filament 's connective in two ways : basifixed : attached at its base to the filament pseudobasifixed : a somewhat misnomer configuration where connective tissue extends in a tube around the filament tip dorsifixed : attached at its center to the filament , usually versatile ( able to move )
