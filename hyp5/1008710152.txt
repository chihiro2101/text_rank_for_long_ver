however , around the last four years of his life , tolkien encountered a problem when he realized that he had stated that ros , which was meant to reference his red hair , translated into '' spray/spindrift '' he later made a note suggesting that he might change maedhros 's name to maedron instead the dragon-helm of dor-lómin was given to maedhros by azaghâl during the first age , in gratitude for saving the life of the dwarf-lord , with whom maedhros forged an alliance although it was maglor who , in the silmarillion , took pity on the sons of elwing , earlier versions portrayed maedhros as the one who saved elrond ( elros not appearing until later drafts ) in aman , he was of the noldorin line for kingship—hence his father-name , '' nelyafinwë '' , which was quenya for '' finwë the third in succession '' —but unlike his royal kin , maedhros had auburn hair inherited from his maternal grandfather , mahtan , to whom maedhros was said to be alike in face and disposition during his travels maedhros befriended fingon , son of fingolfin , though their respective fathers would enter into a bitter feud this daring rescue , along with maedhros ' repentance for the desertion of fingolfin 's hosts in araman and relinquishment of his claim as finwë 's heir to kingship over all the noldor in favour of his uncle ( which last caused the fëanorians to be known as “ the dispossessed ” ) , did much to repair the ill feelings between the house of fingolfin and the house of fëanor his brothers , however , are not all pleased by their eldest brother 's actions , and maedhros , sensing that they will cause feuds with their kinsmen , moves them out of mithrim and to the lands around the hill of himring , which become known as the march of maedhros taking hope upon hearing the deeds of beren and lúthien , he gathered his brothers , and united with other elven houses to create the union of maedhros , an alliance of elves , men , and dwarves to drive the orcs from beleriand and lay siege to morgoth 's fortress of angband upon learning that celegorm 's servants had left dior 's twin sons , eluréd and elurín , to starve in a dark forest , maedhros went on a long search for them , but it proved to be fruitless but the unfulfilment of the oath came to torment the brothers heavily , so they sent messages of friendship but with firm demands to surrender the silmaril however , the people refused , arguing that they could not negotiate while their leader and elwing 's husband , eärendil , was away at sea after the war of wrath , maedhros and maglor , the last of the sons of fëanor , told eönwë that the remaining two silmarils captured from morgoth should be given to them , but eönwë replied that the silmarils would not suffer them to hold them and that the brothers had to face judgement from the valar in aman unable to endure the suffering , maedhros killed himself , throwing himself and his silmaril into a fiery chasm of the earth , while maglor casts his silmaril into the sea and never returns to his folk , wandering along the coast and lamenting his loss and pain instead '' no other player has there been , / no other lips or fingers seen / so skilled , 't is said in elven-lore , / save maelor son of fëanor , / forgotten harper , singer doomed , / who young when laurelin yet bloomed / to endless lamentation passed /and in the tombless sea was cast
