aerospace-related lifting body research arose from the idea of spacecraft re-entering the earth 's atmosphere and landing much like a regular aircraft image : x24.jpg thumb 250px right the martin aircraft company x-24 built as part of a 1963 to 1975 experimental us military program nasa 's refinements of the lifting body concept began in 1962 with r the first full-size model to come out of reed 's program was the nasa m2-f1 , an unpowered craft made of wood since the m2-f1 was a glider , a small rocket motor was added in order to extend the landing envelope in 1963 , nasa began programs with heavier rocket-powered lifting-body vehicles to be air launched from under the starboard wing of a nb-52b , a derivative of the b-52 jet bomber lifting bodies were eventually rejected in favor of a delta wing design for the space shuttle the shuttle 's delta wing design was driven by these issues although a lifting body configuration would not have been vulnerable to the wing leading edge failure that caused the second shuttle loss , such a configuration could not meet the flight envelope requirements of both nasa and the military nonetheless , the lifting body concept has been implemented in a number of other aerospace programs , the previously mentioned nasa x-38 , lockheed martin x-33 , bac 's multi unit space transport and recovery device , europe 's eads phoenix , and the joint russian-european kliper spacecraft another use of a lifting body is spacex 's falcon 9 rocket 's first stage according to spacex , the grid fins can tilt the first stage to approximately twenty degrees to generate lift and steer the stage towards a floating landing platform or ground landing pad the dream chaser design is planned to carry up to seven people to and from low-earth orbit the initial design was to have carried a crew of 4 , but it could carry up to 6 , or a combination of crew and cargo '' failing to be selected for a ccdev phase 2 award by nasa , orbital announced in april 2011 that they would likely wind down their efforts to develop a commercial crew vehicle list of armstrong flight research center lifting body vehicles ( 1963 to 1975 ) the us government developed a variety of proof-of-concept and flight-test vehicle lifting body designs from the early 1960s through the mid-1970s at armstrong flight research center his series ufo featured a lifting body craft visually similar to the m2-f2 for orbital operations ( '' the man who came back '' ) lifting bodies fact sheet ( nasa ) nasa tech paper 3101 : numerical analysis and simulation of an assured crew return vehicle flow field ( the math of airflow over a lifting body ) nasa photo collections from dryden flight research center hl-10 m2-f1 m2-f2 m2-f3 x-24a and x24b short m2-f1 history some history of lifting body flight wingless flight : the lifting body story
