a tunnel is relatively long and narrow ; the length is often much greater than twice the diameter , although similar shorter excavations can be constructed , such as cross passages between tunnels where it is important to stress that it is passing underneath , it may be called an underpass , though the official term when passing under a railway is an underbridge a longer underpass containing a road , canal or railway is normally called a '' tunnel '' , whether or not it passes under another item of infrastructure an underpass of any length under a river is also usually called a '' tunnel '' , whatever mode of transport it is for in the us , the term '' subway '' means an underground rapid transit system , and the term pedestrian underpass is used for a passage beneath a barrier in planning the route , the horizontal and vertical alignments can be selected to make use of the best ground and water conditions it is common practice to locate a tunnel deeper than otherwise would be required , in order to excavate through solid rock or other material that is easier to support during construction to give more information , a pilot tunnel ( or '' drift tunnel '' ) may be driven ahead of the main excavation this smaller tunnel is less likely to collapse catastrophically should unexpected conditions be met , and it can be incorporated into the final tunnel or used as a backup or emergency escape passage groundwater control is very important in tunnel construction for water crossings , a tunnel is generally more costly to construct than a bridge however , navigational considerations may limit the use of high bridges or drawbridge spans intersecting with shipping channels , necessitating a tunnel bridges usually require a larger footprint on each shore than tunnels boston 's big dig project replaced elevated roadways with a tunnel system to increase traffic capacity , hide traffic , reclaim land , redecorate , and reunite the city with the waterfront the 1934 queensway tunnel under the river mersey at liverpool was chosen over a massively high bridge for defense reasons ; it was feared that aircraft could destroy a bridge in times of war maintenance costs of a massive bridge to allow the world 's largest ships to navigate under were considered higher than for a tunnel other reasons for choosing a tunnel instead of a bridge include avoiding difficulties with tides , weather , and shipping during construction ( as in the channel tunnel ) , aesthetic reasons ( preserving the above-ground view , landscape , and scenery ) , and also for weight capacity reasons ( it may be more feasible to build a tunnel than a sufficiently strong bridge ) the method of tunnel construction depends on such factors as the ground conditions , the groundwater conditions , the length and diameter of the tunnel drive , the depth of the tunnel , the logistics of supporting the tunnel excavation , the final use and the shape of the tunnel and appropriate risk management there are three basic types of tunnel construction in common use cut-and-cover is a simple method of construction for shallow tunnels where a trench is excavated and roofed over with an overhead support system strong enough to carry the load of what is to be built above the tunnel two basic forms of cut-and-cover tunneling are available : bottom-up method : a trench is excavated , with ground support as necessary , and the tunnel is constructed in it this , and the availability of electric traction , brought about london underground 's switch to bored tunnels at a deeper level towards the end of the 19th century in certain predominantly urban applications , tunnel boring is viewed as a quick and cost-effective alternative to laying surface rails and roads disadvantages of tbms arise from their usually large size â€“ the difficulty of transporting the large tbm to the site of tunnel construction , or ( alternatively ) the high cost of assembling the tbm on-site , often within the confines of the tunnel being constructed clay-kicking is a specialized method developed in the united kingdom of digging tunnels in strong clay-based soil structures used in victorian civil engineering , the method found favor in the renewal of britain 's ancient sewerage systems , by not having to remove all property or infrastructure to create a small tunnel system a temporary access shaft is sometimes necessary during the excavation of a tunnel they are usually circular and go straight down until they reach the level at which the tunnel is going to be built if a tunnel is going to be long , multiple shafts at various locations may be bored so that entrance to the tunnel is closer to the unexcavated area once construction is complete , construction access shafts are often used as ventilation shafts , and may also be used as emergency exits the main idea of this method is to use the geological stress of the surrounding rock mass to stabilize the tunnel , by allowing a measured relaxation and stress reassignment into the surrounding rock to prevent full loads becoming imposed on the supports submerged floating tunnels are a novel approach under consideration ; however , no such tunnels have been constructed to date during construction of a tunnel it is often convenient to install a temporary railway , particularly to remove spoil tip , often narrow gauge so that it can be double track to allow the operation of empty and loaded trains at the same time the vehicles or traffic using a tunnel can outgrow it , requiring replacement or enlargement : the original single line gib tunnel near mittagong was replaced with a double-track tunnel , with the original tunnel used for growing mushrooms the thirlmere aqueduct in north west england , united kingdom is sometimes considered the longest tunnel , of any type , in the world at , though the aqueduct 's tunnel section is not continuous the dahuofang water tunnel in china , opened in 2009 , is the third longest water tunnel in the world at length following a 1992 flood the network was sealed , although some parts still carry utility and communications infrastructure the tunnel is long and at above sea level is the highest active railroad tunnel in the us ( the tennessee pass line , currently inactive , and alpine tunnel are higher ) gerrards cross tunnel , in england , opened in 2010 , is notable in that it converted an existing railway cutting into a tunnel to create ground to build a supermarket over the tunnel the railway in the cutting was first opened around 1906 , stretching over 104 years to complete a railway tunnel the tunnel was built using the cover method with craned in prefabricated forms in order to keep the busy railway operating during construction , a portion of the tunnel collapsed when soil cover was added the fenghuoshan tunnel , completed in 2005 on the qinghai-tibet railway is the world 's highest railway tunnel , about above sea level and long the tunnel and reservoir plan is a network of of drainage tunnels designed to reduce flooding in the chicago area although the underground railroad network used to transport escaped slaves was '' underground '' mostly in the sense of secrecy , hidden tunnels were occasionally used natural tunnel state park ( virginia , us ) features an natural tunnel , really a limestone cave , that has been used as a railroad tunnel since 1890
