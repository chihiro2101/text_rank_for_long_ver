the three roots become two cords when the middle and lower root join to form the lower cord , and these in turn unite to form the pudendal nerve proper just proximal to the sacrospinous ligament inside the pudendal canal , the nerve divides into branches , first giving off the inferior rectal nerve , then the perineal nerve , before continuing as the dorsal nerve of the penis ( in males ) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris ( in females ) for example , the pudendal nerve may actually originate in the sciatic nerve consequently , damage to the sciatic nerve can affect the pudendal nerve as well sometimes dorsal rami of the first sacral nerve contribute fibers to the pudendal nerve , and even more rarely ( clarification : unlike the internal sphincter muscle , the external sphincter is made of skeletal muscle , therefore it is under voluntary control of the somatic nervous system the pudendal nerve can be compressed or stretched , resulting in temporary or permanent neuropathy the time taken for a muscle supplied by the pudendal nerve to contract in response to an electrical stimulus applied to the sensory and motor fibers can be quantified file : gray829.png the male pelvis , showing the pudendal nerve ( centre right ) file : grant 1962 214.png schematic showing the structures innervated by the pudendal nerve file : grant 1962 215.png diagram of the course of the pudendal nerve in the male pelvis - '' inferior view of female perineum , branches of the internal pudendal artery
