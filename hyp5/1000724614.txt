while writing of afonso de albuquerque 's ventures in sumatra , joão de barros noted that the chinese were the first to control trade between sumatra and india , and noted the presence of chinese people living in sumatra barros also noted that while fernão pires was loading southeast asian spices onto his ship in pacem ( a kingdom in sumatra ) in order to sell or present them as gifts in china , two different kings were killed and their position usurped this mission was followed up later that year by rafael perestrello , who later traded with chinese merchants of canton in 1516 king manuel i authorized a trade mission in 1517 when andrade set sail with seven cannon-armed merchant vessels with a muslim interpreter on june 17 , 1517 andrade had been chosen for this mission in lisbon back in 1515 , so that—as a pharmacist—he could investigate the types of traditional chinese medicine for the benefit of the portuguese and europe florence merchant giovanni da empoli , who had written a report about trade with china while stationed in india , was also chosen for the mission as the chief commercial agent between the portuguese and chinese tomé pires , a royal apothecary who had also traveled to india and written a landmark work in 1515 on asian trade , was chosen as the chief ambassador for the mission chinese officials became even more cautious in dealing with the portuguese , since the deposed king of malacca had been a loyal tributary to the imperial ming court the chinese became suspicious once again of andrade , this time for being a spy , when he sent a ship along the fujian coast to look for further trade prospects , but he left a good impression when he gave the order that any locals who might be harmed by a portuguese should seek him for redress simão immediately made a bad impression upon the chinese when he built a fort at the center of tuen mun , an island designated for all foreigners to trade when a chinese official visited the island and began reasserting ming authority over it , simão became aggressive and hit him , knocking the official 's hat off however , there were no official reports of simão 's abuses , even though he stayed until september 1520 ; yet rumors of his behavior ( which became associated with all portuguese ) no doubt reached as far as the court of beijing , which would soon condemn the portuguese for this and other reasons although no chinese sources detail the event , portuguese sources tell of how the portuguese were summoned on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously prostrate themselves before a wall of the forbidden city to seek another audience with the emperor the portuguese also knew of two officials in the censorate—qiu daolong and he ao— who sent memorials to the throne that condemned the portuguese conquest of malacca and that their embassy should be rejected there were also reports sent to beijing by canton officials stating that the portuguese were bothersome foreigners who sought to build their own trading post although ming officials were of the opinion that only foreign tributary states listed during the beginning of the dynasty should be accepted at court , it was the eunuchs who wanted to expand commercial ties with new foreign countries earlier , in april and may 1521 , five portuguese ships docked at tuen mun to begin trading , but were ordered to leave once officials came to the region to announce the emperor 's death the portuguese refused this demand , so the chinese sent a naval squadron to drive them out , sinking one ship , killing many , and taking the rest as prisoners ( first battle of tamao ) in august 1522 , martim afonso de melo coutinho arrived at tuen mun with three ships , unaware of the conflict and expecting to meet with chinese officials on establishing consent for a portuguese trade base in china two survivors of this embassy were still alive around 1536 , when they sent letters to malacca and goa detailing plans for how the portuguese could capture canton by force other survivors of these missions retired to nearby lampaco ( lampa ) in guangdong , where a trade post would exist for several decades ; in 1537 , there were written records of the portuguese having three warehouses at lampa , shangchuan island , and macau , and were initially allowed there with the excuse of drying their goods in a storm despite initial hostilities , good relations between the portuguese and chinese would resume in 1549 with annual portuguese trade missions to shangchuan island , following an event where the portuguese helped ming authorities eliminate coastal pirates in 1554 , leonel de sousa—a later governor of macau— established positive relations through luso-chinese agreement ( 1554 ) denis crispin twitchett , john king fairbank , the cambridge history of china , volume 2 ; volume 8 , cambridge university press , 1978 , and in 1557 the ming court finally gave consent for a permanent and official portuguese trade base at macau although fernão pires de andrade and his portuguese comrades were the first to open up china to the west , another significant diplomatic mission reaching all the way to beijing would not be carried out until an italian , the jesuit matteo ricci ( 1552 & ndash ; 1610 ) ventured there in 1598
