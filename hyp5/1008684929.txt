homer , iliad , 18.376 it is more often used to describe non-electronic moving machines , especially those that have been made to resemble human or animal actions , such as the jacks on old public striking clocks , or the cuckoo and any other animated figures on a cuckoo clock there are many examples of automata in greek mythology : hephaestus created automata for his workshop ; him she found sweating with toil as he moved to and fro about his bellows in eager haste ; for he was fashioning tripods , twenty in all , to stand around the wall of his well-builded hall , and golden wheels had he set beneath the base of each that of themselves they might enter the gathering of the gods at his wish and again return to his house , a wonder to behold numerous water-powered automata were built by ktesibios , a greek inventor and the first head of the great library of alexandria , for example he '' used water to sound a whistle and make a model owl move this tradition continued in alexandria with inventors such as the greek mathematician hero of alexandria ( sometimes known as heron ) , whose writings on hydraulics , pneumatics , and mechanics described siphons , a fire engine , a water organ , the aeolipile , and a programmable cart complex mechanical devices are known to have existed in hellenistic greece , though the only surviving example is the antikythera mechanism , the earliest known analog computer the clockwork is thought to have come originally from rhodes , where there was apparently a tradition of mechanical engineering ; the island was renowned for its automata ; to quote pindar 's seventh olympic ode : : the animated figures stand : adorning every public street : and seem to breathe in stone , or : move their marble feet according to jewish legend , solomon used his wisdom to design a throne with mechanical animals which hailed him as king when he ascended it ; upon sitting down an eagle would place a crown upon his head , and a dove would bring him a torah scroll the manufacturing tradition of automata continued in the greek world well into the middle ages many big and complex clocks with automated figures were built as public spectacles in european town centres one of the earliest of these large clocks was the strasbourg clock , built in the fourteenth century which takes up the entire side of a cathedral wall numerous clockwork automata were manufactured in the 16th century , principally by the goldsmiths of the free imperial city of central europe a functional replica was later built that could move its arms , twist its head , and sit up in what is the first documented description of how a mechanical cuckoo works , a mechanical organ with several automated figures is described france in the 17th century was the birthplace of those ingenious mechanical toys that were to become prototypes for the engines of the industrial revolution thus , in 1649 , when louis xiv was still a child , an artisan named camus designed for him a miniature coach , and horses complete with footmen , page and a lady within the coach ; all these figures exhibited a perfect movement maillardet , a swiss mechanic , created an automaton capable of drawing four pictures and writing three poems michel foucault , discipline and punish , new york , vintage books , 1979 , p.136 : '' the classical age discovered the body as object and target of power the celebrated automata of the 18th century were not only a way of illustrating an organism , they were also political puppets , small-scale models of power : frederick , the meticulous king of small machines , well-trained regiments and long exercises , was obsessed with them the famous magician jean-eugène robert-houdin ( 1805–1871 ) was known for creating automata for his stage shows since 1990 dutch artist theo jansen has been building large automated pvc structures called strandbeest ( beach animal ) that can walk on wind power or compressed air unlike other modern automata , aree is an automaton instead of a robot for practical reasons — venus 's harsh conditions , particularly its surface temperature of , make operating electronics there for any significant time impossible
