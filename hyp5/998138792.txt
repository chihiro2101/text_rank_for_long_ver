they therefore began to supply modes which combined confidentiality and data integrity into a single cryptographic primitive ( an encryption algorithm ) an initialization vector ( iv ) or starting variable ( sv ) is a block of bits that is used by several modes to randomize the encryption and hence to produce distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times , without the need for a slower re-keying process an initialization vector has different security requirements than a key , so the iv usually does not need to be secret for most block cipher modes it is important that an initialization vector is never reused under the same key , i.e many block cipher modes have stronger requirements , such as the iv must be random or pseudorandom some block ciphers have particular problems with certain initialization vectors , such as all zero iv generating no encryption ( for some keys ) in cbc mode , the iv must be unpredictable ( random or pseudorandom ) at encryption time ; in particular , the ( previously ) common practice of re-using the last ciphertext block of a message as the iv for the next message is insecure ( for example , this method was used by ssl 2.0 ) synthetic initialization vector ( siv ) synthesize an internal iv by running an pseudo-random function ( prf ) construction called s2v on the input ( additional data and plaintext ) , preventing any external data from directly controlling the iv aes-gcm-siv synthesize an internal iv by running polyval galois mode of authentication on input ( additional data and plaintext ) , followed by an aes operation cfb , ofb and ctr modes do not require any special measures to handle messages whose lengths are not multiples of the block size , since the modes work by xoring the plaintext with the output of the block cipher this characteristic of stream ciphers makes them suitable for applications that require the encrypted ciphertext data to be the same size as the original plaintext data , and for applications that transmit data in streaming form where it is inconvenient to add padding bytes a number of modes of operation have been designed to combine secrecy and authentication in a single cryptographic primitive some single-pass authenticated encryption algorithms , such as ocb mode , are encumbered by patents , while others were specifically designed and released in a way to avoid such encumberment in addition , some modes also allow for the authentication of unencrypted associated data , and these are called aead ( authenticated encryption with associated data ) schemes like all counter modes , this is essentially a stream cipher , and so it is essential that a different iv is used for each stream that is encrypted s2v is a keyed hash is based on cmac , and the input to the function is : additional authenticated data ( zero , one or many aad fields are supported ) plaintext authentication key ( k due to the use of two keys , the authentication key k and encryption key k , naming schemes for siv aead-variants may lead to some confusion ; for example aead_aes_siv_cmac_256 refers to aes-siv with two aes-128 keys and not aes-256 aes-gcm-siv is a mode of operation for the advanced encryption standard which provides similar performance to galois/counter mode as well as misuse resistance in the event of the reuse of a cryptographic nonce the inputs of the listed modes are summarized in the following table : ( source : sp800-38a table d.2 : summary of effect of bit errors on decryption ) it might be observed , for example , that a one-block error in the transmitted ciphertext would result in a one-block error in the reconstructed plaintext for ecb mode encryption , while in cbc mode such an error would affect two blocks if resistance to random error is desirable , error-correcting codes should be applied to the ciphertext before transmission disk encryption often uses special purpose modes specifically designed for the application many modes use an initialization vector ( iv ) which , depending on the mode , may have requirements such as being only used once ( a nonce ) or being unpredictable ahead of its publication , etc deterministic authenticated encryption modes such as the nist key wrap algorithm and the siv ( rfc 5297 ) aead mode do not require an iv as an input , and return the same ciphertext and authentication tag every time for a given plaintext and key
