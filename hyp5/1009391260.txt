it is made of three rectangular galleries rising to a central tower , each level higher than the last because the temple faces west , the features are all set back towards the east , leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side ; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides this area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims , most written in khmer but others in burmese and japanese the four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water beyond , the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace , again a later addition the tower above the central shrine rises to a height of above the ground ; unlike those of previous temple mountains , the central tower is raised above the surrounding four in 1934 , the conservator george trouvé excavated the pit beneath the central shrine : filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure , but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of gold leaf two metres above ground level integrated with the architecture of the building , and one of the causes for its fame is angkor wat 's extensive decoration , which predominantly takes the form of bas-relief friezes they incorporated larger devata images ( all full-body portraits measuring approximately – more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers in fact , the entire city of angkor used up far greater amounts of stone than all the egyptian pyramids combined , and occupied an area significantly greater than modern-day paris moreover , unlike the egyptian pyramids which use limestone quarried barely away all the time , the entire city of angkor was built with sandstone quarried ( or more ) away the skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier , as demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century , before the khmer came to power the war damage to angkor wat 's temples however has been very limited , compared to the rest of cambodia 's temple ruins , and it has also received the most attentive restoration between 1986 and 1992 , the archaeological survey of india carried out restoration work on the temple , as france did not recognise the cambodian government at the time criticisms have been raised about both the early french restoration attempts and particularly the later indian work , with concerns over damage done to the stone surface by the use of chemicals and cement in 1992 , following an appeal for help by norodom sihanouk , angkor wat was listed in unesco 's world heritage in danger ( later removed in 2004 ) and world heritage site together with an appeal by unesco to the international community to save angkor a number of countries such as france , japan and china are currently involved in various angkor wat conservation projects the organisation 's survey found that around 20 % of the devatas were in very poor condition , mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure , and prevention of further collapse : the west facade of the upper level , for example , has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002 , while a japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005 world monuments fund began conservation work on the churning of the sea of milk gallery in 2008 after several years of studies on its condition tourism has also provided some additional funds for maintenance—as of 2000 approximately 28 % of ticket revenues across the whole angkor site was spent on the temples—although most work is carried out by teams sponsored by foreign governments rather than by the cambodian authorities in 2001 , this incentive resulted in the concept of the '' angkor tourist city '' which would be developed with regard to traditional khmer architecture , contain leisure and tourist facilities , and provide luxurious hotels capable of accommodating large numbers of tourists it has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area , such as the development of a large highway , has had a direct effect on the underground water table , subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at angkor wat since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like angkor tourist city , the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture bbc : map reveals ancient urban sprawl august 2007 guide to the angkor monuments – pdf downloadable english translation of maurice glaize 's 1944 guide inventory of angkor wat devata ( sacred khmer women ) february 2010 laser technology reveals lost city around angkor wat june 2013 roland fletcher , director of the greater angkor project , lectures on '' lidar , water and the demise of greater angkor '' in november , 2013 voice of angkor , an angkor temples guide
