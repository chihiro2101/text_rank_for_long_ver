the sama veda , which is believed to have laid the foundation for indian classical music , consists of hymns from the rigveda , set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during vedic yajnas owing to persian and islamic influences in north india from the 12th century onwards , indian classical music began to diverge into two distinct styles — hindustani music and carnatic music the main emphasis in carnatic music is on vocal music ; most compositions are written to be sung , and even when played on instruments , they are meant to be performed in a singing style ( known as gāyaki ) like hindustani music , carnatic music rests on two main elements : , the modes or melodic formulæ , and , the rhythmic cycles while there are an infinite number of sounds falling within a scale ( or raga ) in carnatic music , the number that can be distinguished by auditory perception is twenty-two ( although over the years , several of them have converged ) unlike other music systems , every member of the solfege ( called a swara ) has three variants in one scale , or raga , there is usually only one variant of each note present a raga in carnatic music prescribes a set of rules for building a melody – very similar to the western concept of mode talas have cycles of a defined number of beats and rarely change within a song improvisation in raga is the soul of indian classical music – an essential aspect arnold2000 , p17 the main traditional forms of improvisation in carnatic music consist of the following : nettlrussells1998 , pp an alapana , sometimes also called ragam , is the exposition of a raga or tone – a slow improvisation with no rhythm , where the raga acts as the basis of embellishment the performer will explore the ragam and touch on its various nuances , singing in the lower octaves first , then gradually moving up to higher octaves , while giving a hint of the song to be performed niraval , usually performed by the more advanced performers , consists of singing one or two lines of text of a song repeatedly , but with a series of melodic improvised elaborations although niraval consists of extempore melodic variations , generally , the original patterns of duration are maintained ; randel2003 , p562 each word in the lines of text stay set within their original place ( idam ) in the tala cycle in contrast to hindustani music of the northern part of india , carnatic music is taught and learned through compositions , which encode many intricate musical details , also providing scope for free improvisation nearly every rendition of a carnatic music composition is different and unique as it embodies elements of the composer 's vision , as well as the musician 's interpretation a carnatic composition really has two elements , one being the musical element , the other being what is conveyed in the composition this poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes ; the musicians are expected to understand what was conveyed by the composer in various languages , and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition compositions more commonly associated with indian classical dance and bhakthi have also been increasingly used in the carnatic music repertoire though these forms consist of lyric-based verses , musicians improvise raga phrases in free rhythm , like an alapana , so both the sound value , and the meaning of the text , guide the musician through elaborate melodic improvisations forms such as the divya prabandha , thevaram and ugabhoga are often performed similarly , however , these forms can also have a set melody and rhythm like the devaranama , javali , padam , thillana and thiruppugazh forms known for their complex structure , varnams are a fundamental form in carnatic music varnams are practised as vocal exercises in multiple speeds by performers of carnatic music , to help develop voice culture , and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm in carnatic music concerts , varnams are often performed by musicians as the opening item – acting as a warm up for the musicians , gupta2006 , p68 and as a means of grabbing the attention of the audience carnatic songs ( kritis ) are varied in structure and style , but generally consist of three units : pallavi he also composed gitas ( simple songs ) for novice students notation is not a new concept in indian music unlike classical western music , carnatic music is notated almost exclusively in tonic sol-fa notation using either a roman or indic script to represent the solfa names indian music makes use of hundreds of ragas , many more than the musical mode in western music it becomes difficult to write carnatic music using the staff notation without the use of too many accidentals furthermore , the staff notation requires that the song be played in a certain key in the more precise forms of carnatic notation , there are symbols placed above the notes indicating how the notes should be played or sung ; however , informally this practice is not followed but , irrespective of what type of recital it is , what is featured are compositions which form the core of this genre of music the drone itself is an integral part of performances and furnishes stability – the equivalent of harmony in western music the accompaniments form an integral part of every composition presented , and they closely follow and augment the melodic phrases outlined by the lead singer unlike hindustani music concerts , where an accompanying tabla player can keep beats without following the musical phrases at times , in carnatic music , the accompanists have to follow the intricacies of the composition since there are percussion elements such as eduppu in several compositions a contemporary carnatic music concert ( called a kutcheri ) usually lasts about three hours , and comprises a number of varied compositions each composition is set with specific notes and beats , but performers improvise extensively improvisation occurs in the melody of the composition as well as in using the notes to expound the beauty of the raga performers then begin the main compositions with a section called alapana exploring the raga with the raga thus established , the song begins , usually with lyrics if multiple percussion instruments are employed , they engage in a rhythmic dialogue until the main performer picks up the melody once again following the main composition , the concert continues with shorter and lighter songs some of the types of songs performed towards the end of the concerts are tillanas and thukkadas – bits of popular kritis or compositions requested by the audience it used to be a traditional month-long carnatic music festival , but since then it has also diversified into dance and drama , as well as non-carnatic art forms
