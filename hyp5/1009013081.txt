it is a prolific scrub-type tree and is often one of the first species to regenerate on cleared land this species is often confused with the related species kānuka ( kunzea ericoides ) – the easiest way to tell the difference between the two species in the field is to feel their foliage – mānuka leaves are prickly , while kānuka leaves are soft in australia , and not temperate new zealand ) , because they possess fire-adaptive traits like serotiny and storage lignotubers new studies demonstrate a loss of lignotubers among populations of leptospermum scoparium located in relatively fire-free zones of new zealand 's south island , while australian and tasmanian populations retain their lignotubers along with stronger manifestations of serotiny chemotypical variations also exist between different populations within new zealand , leading some to suggest that l recently , however , new research suggests that plant-to-plant variation far outstrips the variation seen between geographically isolated manuka sites , at least with regard to nectar chemistry '' jelly bush '' is also used in australia to describe similar honey from leptospermum polygalifolium tea tree arose because captain cook used the leaves to make a infusion numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use , of which the following have gained the royal horticultural society 's award of garden merit : - ( nanum group ) 'kiwi ' 'nichollsii nanum ' 'red damask ' 'silver sheen ' many more cultivars are available in new zealand but often the plant performs better in cultivation overseas because of this , attempts have been made , with limited commercial success , to cross the showy new zealand cultivars with mould-resistant australian leptospermum species manuka , as it is called by most new zealanders , was used in pre-european times by maori , and still is
