in his journey , memnoch claims he is not evil , but merely working for god by ushering lost souls into heaven the novel follows up on claims made by david in the tale of the body thief that god and the devil are on better terms than most christians believe it also reinterprets bible stories to create a complete history of earth , heaven and hell that fit neatly with the history of vampires given in the queen of the damned according to memnoch , he does not know how he came to be and therefore created the universe and life in an attempt to better understand himself he has long defied god in asking why humans should suffer and not immediately be placed in heaven the universe as revealed to lestat by the devil follows the following cosmology : god is a powerful and immortal being worshiped by angels , his first creation , since before the existence of matter and time through evolution , creatures on the earth developed into the image of god and angels and a '' flame '' of life which allowed pain and death when , as part of this , he experiences sex , god bans memnoch from heaven ; memnoch spends the next three months imparting his vast knowledge of science to humanity , thus inadvertently founding civilization , during which time memnoch realizes that the characteristic that sets humans apart is their ability to love and feel passionate after thousands of years wandering sheol , memnoch discovers an especially powerful group of souls who have forgiven god for his indifference and absence and appreciate the grandness of all creation god is highly pleased with the new composition of heaven , but memnoch continues to accuse god of not showing concern for the other souls of sheol god believes that by appearing in human form , performing miracles , suffering and dying , he will create a religion that will allow more humans to attain the love of god by suffering and sacrifice god continuously argues that man is a creature of nature and ruled by its laws ; only through suffering and death can man evolve and eventually be worthy of heaven memnoch continuously argues that suffering and death has no value , and man needlessly suffers in life and in sheol while already worthy of god 's light yet deprived of knowing him unlike a regular human , when god died on the cross he knew that he would survive and thus could never have known the true suffering of man : the fear of death man does not know his immortal soul will survive for all eternity , and thus suffers from fear of the unknown god knew he would survive death and could not truly know what it was to be a human working in sheol , memnoch creates a form of hell , a place where people who have been bad in life , will be punished until their souls are able to forgive all ( themselves , each other , and god ) for the suffering and ignorance they endured in order to understand the joy of creation and the light of god enough to be ready for heaven
