indigenous inhabitants of numidia remained semi-nomadic , often identified as berbers , until masinissa , chief of the massaesyli tribe based near cirta , who supported rome during the second punic war ( 206 bc ) against the nearby punics of carthage , used the support of rome to establish a kingdom his alliance with rome began to fray in the mid-second century bc among roman fears of masinissa 's ambitions and of carthage 's resurgence on the part of cato the elder masinissa died before any actual breach in the treaty in early 148 bc , but the suspicion of numidia lasted in rome to affect jugurtha unfortunately for micipsa , this only served jugurtha , who used his time in spain to make several influential roman contacts under scipio aemilianus at the siege of numantia ( 134 & ndash ; 133 bc ) , serving alongside gaius marius , jugurtha learned of romans ' weakness for bribes and that powerful friends in rome can go a long way the roman officials settled the fight by dividing numidia into two parts , probably in 116 , but this settlement was tainted by accusations that the roman officials accepted bribes to favor jugurtha however , roman troops were engaged in the cimbrian war and the senate merely sent two successive embassies to remonstrate with jugurtha who delayed until he had captured cirta jugurtha also severely damaged his reputation and weakened his position by using his time in rome to set gangs onto a cousin , named massiva , a potential rival for the numidian throne the public opinion of roman citizens and elites , among the most powerful political forces in republican rome , turned against him and jugurtha was once again at war with the republic a series of incompetent generals of rome began this renewed war ; in 110 bc jugurtha forced capitulation of an entire army being led by aulus pstumius albinus and drove the romans out of numidia entirely at the outset of the major war ( 112â€“105 bc ) , bocchus stood out of the way of the issue , eventually joining jugurtha in the fighting against marius in 107 bc
