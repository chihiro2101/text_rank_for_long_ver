working primarily in the oem field , ati produced integrated graphics cards for pc manufacturers such as ibm and commodore by 1987 , ati had grown into an independent graphics-card retailer , introducing ega wonder and vga wonder card product lines that year history of amd at amd.com in the early nineties , they released products able to process graphics without the cpu : in may 1991 , the mach8 , in 1992 the mach32 , which offered improved memory bandwidth and gui acceleration in 1994 , the mach64 accelerator debuted , powering the graphics xpression and graphics pro turbo , offering hardware support for yuv-to-rgb color space conversion in addition to hardware zoom ; early techniques of hardware-based video acceleration the ati rage line powered almost the entire range of ati graphics products the all-in-wonder product line , introduced in 1996 , was the first combination of integrated graphics chip with tv tuner card and the first chip that enabled display of computer graphics on a tv set history of amd – 1996 at amd.com the cards featured 3d acceleration powered by ati 's 3d rage ii , 64-bit 2d performance , tv-quality video acceleration , analog video capture , tv tuner functionality , flicker-free tv-out and stereo tv audio reception right in addition to developing high-end gpus ( originally called a vpu , visual processing unit , by ati ) for pcs and apple macs , ati also designed embedded versions for laptops ( mobility radeon ) , pdas and mobile phones ( imageon ) , integrated motherboards ( radeon igp ) , and others ati wonder series – series of 8-bit isa cards with mda , hercules , cga and plantronics color+ compatibility using the united microelectronics corporation ( umc ) motorola 6845 the rage ii was used in the first ati all-in-wonder multi-function video card , and more advanced all-in-wonders based on rage series gpus followed they introduced innovations such as modularized ram chips , dvd ( mpeg2 ) acceleration , notebook gpu card sockets , and '' powerplay '' power management technology it allowed , by using a secondary video card and a dual pci-e motherboard based on an ati crossfire compatible chipset , the ability to combine the power of the two , three or four video cards to increase performance through a variety of different rendering options firegl/firepro – launched in 2001 , following ati 's acquisition of firegl graphics from diamond multimedia firemv – for workstations , featuring '' multi-view '' , for multiple displays with 2d acceleration only , usually based on low-end products of the radeon series ( now integrated into firepro series ) although amd strongly considered making the functional part of the ati drivers '' open source '' , before the merger with amd , ati had no plans to release their graphics drivers as free software : in addition to the above chipset , ati struck a deal in 2005 , with cpu and motherboard manufacturers , particularly asus and intel , to create onboard 3d graphics solutions for intel 's range of motherboards released with their range of intel pentium m-based desktop processors , the intel core and intel core 2 processors , the d101ggc and d101ggc2 chipset ( codenamed '' grand county '' intel boxed desktop board quick guide ( december 2006 ) ) based on the xpress 200 chipset however , high-end boards with integrated graphics processor ( igp ) still used intel gma graphics processing units xenos – microsoft 's xbox 360 video game console contains a custom graphics chip produced by ati , known as '' r500 '' , '' c1 '' , or more often as xenos imageon – announced in february 2006 , allowing handhelds devices to receive digital broadcast tv ( dvb-h ) signals and enables watching tv programs on these devices , the chipset includes tuner , demodulator , decoder , and a full software stack , operates alongside the imageon chip besides full products , ati also supplied 3d and 2d graphics components to other vendors , specifically the qualcomm page 10 and 15 msm7000 series soc chips of handheld and upcoming freescale i comparison of ati chipsets comparison of ati graphics processing units fglrx – linux display driver used for ati video cards radeon radeon r800 video card video in video out
