a vast and unprecedented international star-mapping project was initiated in 1887 by paris observatory director amédée mouchez , who realized the potential of the new dry plate to revolutionize the process of making maps of the stars as a result of the astrographic congress of more than 50 astronomers held in paris in april 1887 , 20 observatories from around the world agreed to participate in the project , and two goals were established : for the first , the astrographic catalogue , the entire sky was to be photographed to 11 & nbsp ; mag to provide a reference catalogue of star positions that would fill the magnitude gap between those previously observed by transit and meridian circle instrument observations down to 8 & nbsp ; mag & ndash ; this would provide the positions of a reasonably dense network of star positions which could in turn be used as a reference system for the fainter survey component ( the carte du ciel ) the astrographic catalogue plates , of typically 6 & nbsp ; minutes exposure , were in due course photographed , measured , and published in their entirety turner , 1912 the great star map , being a brief general account of the international project known as the astrographic chart ( john murray ) other aspects are covered in various papers in the proceedings of iau symposium number & nbsp ; 133 held in 1988 many factors , such as reference catalogue , reduction technique and print formats were left up to the individual institutions the '' computers '' would manually measure each star with respect to the dozen or so reference stars within that particular plate , and then perform calculations to determine the star 's right ascension and declination the data were difficult to work with because they were available neither in machine-readable form nor in equatorial coordinates the plates which were taken generally still exist , but cover only half of the sky the vast amount of work invested in the astrographic catalogue , taking plates , measuring , and publishing , looked for a long time as giving only a marginal scientific profit but today , astronomers are very much indebted to this great effort because of the possibility of combining these century-old star positions with the results from esa 's hipparcos space astrometry satellite , allowing high accuracy proper motions to be derived for 2.5 & nbsp ; million stars the proper motions of all the tycho catalogue stars could then be derived especially thanks to the astrographic catalogue , but additionally using star positions from more than 140 other ground-based catalogues
