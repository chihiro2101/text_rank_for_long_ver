intermediate filaments are composed of various proteins , depending on the type of cell in which they are found ; they are normally 8-12 & nbsp ; nm in diameter accessory proteins including motor proteins regulate and link the filaments to other cell compounds and each other and are essential for controlled assembly of cytoskeletal filaments in particular locations microfilaments , also known as actin filaments , are composed of linear polymers of g-actin proteins , and generate force when the growing ( plus ) end of the filament pushes against a barrier , such as the cell membrane intermediate filaments are a part of the cytoskeleton of many eukaryote cells intermediate filaments organize the internal tridimensional structure of the cell , anchoring organelles and serving as structural components of the nuclear lamina keratin intermediate filaments in epithelial cells provide protection for different mechanical stresses the skin may endure in combination with proteins and desmosomes , the intermediate filaments form cell-cell connections and anchor the cell-matrix junctions that are used in messaging between cells as well as vital functions of the cell these connections allow the cell to communicate through the desmosome of multiple cells to adjust structures of the tissue based on signals from the cells environment as both flagella and cilia are structural components of the cell , and are maintained by microtubules , they can be considered part of the cytoskeleton different septins form protein complexes with each other the function of septins in cells include serving as a localized attachment site for other proteins , and preventing the diffusion of certain molecules from one cell compartment to another cortical patches are discrete actin bodies on the membrane and are vital for endocytosis , especially the recycling of glucan synthase which is important for cell wall synthesis actin cables are bundles of actin filaments and are involved in the transport of vesicles towards the cap ( which contains a number of different proteins to polarize cell growth ) and in the positioning of mitochondria , 2001 , the cell wall was believed to be the deciding factor for many bacterial cell shapes , including rods and spirals three laboratories independently discovered that ftsz , a protein already known as a key player in bacterial cytokinesis , had the '' tubulin signature sequence '' present in all α- , β- , and γ-tubulins prokaryotic actin-like proteins , such as mreb , are involved in the maintenance of cell shape all non-spherical bacteria have genes encoding actin-like proteins , and these proteins form a helical network beneath the cell membrane that guides the proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis filaments of parm exhibit dynamic instability , and may partition plasmid dna into the dividing daughter cells by a mechanism analogous to that used by microtubules during eukaryotic mitosis crescentin is also involved in maintaining cell shape , such as helical and vibrioid forms of bacteria , but the mechanism by which it does this is currently unclear these filament forming proteins have been classified into 4 classes cytoskeletal proteins are usually correlated with cell shape , dna segregation and cell division in prokaryotes and eukaryotes for example , dna segregation in all eukaryotes happens through use of tubulin , but in prokaryotes either waca proteins , actin-like or tubulin-like proteins can be used cell division is mediated in eukaryotes by actin , but in prokaryotes usually by tubulin-like ( often ftsz-ring ) proteins and sometimes ( crenarchaeota ) escrt-iii , which in eukaryotes still has a role in the last step of division & nbsp ; plant and algae cells are generally larger than many other cells ; so cytoplasmic streaming is important in these types of cells
