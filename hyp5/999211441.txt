it is most obvious in nidifugous birds , which imprint on their parents and then follow them around 268 lorenz demonstrated how incubator-hatched geese would imprint on the first suitable moving stimulus they saw within what he called a '' critical period '' between 13 and 16 hours shortly after hatching the filial imprinting of birds was a primary technique used to create the movie winged migration ( le peuple migrateur ) , which contains a great deal of footage of migratory birds in flight this behaviour was used to determine that very young chicks of a few days old have rudimentary counting skills for example , male zebra finches appear to prefer mates with the appearance of the female bird that rears them , rather than that of the birth parent when they are different the breeder then courts a suitable imprint female bird ( including offering food , if it is part of that species 's normal courtship ) it is one of the suggested explanations for the claim that the experiences of an infant , particularly during the first two years of his life , contribute to his lifelong developmental psychology evolutionary trends within the animal kingdom have been shown to show substantive increase in the forebrain particularly towards the limbic system , this evolution has even been thought of to have a mutative effect on the brain size trickling down the human ancestry reverse sexual imprinting is also seen in instances where two people who live in domestic proximity during the first few years in the life of either one become desensitized to later close sexual attraction the westermarck effect has since been observed in many places and cultures , including in the israeli kibbutz system , and the chinese shim-pua marriage customs , as well as in biological-related families a study of the marriage patterns of these children later in life revealed that out of the nearly 3,000 marriages that occurred across the kibbutz system , only fourteen were between children from the same peer group when proximity during this critical period does not occur—for example , where a brother and sister are brought up separately , never meeting one another—they may find one another highly sexually attractive when they meet as adults in human–computer interaction , baby duck syndrome denotes the tendency for computer users to '' imprint '' on the first system they learn , then judge other systems by their similarity to that first system '' baby duck syndrome : imprinting on your first system makes change a very hard thing '' , peter seebach , ibm developerworks , 2 march 2005 the issue may present itself relatively early in a computer user 's experience , and it has been observed to impede education of students in new software systems or user interfaces .
