characteristics of consensus decision-making include : collaboration : participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible cooperation : participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members , rather than competing for personal preferences proponents claim that outcomes of the consensus process include : better decisions : through including the input of all stakeholders the resulting proposals may better address all potential concerns better implementation : a process that includes and respects all parties , and generates as much agreement as possible sets the stage for greater cooperation in implementing the resulting decisions to ensure the agreement or consent of all participants is valued , many groups choose unanimity or near-unanimity as their decision rule simply vetoing a decision is not considered a responsible use of consensus blocking some common guidelines for the use of consensus blocking include : providing an option for those who do not support a proposal to “ stand aside ” rather than block a participant who does not support a proposal may have alternatives to simply blocking it some common options may include the ability to : declare reservations : group members who are willing to let a motion pass but desire to register their concerns with the group may choose '' declare reservations stand aside : a '' stand aside '' may be registered by a group member who has a '' serious personal disagreement '' with a proposal , but is willing to let the motion pass although stand asides do not halt a motion , it is often regarded as a strong '' nay vote '' and the concerns of group members standing aside are usually addressed by modifications to the proposal stand asides may also be registered by users who feel they are incapable of adequately understanding or participating in the proposal the basic model for achieving consensus as defined by any decision rule involves : collaboratively generating a proposal identifying unsatisfied concerns modifying the proposal to generate as much agreement as possible all attempts at achieving consensus begin with a good faith attempt at generating full-agreement , regardless of decision rule threshold the general direction of the group and potential proposals for action are often identified during the discussion each member of the group usually must actively state whether they agree or consent , stand aside , or object , often by using a hand gesture or raising a colored card , to avoid the group warnock 's dilemma the quaker model is intended to allow hearing individual voices while providing a mechanism for dealing with disagreements its process includes : multiple concerns and information are shared until the sense of the group is clear should some dissenter 's perspective not harmonize with the others , that dissenter may '' stand aside '' to allow the group to proceed , or may opt to '' block '' key components of quaker-based consensus include a belief in a common humanity and the ability to decide together in the quaker model , as with other consensus decision-making processes , articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them the consensus decision-making process often has several roles designed to make the process run more effectively facilitators accept responsibility for moving through the agenda on time ; ensuring the group adheres to the mutually agreed-upon mechanics of the consensus process ; and , if necessary , suggesting alternate or additional discussion or decision-making techniques , such as go-arounds , break-out groups or role-playing consensor : the team of consensors is responsible for accepting those relevant proposals which conform with the un charter on human rights ; for displaying an initial list of these options ; for drawing up a balanced list of options to represent the entire debate ; to analyse the preferences cast in any subsequent mbc ballot ; and , if need be , to determine the composite decision from the two most popular options in this method each member of the group can hold up a fist to indicate blocking consensus , one finger to suggest changes , two fingers to discuss minor issues , three fingers to indicate willingness to let issue pass without further discussion , four fingers to affirm the decision as a good idea , and five fingers to volunteer to take a lead in implementing the decision critics of consensus blocking often observe that the option , while potentially effective for small groups of motivated or trained individuals with a sufficiently high degree of affinity , has a number of possible shortcomings , notably preservation of the status quo : in decision-making bodies that use formal consensus , the ability of individuals or small minorities to block agreement gives an enormous advantage to anyone who supports the existing state of affairs this can mean that a specific state of affairs can continue to exist in an organization long after a majority of members would like it to change the incentive to block can however be removed by using a special kind of voting process susceptibility to widespread disagreement : giving the right to block proposals to all group members may result in the group becoming hostage to an inflexible minority or individual when a popular proposal is blocked the group actually experiences widespread disagreement , the opposite of the consensus process 's goal stagnation and group dysfunction : when groups can not make the decisions necessary to function ( because they can not resolve blocks ) , they may lose effectiveness in accomplishing their mission channeling decisions away from an inclusive group process : when group members view the status quo as unjustly difficult to change through a whole group process , they may begin to delegate decision-making to smaller committees or to an executive committee studies of effective consensus process usually indicate a shunning of unanimity or '' illusion of unanimity '' that does not hold up as a group comes under real-world pressure ( when dissent reappears ) they may be symptoms of a systemic bias , a rigged process ( where an agenda is not published in advance or changed when it becomes clear who is present to consent ) , fear of speaking one 's mind , a lack of creativity ( to suggest alternatives ) or even a lack of courage ( to go further along the same road to a more extreme solution that would not achieve unanimous consent ) some proponents of consensus decision-making view procedures that use majority rule as undesirable for several reasons members of a minority position may feel less commitment to a majority decision , and even majority voters who may have taken their positions along party or bloc lines may have a sense of reduced responsibility for the ultimate decision the result of this reduced commitment , according to many consensus proponents , is potentially less willingness to defend or act upon the decision another method to promote agreement is to use a voting process under which all members of the group have a strategic incentive to agree rather than block in the abilene paradox , a group can unanimously agree on a course of action that no individual member of the group desires because no one individual is willing to go against the perceived will of the decision-making body additionally , the time commitment required to engage in the consensus decision-making process can sometimes act as a barrier to participation for individuals unable or unwilling to make the commitment japanese companies normally use consensus decision-making , meaning that unanimous support on the board of directors is sought for any decision '' one tradition in support of rough consensus is the tradition of humming rather than ( countable ) hand-raising ; this allows a group to quickly discern the prevalence of dissent , without making it easy to slip into majority rule
