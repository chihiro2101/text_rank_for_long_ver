control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience ; volkswagen 's '' coolant controlled exhaust gas recirculation '' system of 1973 exemplified this evolution : a coolant temperature sensor blocked vacuum to the egr valve until the engine reached normal operating temperature moreover , the egr valve was controlled , in part , by vacuum drawn from the carburetor venturi , which allowed more precise constraint of egr flow to only those engine load conditions under which is likely to form '' 1973 cleaner air system highlights '' â€“ chrysler corporation , imperialclub.com later , backpressure transducers were added to the egr valve control to further tailor egr flow to engine load conditions a properly operating egr can theoretically increase the efficiency of gasoline engines via several mechanisms : reduced throttling losses the addition of inert exhaust gas into the intake system means that for a given power output , the throttle plate must be opened further , resulting in increased inlet manifold pressure and reduced throttling losses lowered peak combustion temperatures not only reduces formation , it also reduces the loss of thermal energy to combustion chamber surfaces , leaving more available for conversion to mechanical work during the expansion stroke egr is typically not employed at high loads because it would reduce peak power output unlike spark-ignition engines , diesels are not limited by the need for a contiguous flamefront ; furthermore , since diesels always operate with excess air , they benefit from egr rates as high as 50 % ( at idle , when there is otherwise a large excess of air ) in controlling emissions however , adding egr to a diesel reduces the specific heat ratio of the combustion gases in the power stroke egr also tends to reduce the amount of fuel burned in the power stroke the most common is a diesel particulate filter ( dpf ) in the exhaust system which cleans the exhaust but causes a constant minor reduction in fuel efficiency due to the back pressure created egr systems can also add abrasive contaminants and increase engine oil acidity , which in turn can reduce engine longevity
