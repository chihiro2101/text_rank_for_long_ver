they are categorized as actin fold proteins , sharing a common atp binding site core that is surrounded by more variable sequences which determine substrate affinities and other properties in patients with essential fructosuria , metabolism of fructose by hexokinase to fructose-6-phosphate is the primary method of metabolizing dietary fructose ; this pathway is not significant in normal individuals there are four important mammalian hexokinase isozymes that vary in subcellular locations and kinetics with respect to different substrates and conditions , and physiological function hexokinase i/a is found in all mammalian tissues , and is considered a '' housekeeping enzyme , '' unaffected by most physiological , hormonal , and metabolic changes hexokinase ii/b constitutes the principal regulated isoform in many cell types and is increased in many cancers hexokinase iv is present in the liver , pancreas , hypothalamus , small intestine , and perhaps certain other neuroendocrine cells , and plays an important regulatory role in carbohydrate metabolism glucose is unique in that it can be used to produce atp by all cells in both the presence and absence of molecular oxygen ( o 2 ) hexokinases i and ii can associate physically to the outer surface of the external membrane of mitochondria through specific binding to a porin , or voltage dependent anion channel mitochondrial hexokinase is highly elevated in rapidly growing malignant tumor cells , with levels up to 200 times higher than normal tissues it appears as if hexokinase possesses a single potential transmembrane domain located around amino acid 400 therefore , hexokinase is most likely not an integral membrane protein in yeast
