talking about his depiction of quark , shimerman said the character developed significantly during the start of the sixth season of deep space nine , during a story arc in which the dominion took control of the deep space nine station : originally , quark admired the cardassian race for their version of morality , but later he seemed to take pity on the downtrodden bajoran people , selling them food and equipment just above cost , which could have gotten him into serious trouble if the cardassians had found out commander sisko , feeling that quark 's bar ( which offered holosuites and gambling ) would encourage commercial tourism to boost the station 's economy , extorted quark into staying , using quark 's nephew nog as a bargaining chip , in the deep space nine pilot episode , '' emissary '' quark engages in a variety of shady deals , but neither sisko nor odo , quark 's nominal nemesis and head of station security , take serious action against him , partially because his value outweighs his numerous illegal activities , which for the most part , harm no one the two meet initially in a scandal involving quark 's mother ishka , who had earned profit despite this being illegal for a female nonetheless , in true ferengi fashion , he treated rom with little respect and ordered him about like a servant they were partners in many other business ventures , although quark routinely made sure to keep rom in the dark about the true nature of their dealings when odo finally left the station to rejoin the great link at the end of the series , quark came to say goodbye , and made a toast to odo in '' move along home '' when he was apparently forced to sacrifice one of four crew members ( sisko , dax , bashir and kira ) in a strange alien game , he refused to make a choice , begging for their lives quark has a cousin , gaila , who is an arms dealer and has become successful enough to buy his own moon he was married to ( and divorced from ) a klingon ( grilka ) in an incident that also garnered him considerable respect from the klingon community for his bravery , when he exposed how her husband 's rival had tried to attack his house through business measures rather than a straightforward duel and then provoked said rival into trying to kill quark in a duel when quark was unarmed and had freely acknowledged that he would lose in the non-canon novels set after the series , quark starts a romantic relation with ro laren who has taken odo 's place as head of security at first he appears much the same as his regular counterpart ( although mirror quark has no idea what 'gold pressed latinum ' - a staple of ferengi currency - is ) , but it 's soon revealed that mirror quark is actively helping terran slaves escape the cruelty of the klingon/cardassian alliance
