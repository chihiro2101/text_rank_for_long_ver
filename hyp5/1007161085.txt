to enable a person to find a book of which either ( identifying objective ) the author the title the subject the date of publication 2 if an item is not found in the catalog , the user may continue their search at another library a catalog card is an individual entry in a library catalog containing bibliographic information , including author 's name , book title , and even approximate location using these books in a new system of public libraries included an inventory of all books the backs of the playing cards contained the bibliographic information for each book and this inventory became known as the '' french cataloging code of 1791 '' english inventor francis ronalds began using a catalog of cards to manage his growing book collection around 1815 , which has been denoted as the first practical use of the system the first issue of library journal , the official publication of the american library association , made clear that the most pressing issues facing libraries were the lack of a standardized catalog and an agency to administer a centralized catalog by the end of the nineteenth century , the bigger card won out , mainly to the fact that the card was already the “ postal size ” used for postcards melvil dewey saw well beyond the importance of standardized cards and sought to outfit virtually all facets of library operations in one of its early distribution catalogs , the bureau pointed out that “ no other business had been organized with the definite purpose of supplying libraries ” dewey and others devised a system where books were organized by subject , then alphabetized based on the author 's name work on the catalog began in 1862 and within the first year , 35,762 catalog cards had been created one of the first acts of the newly formed american library association in 1908 was to set standards for the size of the cards used in american libraries , thus making their manufacture and the manufacture of cabinets , uniform this was a widespread form of card catalog in north american libraries prior to the introduction of the computer-based catalog this catalog may also serve as the primary inventory for the library the earliest librarians created rules for how to record the details of the catalog subject catalogs were the rule of the day , and author catalogs were unknown at that time the frequent use of subject-only catalogs hints that there was a code of practice among early catalog librarians and that they followed some set of rules for subject assignment and the recording of the details of each item before printing , librarians had to enter new acquisitions into the margins of the catalog list until a new one was created because of the nature of creating texts at this time , most catalogs were not able to keep up with new acquisitions printed catalogs , sometimes called dictionary catalogs , began to be published in the early modern period and enabled scholars outside a library to gain an idea of its contents card for personal filing systems , enabling much more flexibility , and towards the end of the 20th century the online public access catalog was developed ( see below ) the beginning of the library of congress 's catalog card service in 1911 led to the use of these cards in the majority of american libraries this became a new organization method for catalogs he had organized his library by adapting francis bacon 's organization of knowledge , specifically using memory , reason , and imagination as his three areas , which were then broken down into 44 subdivisions in a title catalog , one can distinguish two sort orders : in the grammatical sort order ( used mainly in older catalogs ) , the most important word of the title is the first sort term simply put , authority control is defined as the establishment and maintenance of consistent forms of terms – such as names , subjects , and titles – to be used as headings in bibliographic records in many catalogs , parts of the bible are sorted under the standard name of the book ( s ) they contain should an english catalog follow this suit ? and should a dutch catalog sort non-dutch words the same way ? ( there are also pseudo-ligatures which sometimes come at the beginning of a word , such as œdipus in a subject catalog , one has to decide on which classification system to use the cataloger will select appropriate subject headings for the bibliographic item and a unique classification number ( sometimes known as a '' call number '' ) which is used not only for identification but also for the purposes of shelving , placing items with similar subjects near one another , which aids in browsing by library users , who are thus often able to take advantage of serendipity in their search process
