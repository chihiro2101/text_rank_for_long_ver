fisher suggested a probability of one in twenty ( 0.05 ) as a convenient cutoff level to reject the null hypothesis in his 1956 publication statistical methods and scientific inference , he recommended that significance levels be set according to specific circumstances \alpha is also called the significance level , and is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is true ( a type i error ) for example , when \alpha is set to 5 % , the conditional probability of a type i error , given that the null hypothesis is true , is 5 % , and a statistically significant result is one where the observed p-value is less than ( or equal to ) 5 % the use of a one-tailed test is dependent on whether the research question or alternative hypothesis specifies a direction such as whether a group of objects is heavier or the performance of students on an assessment is better as a result , the null hypothesis can be rejected with a less extreme result if a one-tailed test was used a study that is found to be statistically significant may not necessarily be practically significant to gauge the research significance of their result , researchers are encouraged to always report an effect size along with p-values starting in the 2010s , some journals began questioning whether significance testing , and particularly using a threshold of 5 % , was being relied on too heavily as the primary measure of validity of a hypothesis using bayesian statistics can avoid confidence levels , but also requires making additional assumptions , and may not necessarily improve practice regarding statistical testing in 2016 , the american statistical association ( asa ) published a statement on p-values , saying that '' the widespread use of 'statistical significance ' ( generally interpreted as p & nbsp ; ≤ 0.05 ' ) as a license for making a claim of a scientific finding ( or implied truth ) leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process '' additionally , the change to 0.005 would increase the likelihood of false negatives , whereby the effect being studied is real , but the test fails to show it a/b testing , abx test fisher 's method for combining independent tests of significance look-elsewhere effect multiple comparisons problem sample size texas sharpshooter fallacy ( gives examples of tests where the significance level was set too high ) lydia denworth , '' a significant problem : standard scientific methods are under fire '' the use of p value for nearly a century since 1925 to determine statistical significance of experimental results has contributed to an illusion of certainty and to reproducibility in many science some researchers suggest changing statistical methods , whereas others would do away with a threshold for defining '' significant '' results statistical significance : rationale , validity and utility , volume 1 of series introducing statistical methods , sage publications ltd , – argues that statistical significance is useful in certain circumstances
