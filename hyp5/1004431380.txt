the slowing that occurred with rocksteady allowed bass players to explore more broken , syncopated figures , playing a counterpoint to the repetitive rhythm of the guitar and keyboards and this new style eventually largely replaced the walking patterns that had been so characteristic of many ska recordings whereas , in ska , the horn section had often spent much of the song playing the offbeats with the guitar and piano , in rocksteady they favored repeated rhythmic patterns or simply sitting out all together until the lead line due in part to the heavy borrowing from us soul songs , many rocksteady songs are love songs ; e.g rocksteady 's dominance meant that all record labels of the time released music in the genre ; studio one , bunny lee and prince buster were predominant , with reid when ska band the skatalites disbanded ( 64/65—accounts vary ) mccook went to work at the treasure isle label and jackie mittoo went to the studio one label—these two artists/arrangers became instrumental in the way these two labels became dominant and helped to form the sound of rocksteady the emigration to canada of key musical arrangers jackie mittoo and lynn taitt—and the upgrading of jamaican studio technology—had a marked effect on the sound and style of the recordings also around this time ( 1969–70 ) the use of a vocal-free or lead instrument-free dub or b-side '' version '' became popular in jamaica ; at the beginning this involved the use of rocksteady tracks , most notably with u-roy deejaying over treasure isle rhythms ( made by a young osbourne ruddock , later known as king tubby , beginning with '' wake the town '' ) indeed , this collaboration provided rocksteady with an afterlife as u-roy rocksteady-based songs rode high in the charts ( 1970–71 ) even as reggae began to establish itself as the new sound many reggae songs became focused less on romance and more on black consciousness , politics and protest many bass lines originally created for rocksteady songs continue to be used in contemporary jamaican music
