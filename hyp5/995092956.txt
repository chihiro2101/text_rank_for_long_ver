as shown , a pinhole '' lens '' is simply a small aperture that blocks most rays of light , ideally selecting one ray to the object for each point on the image sensor pinhole lenses have a few severe limitations : a pinhole camera with a large aperture is blurry because each pixel is essentially the shadow of the aperture stop , so its size is no smaller than the size of the aperture ( third image ) practical lenses can be thought of as an answer to the question : '' how can a pinhole lens be modified to admit more light and give a smaller spot size ? '' a first step is to put a simple convex lens at the pinhole with a focal length equal to the distance to the film plane ( assuming the camera will take pictures of distant objects if the object is at a distance , one can assume the light rays will arrive perpendicular to the plane of the lens , and thus converge at the focal point the geometry is almost the same as with a simple pinhole lens , but rather than being illuminated by single rays of light , each image point is illuminated by a focused pencil ( optics ) the additional elements allow lens designers to reduce various aberrations , but the principle of operation remains the same : pencil beam are collected at the entrance pupil and focused down from the exit pupil onto the image plane the lens usually is focused by adjusting the distance from the lens assembly to the image plane , or by moving elements of the lens assembly glass is the most common material used to construct lens elements , due to its good optical properties and resistance to scratching a shutter , to regulate the time during which light may pass , may be incorporated within the lens assembly ( for better quality imagery ) , within the camera , or even , rarely , in front of the lens for a given photographic system the focal length determines the angle of view , short focal lengths giving a wider field of view than longer focal length lenses practical lens assemblies may also contain mechanisms to deal with measuring light , secondary apertures for flare reduction , and mechanisms to hold the aperture open until the instant of exposure to allow slr cameras to focus with a brighter image with shallower depth of field , theoretically allowing better focus accuracy the most common type of long-focus lens is the telephoto lens , a design that uses special optical configurations to make the lens shorter than its focal length a side effect of using lenses of different focal lengths is the different distances from which a subject can be framed , resulting in a different perspective photographs can be taken of a person stretching out a hand with a wideangle , a normal lens , and a telephoto , which contain exactly the same image size by changing the distance from the subject an extreme wideangle lens of large aperture must be of very complex construction to correct for optical aberrations , which are worse at the edge of the field and when the edge of a large lens is used for image-forming a long-focus lens of small aperture can be of very simple construction to attain comparable image quality : a doublet ( two elements ) will often suffice the reflection of light at each of the many interfaces between different optical media ( air , glass , plastic ) seriously degraded the contrast and color saturation of early lenses , particularly zoom lenses , especially where the lens was directly illuminated by a light source the introduction many years ago of optical coatings , and advances in coating technology over the years , have resulted in major improvements , and modern high-quality zoom lenses give images of quite acceptable contrast , although zoom lenses with many elements will transmit less light than lenses made with fewer elements ( all other factors such as aperture , focal length , and coatings being equal ) the lenses attach to the camera using a lens mount , which contains mechanical linkages and often also electrical contacts between the lens and camera body the lens mount design is an important issue for compatibility between cameras and lenses a macro lens may be of any focal length , the actual focus length being determined by its practical use , considering magnification , the required ratio , access to the subject , and illumination considerations some lenses , called zoom lenses , have a focal length that varies as internal elements are moved , typically by rotating the barrel or pressing a button which activates an electric motor shift lens allow the lens to be raised or lowered relative to the film of sensor plane to correct or exaggerate perspective distortion shift lenses and tilt/shift lenses ( collectively perspective control lenses ) allow special control of perspective on slr cameras by mimicking view camera movements
