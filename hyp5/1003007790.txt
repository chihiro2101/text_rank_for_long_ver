when onegin arrives , he finds instead a boisterous country ball , a rural parody of and contrast to the society balls of st tatyana visits onegin 's mansion , where she looks through his books and his notes in the margins , and begins to question whether onegin 's character is merely a collage of different literary heroes , and if there is , in fact , no '' real onegin '' one of the main themes of eugene onegin is the relationship between fiction and real life pushkin , in the final chapter , fuses his muse and tatyana 's new 'form ' in society after a lengthy description of how she has guided him in his works perhaps the darkest theme – despite the light touch of the narration – is pushkin 's presentation of the deadly inhumanity of social convention his inability to relate to the feelings of others and his entire lack of empathy – the cruelty instilled in him by the '' world '' – is epitomized in the very first stanza of the first book by his stunningly self-centered thoughts about being with the dying uncle whose estate he is to inherit : : '' but god how deadly dull to sample : sickroom attendance night and day : thus , onegin has lost his love , killed his only friend , and found no satisfaction in his life the conflict between art and life was no mere fiction in russia , but is in fact illustrated by pushkin 's own fate : he too was killed in a duel , falling victim to the social conventions of russian high society as with many other 19th-century novels , onegin was written and published serially , with parts of each chapter often appearing in magazines before the first printing of each chapter many changes , some small and some large , were made from the first appearance to the final edition during pushkin 's lifetime the following dates mostly come from nabokov 's study of the photographs of pushkin 's drafts that were available at the time , as well as other people 's work on the subject chapter 1 was first published as a whole in a booklet on february 16 , 1825 , with a foreword which suggests that pushkin had no clear plan on how ( or even whether ) he would continue the novel by the end of the year , pushkin had written 23 stanzas and had reached xxvii by january 5 , 1825 , at which point he started writing stanzas for onegin 's journey and worked on other pieces of writing the writing of chapter 5 began on january 4 , 1826 , and 24 stanzas were complete before the start of his trip to petition the tsar for his freedom when nabokov carried out his study on the writing of onegin , the manuscript of chapter 6 was lost , but it is known that pushkin started chapter 6 before finishing chapter 5 most of chapter 6 appears to have been written before the beginning of december 19 , 1826 when pushkin returned to moscow after exile on his family estate many stanzas appeared to have been written between november 22 and 25 , 1826 pushkin started writing chapter 7 in march 1827 , but aborted his original plan for the plot of the chapter and started on a different tack , completing the chapter on november 4 , 1828 pushkin intended to write a chapter called '' onegin 's journey '' , which occurred between the events of chapters 7 and 8 , and in fact was supposed to be the eighth chapter when pushkin completed chapter 8 , he published it as the final chapter and included within its denouement the line nine cantos i have written , still intending to complete this missing chapter during this time , he produced what nabokov describes as an '' incredible number of masterpieces '' and finished copying out chapter 8 on september 25 , 1830 this particular challenge and the importance of eugene onegin in russian literature have resulted in an impressive number of competing translations it is still considered one of the best translations the introduction discusses the structure of the novel , the onegin stanza in which it is written , and pushkin 's opinion of onegin ( using pushkin 's letters to his friends ) ; it likewise gives a detailed account of both the time over which pushkin wrote onegin and of the various forms in which the various parts of it appeared in publication before pushkin 's death ( after which there is a huge proliferation of the number of different editions ) the discussion of the onegin stanza in the first volume contains the poem on translating '' eugene onegin '' , which first appeared in print in the new yorker on january 8 , 1955 , and is written in two onegin stanzas ( poem is reproduced here ) nabokov reproduces the poem both so that the reader of his translation would have some experience of this unique form , and also to act as a further defence of his decision to write his translation in prose nabokov 's previously close friend edmund wilson reviewed nabokov 's translation in the new york review of books , which sparked an exchange of letters and an enduring falling-out between them in 1977 , charles johnston published another translation trying to preserve the onegin stanza , which is generally considered to surpass arndt 's falen ( the professor of russian at the university of tennessee ) published a translation in 1995 which was also influenced by nabokov 's translation , but preserved the onegin stanzas hofstadter 's translation employs a unique lexicon of both high and low register words , as well as unexpected and almost reaching rhymes that give the work a comedic flair wordsworths classics in 2005 published an english prose translation by roger clarke , which sought to retain the lyricism of pushkin 's russian there are at least eight published french translations of eugene onegin the most recent appeared in 2005 : the translator , andré markovicz , respects pushkin 's original stanzas eugene onegin was given a direct spanish translation preserving the original russian poetic form with notes and illustrations by alberto musso nicholas , published by mendoza , argentina , zeta publishers in april 2005 the latest translation was one by masao ozawa , published in 1996 , in which ozawa attempted to translate onegin into the form of japanese poetry the 1879 opera eugene onegin , by tchaikovsky , based on the story , is perhaps the version that most people are familiar with there are many recordings of the score , and it is one of the most commonly performed operas in the world a staged version was adapted by sigizmund krzhizhanovsky and slated for production in the soviet union in 1936 , directed by alexander tairov and with incidental music by sergei prokofiev , as part of the centennial celebration of pushkin 's death it successfully combines spoken dialogue and narration from the novel , with music arranged from tchaikovsky 's operatic score , and incorporates some striking theatrical sequences inspired by tatyana 's dreams in the original in 2016 , the legendary vakhtangov state academic theatre of russia put on a production of onegin starring sergei makovetsky , described as '' exuberant , indelible , and arrestingly beautiful '' by the new york times rather than being based solely on pushkin 's verse narrative , the musical takes equal inspiration from tchaikovsky 's opera , subtly incorporating musical motifs from the opera and even using its structure as a template in fact , it was gladstone 's time as assistant director for vancouver opera ’ s last production of tchaikovsky ’ s eugene onegin that opened his eyes to the story ’ s potential for musical adaptation since then , throughout new productions and casting changes , onegin has garnered generally favourable reviews ; for example , louis b furthermore , several critics have pointed out similarities to the smash hit hamilton and especially to natasha , pierre & the great comet of 1812 , a sung-through musical likewise inspired by a classic of russian literature ( in this case , a sliver of leo tolstoy ’ s war and peace ) , usually to onegin ’ s disadvantage one major difference from the novel is the duel : onegin is presented as deliberately shooting to kill lensky and is unrepentant at the end the film compresses the events of the novel somewhat : for example , the name day celebrations take place on the same day as onegin 's speech to tatyana the 1999 film , much like the 1988 film , also gives the impression that during the duel sequence onegin deliberately shoots to kill ledger with more of pushkin 's poetry ) what 's gained in translation an article by douglas hofstadter on the book , which explains how he can judge the relative worth of different translations of onegin without being able to read russian an audiobook narrated by stephen fry
