there is generally no implication that the state of dress objected to is of a sexual nature ; and if such an allegation were to be made , the act would generally be described as '' gross indecency '' during the victorian era , for example , exposure of a woman 's legs , and to some extent the arms , was considered indecent in much of the western world an adult woman exposing her navel was also considered indecent in parts of the west into the 1960s and 1970s , and even as late as the 1980s public clothing varies by country and may be regulated by law it is a broader offence than indecent exposure , but can only be committed in a public place where at least two people are present , who need not actually witness it in england and wales public nudity is not in itself illegal ; the use of the term '' indecent exposure '' dates back to earlier criminal law it is defined as the maximum penalty is two years ' imprisonment , very rare as most cases are dealt with by a fine or through community service if sentenced to a term of imprisonment or a community order in excess of 12 months such convicts ( offenders ) – or if the person they exposed themselves to was aged under 18 years old – they must appear on and sign the violent and sex offender register in the past public nudity in england and wales could also be punished as '' disorderly behaviour '' under the public order act 1986 , sections 4a and 5 however , the law was clarified in the spring of 2018 and those sections are no longer considered to apply to simple public nudity under scots law , '' indecent conduct '' in a public place , such as exposing the genitals or engaging in sexual activity , can constitute the common law offence of public indecency the laws governing indecent exposure in the united states vary according to location the phenomenon widely known as flashing , involving a woman exposing bare nipples by suddenly pulling up her shirt and bra , is public exposure and is therefore defined by statute in many states of the united states as prohibited criminal behavior held : '' the phrase 'indecent act ' connotes something more active , with greater moral turpitude than the mere state of being nude in a public place in australia , it is a summary or criminal offence in some states and territories to expose one 's genitals ( also referred to as – 'his or her person ' ) specific state acts , are as follows : australian capital territory – crimes act 1900 , section 393 – 'indecent exposure ' – penalty 12 months under the nudity act 1976 , the responsible minister may declare a public area where public nudity is permitted under the nudity ( prescribed areas ) act 1983 the responsible minister may declare a public area where public nudity is permitted however , it has been suggested that the word '' person '' in s5 of the ( nsw ) summary offences act is not limited to '' penis '' or '' vulva '' otherwise there is no specific law prohibiting nudity in public places , although lesser charges may apply depending on the behaviour of the individual in question the high court of new zealand has upheld a conviction of disorderly conduct for nudity in the street , because it was not a place where nudity was known to occur or commonplace being prosecuted for nudity on a public beach , or any place where nudity might be expected , is very unlikely
