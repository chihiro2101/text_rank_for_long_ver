in most versions of the series , arthur and ford eventually find themselves back on earth , but two million years in the past , marooned with a third of the golgafrincham population ( consisting of hairdressers , account executives , film makers , security guards , telephone sanitisers , and the like ) the original radio series and the television series end at this point , although a second radio series was made in which ford and arthur are rescued by ford 's cousin zaphod beeblebrox and have further adventures , and which ends with arthur stealing zaphod 's spaceship , the heart of gold ( which zaphod had himself stolen ) and striking out with only marvin the paranoid android , eddie the shipboard computer , a cloned archaeologist named lintilla , a bunch of appliances with genuine people personalities , and a rather battered copy of the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy for companionship in the novels and the new ( series 3 and onwards ) radio series ( the latter of which dismisses the events of the second radio series as one of zaphod 's '' psychotic episodes '' ) , ford and arthur escape prehistoric earth via an eddy in the space-time continuum and a time-travelling chesterfield sofa that deposits them in the middle of lord 's cricket ground at the climax of the final ( in more ways than one , it turns out ) match in the ashes series , the day before the destruction of earth by the vogons here he falls in love with a woman named fenchurch and seems set to live happily ever after – at least until the following – and final – novel , mostly harmless by the end of this fifth novel , earth and all of its possible permutations and alternate versions are destroyed once and for all , and everybody dies , at least as far as the novel goes the final ending here consists of the babel fish carried by arthur , trillian , ford , and random having a sense for self-preservation , i.e the guides batteries soon run out , however , so all the main characters are re-awakened on the exploding earth , at the exact point where mostly harmless left off in the 2005 christmas special of doctor who , '' the christmas invasion '' , the tenth doctor , played by david tennant , after having just finished saving the world still dressed in night clothes and a dressing-gown , compares himself to arthur dent whom he describes as a '' nice man '' which quite possibly suggests that the doctor has at some point been present in the same universe as the characters of the hitchhiker 's guide
