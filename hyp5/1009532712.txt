the player has up to three actions per turn , which are used to explore new stars and colonize or fortify worlds after releasing world tour golf , reiche created an advertising mock-up for what would become star control , showing a dreadnaught and some ships fighting originally called starcon , the game began as an evolution on concepts that reiche first created in archon : the light and the dark , as well as mail order monsters according to ford , '' starcon is really just archon with an s-t in front of it '' , pointing to the one-on-one combat and strategic modes of both games star control would base its combat sequences on the classic game spacewar ! , as well as the core experience of space combat game star raiders as ford and reiche were still building their workflow as a team , the game took on a more limited scope compared to the sequel fred ford 's first prototype was a two-player action game where the vux and yehat ships blow up asteroids , which led them to build the entire universe around that simple play experience the team preferred to iterate on ship designs rather than plan them , as they discovered different play-styles during testing but the idea was , your fleet of ships , your selection of ships in total was as strong as someone else 's , and then , it came down to which matchup did you find '' although the story does not factor heavily into the game , the character concepts were created based on the ship designs the team would begin with paper illustrations , followed by logical abilities for those ships , and a character concept that suited the ship 's look-and-feel they decided to organize the characters into nominally '' good and bad '' factions , each with seven unique races and ships , with the humans on the good side a separate team ported a stripped down version of the game to the commodore 64 , spectrum and amstrad , which meant reducing the number of ships to 8 , not to mention the introduction of new bugs and balance issues as stardock began developing their new star control game , they re-iterated that they did not acquire the copyright to the first two games , and that they would need a license from reiche and ford to use their content and lore
