three divine liturgies are in common use in the byzantine rite : the divine liturgy of st john chrysostom ( 5th century ) , used on most days of the year and as a vesperal liturgy on the annunciation in some traditions , saint basil 's liturgy is also celebrated on the feast of the cross on september 14 the divine liturgy consists of three interrelated parts ; when not in conjunction with vespers , the liturgies of john chrysostom and basil the great are structured thus : the liturgy of preparation , which includes the entry and vesting prayers of the priests and deacons and the prothesis ; the liturgy of the catechumens , so called because traditionally this is the only part they may attend ; the liturgy of the faithful , so called because in ancient times only baptized members in good standing were allowed to participate in modern times , closed communion applies only to holy communion – reception of the sacrament of eucharist this is the public part of the liturgy , in which both catechumens and baptized faithful would be in the nave : opening blessing by the priest he raises the gospel book , making the sign of the cross with it over the altar and proclaiming : '' blessed is the kingdom of trinity , now and ever and unto ages of ages '' , to which the response is '' amen '' first antiphon little litany second antiphon o monogenes yios little litany third antiphon small

and with our whole mind… '' litany for the departed – this is not said on sundays , great feasts or during the paschal season litany of the catechumens , and dismissal of the catechumens in the early church , only baptized members who could receive holy communion were allowed to attend this portion of the liturgy '' ( greek : '' ἄνω σχῶμεν τὰς καρδίας '' ) anaphora ( liturgy ) the epinikios hymnos or sanctus ( '' holy , holy , holy… '' ) the eucharistic canon , containing the anamnesis ( memorial of christ 's incarnation , death , and resurrection , and the words of institution ) epiklesis the

their own languages , followers of the byzantine rite apply to their eucharistic services but , while in english the same word ( as also the word '' mass '' ) is at times used to speak of the corresponding services of the oriental orthodox churches , the normal names used in those churches refers either to the aspect of offering/sacrifice ( qurbana in the syriac orthodox church ) , badarak in the armenian apostolic church , prosfora from greek προσφορά in the coptic orthodox church ) or of sanctifying ( keddase in the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church ) gregory is usually used during the feasts of the church but not exclusively the syriac orthodox church , the syriac catholic church , the syriac maronite church of antioch and the syro-malankara catholic church of the west syriac rite which is developed from the antiochene rite use a version of the divine liturgy of saint james which differs substantially from its byzantine rite counterpart , most notably in being substantially shorter ( it can be completed in under two hours , whereas the historic form of the byzantine rite liturgy prior to the revisions of st james , which resembles that of the byzantine rite liturgy , and is mandated on certain occasions , such as major feasts , the consecration of churches , and the first liturgies offered by newly ordained priests due to the long isolation of the saint thomas christians the rite of the syro-malankara catholic church shows some differences , so that this rite is called the malankara rite the main liturgy used by the coptic church is known as liturgy of saint basil the term liturgies of saint basil in a coptic context means not only the sole anaphora with or without the related prayers , but also the general order of the alexandrine rite liturgy the structure of the bohairic coptic version used today in the coptic church can be summarized as follow : anaphora : the sursum corda the preface , praising father as lord and everlasting king , as creator of heaven and earth , the sea and all that is in them , and as father of christ by whom all things were made the pre-sanctus , praising the father on his throne of glory and worshiped by the angelic hosts , so introducing the sanctus , conducted without the benedictus the post-sanctus , recalling the whole history of salvation , from the original sin to the incarnation , passion , resurrection of christ up to the last judgment the institution narrative the anamnesis , referring to the passion , resurrection and second coming of christ the oblation , offering to the father the eucharistic gifts the epiclesis , asking the holy spirit to come and to sanctify and manifest the gifts as the most holy ; then asking the holy spirit to make the bread the body and the chalice the blood of christ the intercessions , praying for the participants to become one single body , for the church , for the pope of alexandria and for all the ecclesiastic hierarchy , for the town and the harvest , for the floodings , for the living , for who have offered the eucharistic gifts , for the saints – naming mary , john the baptist , saint stephen , saint mark and saint basil ; then reading of the diptychs , followed by the prayers for the dead a prayer for the fruit of the eucharist and the final doxology the term liturgy of saint basil may refer also to the whole eucharistic liturgy which in the coptic church has the following structure : the last part of the offertory resembles an anaphora : after a dialogue , the priest blesses the congregation and proclaims a prayer of thanksgiving , giving thanks to god for his support to us , and asking him for a worthy participation to the liturgy after these readings , the trisagion is sung three times , each time with a different reference to the incarnation , passion , resurrection , thus addressing the trisagion to christ only the nicean creed is proclaimed , the priest washes his hands three times and sprinkles water on the congregation reciting the prayer of reconciliation which is a prayer of worthiness for all who attend the liturgy the elevation is similar to that in the byzantine rite , with the celebrant who raises the portion of the lamb engraved with a cross ( the ispadikon ) crying : '' the holy things for the holy ones '' the partaking of the eucharist follows , first the body of christ given to the celebrants , to the deacons and to the faithful who approach the sanctuary without shoes and then the blood of christ in the same order for the liturgy : holy patarag or in western armenian holy badarak , meaning 'sacrifice ' this book contains all of the prayers for the patarag assigned to the bishop ( if celebrating as a bishop ) , the celebrating priest , the deacon ( s ) , and the people , the last typically led by a choir with accompaniment before the end of the 10th century there were also other liturgical forms , such as the anaphora of st among the distinctive practices of the armenian patarag is the tradition that on the sundays of the fast before easter ( the great fast ) the curtain which hangs down in front of the elevated altar area ( armenian խորան khoran ) is never opened – even for the reading of the gospel , certain movable parts of the liturgy are omitted , the parts of the liturgy sung by the choir are said or chanted simply without adornment , there is no general confession , and there is no distribution of communion to the faithful this practice of fasting from the communion bread in preparation for easter may reflect an ancient custom of the church in jerusalem the assyrian church of the east , the ancient church of the east and their larger catholic counterparts ( the chaldean catholic church and the syro-malabar catholic church ) , which use the east syriac rite that they all inherit from the church of the east , employ one or more of three different eucharistic anaphoras when celebrating holy qurbana : anaphora of addai and mari ( or the hallowing of the apostles , i.e
