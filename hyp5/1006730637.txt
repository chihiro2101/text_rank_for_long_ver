a study of three potential reverses resulted in the approval of a very simple design bearing two wheatheads in memorial style because the coin was in great demand , and because to make a change would have required halting production , the decision was made to eliminate the initials entirely the mintage was extremely low compared to prior years ( see lincoln cent mintage figures ) mint released collector 's sets containing this design in copper prior to the public launch of this design in zinc the 2005 act that authorized the redesign for the bicentennial stated that another redesigned reverse for the lincoln cent will be minted which '' shall bear an image emblematic of president lincoln 's preservation of the united states of america as a single and united country '' '' the design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after december 31 , 2009 , shall bear an image emblematic of president lincoln 's preservation of united states of america as a single and united country on april 16 , 2009 the commission of fine arts ( cfa ) met and selected a design that showed 13 wheat sheaves bound together with a ring symbolizing american unity as one nation according to the mint , the 13 stripes on the shield '' represent the states joined in one compact union to support the federal government , represented by the horizontal bar above '' on the stand beside the press lay several hundred bright new pennies and several fine strips of copper initially the alloy of the lincoln cent followed that established for this denomination with the indian head design in 1864 , 95 % copper and 2.5 % tin and 2.5 % zinc numerous complaints about the gray color of the 1943 cents , especially that they could be mistaken for dimes , led to a change in composition of the wartime cent on january 1 , 1944 , the mint was able to adopt a modified alloy , the supply being derived from expended shell casings which , when melted , furnished a composition similar to the original , but with a much smaller trace of tin the original weight of was also restored mint officials felt that deletion of the tin content would have no adverse effect on the wearing qualities of the coin , whereas the manufacturing advantages to be gained with the alloy stabilized at 95 % copper and 5 % zinc would be of much benefit during the early 1970s , the price of copper rose to a point where the cent almost contained one cent 's worth of copper 1974 aluminum cent , and in 1973 , a total of 1,579,324 such coins were struck ( dated 1974 ) and ready for public release about a dozen aluminum cents are believed to still be in the hands of collectors , although they are now considered illegal to own in mid-1982 , the coin 's composition was changed again , this time to copper-plated zinc the copper-plated zinc cent coins are still being produced today except for the new lighter total coin weight of 2.5 & nbsp ; grams each , these newer coins are identical in diameter and thickness , and nearly in appearance , to the mostly copper ( 95 % ) cents issued before mid-1982 , which weighed 3.11 & nbsp ; grams each when the lincoln cent was introduced in 1909 , it was discovered that the coining dies and their curved fields were unable to be polished to proof coining condition by existing mint equipment when struck by the high pressure hydraulic press of the philadelphia mint medal room , the result was a semi-rough surface , a gentle luster and strongly defined wide square rims these coins were produced in very small numbers , and the dies quickly developed small marks , known as diagnostics sold for mere pennies over face during the years of production , they were not popular with collectors when new , the coins were wrapped in a tarnish-proof tissue , which over time proved to be anything but through mint errors , a number of rare and valuable lincoln cents have been produced however some errors were systemic , and produced a number of coins with exactly the same problem in the same year not identified until the 1970s , it shows the rty in liberty and the 190 of the date slightly doubled however , three of the four pairs of denver mint worn and overly polished dies then produced the weak d and no d varieties , making them appear as if they had been produced in philadelphia there are a few 1943 cents that were produced in bronze , as opposed to the steel/zinc composition used that year in 1955 , a hubbing error caused some cents to get struck with an obverse die which showed doubling in all of the obverse devices , producing a prominent doubling of the date , and to a less noticeable degree , the rest of the obverse doubled dies are known for practically every date in the lincoln cent series , but most are minor , and less impressive compared to the 1955 and the other doubled die varieties mentioned here however , as no proof cents were struck in philadelphia that year , they are easily distinguishable as errors , and highly valuable the reverse of some lincoln cents minted in 1998 , 1999 , and 2000 in philadelphia feature a larger-than-normal gap between the first two letters of america it has been suggested that the cent should be eliminated as a unit of currency for several reasons including that many americans do not actually spend them , but rather only receive them in change at stores and proceed to return them to a bank for higher denomination currencies , or cash them in at coin counter mint , which is a part of the us department of the treasury , implemented new regulations on december 14 , 2006 , which criminalize the melting of pennies and nickels and place limits on export of the coins for years , the mint 's production and shipping costs for cents have exceeded the face value of the coin when copper reached a record high in february 2011 , the melt value of a 95 % copper cent was more than three times its face value 1943 steel cent 1955 doubled-die cent 1974 aluminum cent large cent ( united states coin ) legal tender modernization act mill ( currency ) penny ( canadian coin ) penny debate in the united states ring cent take a penny , leave a penny united states mint coin production
