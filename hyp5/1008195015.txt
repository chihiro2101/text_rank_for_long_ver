following the introduction of general motors ' saturn brand automobile , chrysler promised a similar new brand designed to take saturn on with innovative design and building methods the main objective of chrysler acquiring american motors was the long established jeep vehicles , but renault forced the company to take on the contractual obligations of the passenger car models as part of the deal thus , '' eagle is a line of cars chrysler inherited from amc '' and the eagle marque was born under new ownership , chrysler quickly discontinued the domestic-built front-wheel drive alliance and encore that were developed under renault , but continued to build the four-wheel drive amc eagle crossover it was now called eagle wagon and marketed into the 1988 model year until production ended in december moreover , chrysler kept amc 's long established eagle brand by continuing to import the mid-sized renault 21 ( now named eagle medallion ) as well as starting production of the renault 25-based full-size sedan that was developed by amc ( now named eagle premier ) chrysler 's initial problem was that unlike the big three , which had multiple brands under their corporate name , american motors had sold passenger cars under its corporate initials of '' amc '' since 1970 thus , without having a separate brand from the now defunct company , chrysler looked to re-brand the legacy vehicles inherited through the purchase of amc under the eagle name instead of trying to fold those outside-designed products into chrysler 's existing branch structure the merger may have helped the individual dealerships that signed on , but it caused the nascent eagle division and its largely derivative models to compete unfavorably for attention with chrysler 's and plymouth 's often similar , but longer-established and better-recognized , lines of passenger cars in 1997 , the eagle vision was discontinued at the end of its design cycle , though the similar dodge intrepid and chrysler concorde were redesigned for 1998 and continued through 2004 prototypes , called the vancuren eagle were even spotted wearing the eagle logo , and vision production continued into september 1997 to provide dealers with enough stock of the older car to carry them through to the new car 's introduction the amc name disappeared with chrysler 's acquisition of the independent automaker , '' but the eagle name carried on , worn by various renault- and mitsubishi-sourced models through the â€˜ 90s , when it was finally retired in 1998
