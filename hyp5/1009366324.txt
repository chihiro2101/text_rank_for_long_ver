staurakios was not given an official government position upon his father 's accession to the throne , but , in the summer of 803 , bardanes tourkos revolted against nikephoros in the anatolic theme ; although his revolt was put down by early september , it convinced nikephoros to consolidate his hold on the throne by declaring staurakios co-emperor and heir , which he did on 25 december 803 by doing so , nikephoros removed any question of the imperial succession and increased his own legitimacy—although staurakios , now somewhere between the ages of 11 and 13 , was not yet old enough to actually exercise power after staurakios elevation to co-emperor , he is not mentioned again in the sources until 807 , when nikephoros decided that staurakios needed to marry , and thus held an imperial bride show to select a wife on 20 december 807 theophano of athens was selected , likely due to the fact that she was a kinswoman of irene , and therefore would help add legitimacy to both nikephoros and staurakios rule staurakios spine had been severed during the battle , which along with staurakios ' demonstrated lack of ability , led the uninjured influential figures in the empire to consider the issue of nikephoros ' successor the severity of staurakios wounds led to speculation as to whether he would live , although eventually they judged he would make the best candidate , as the legitimate successor , and declared him emperor this decision united the chief leaders and officials of the byzantine empire behind michael , as they did not desire to return to the uncertainty which had pervaded irene 's rule , due to her ruling despite being a woman stephanos , after swearing he would not reveal the discussion to anyone else , gathered the remaining tagmatic forces and important officials at the hippodrome of constantinople , where on 2 october michael was proclaimed emperor by the army and senate at dawn staurakios also sent a letter of protest to patriarch nikephoros for his role in the coup d ’ état ; nikephoros answered in person , writing alongside michael and prokopia , and assured staurakios that he had not betrayed him , but rather protected him staurakios reigned only two months and eight days , and was therefore unable to leave a mark on the empire as his father had done both nikephoros and staurakios were generally successful in maintaining the borders of the byzantine empire , although they did not achieve much military success , occasionally being forced to make humiliating concessions to powerful enemies , such as the abbasid caliph harun al-rashid
