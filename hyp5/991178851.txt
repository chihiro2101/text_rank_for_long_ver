in which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error in the sciences , the book laid the foundation for malebranche ’ s philosophical reputation and ideas most importantly , in the third book , which discussed pure understanding , he defended a claim that the ideas through which we perceive objects exist in god in the tenth elucidation , for instance , malebranche introduced his theory of '' intelligible extension '' , a single , archetypal idea of extension into which the ideas of all particular kinds of bodies could be jointly resolved in others , malebranche placed a greater emphasis than he had previously done on his occasionalist account of causation , and particularly on his contention that god acted for the most part through '' general volitions '' and only rarely , as in the case of miracles , through '' particular volitions '' malebranche expanded on this last point in 1680 when he published treatise on nature and grace with regard to this account of intellectual knowledge , malebranche was more or less following saint augustine his great innovation was to explain how these same divine ideas could also serve as the immediate objects of human minds in sensual perception the latter will limit the mind 's apprehension of the former in such a manner as to make it represent a particular individual to that mind to a different mind , one with a different sensation , the same idea could represent a different individual of the same general kind in the dialogues on metaphysics and religion ( dialogue 1 ) , malebranche added that the same basic structure can also account for ( the mental as opposed to the physiological element in ) imagination , in this case where the idea only '' lightly touches '' the mind he is noted particularly for his view that we see all things in god and for his adoption of psycho-physical parallelism and 'occasionalism ' to deal with the problem of interaction between mind and body ( 1 ) if we see all things in god in the sense that he puts the ideas into our minds we can have no direct knowledge of the external world we can appeal to clear and distinct ideas as a criterion for the veridicality of judgements about physical things , but it is god who is ultimately responsible for our ideas ( 2 ) if all things are under the direct control of god , subject to his will , what of human freedom ? malebranche 's view that we have freedom to choose but only in relation to finite goods is not convincing , denying as it does the possibility of resistance of movement towards god as the universal good ( this may be a misrepresentation of malebranche 's view ; see the first chapter of the search for truth , where he specifies that while we can not but desire the good in general , we are free to apply that love to particulars , and can do so in a disordered fashion that leads to sin although he conceded that god had the power to create a more perfect world , free from all defects , such a world would have necessitated a greater complexity in divine ways whereas malebranche followed augustine in his description of intellectual knowledge , in his approach to mind–body problems he began as a follower of descartes but in contrast to descartes , who considered it possible to form a clear and distinct idea of the mind , malebranche argues in the dialogues on metaphysics , a dialogue between theodore and aristes , that we do not have a complete conception of the powers of the mind , and thus no clear conception of the nature of the mind malebranche 's doctrine , which could be found in contemporary commentaries on aristotle , and which first appeared in certain arab philosophers , is therefore called '' occasionalism '' changes occurring in created things will exhibit regularities ( and will thus satisfy a humean definition of causation ) because god in creating the world observes what malebranche calls '' order '' : he binds himself to act according to laws of nature chosen in accordance with his general will that the world be as good as possible , and thus ( for example ) that the laws be simple and few in number in particular , there will be laws governing what we would customarily call the '' interaction '' of body and mind , so that similar movements in the body will '' occasion '' similar ideas in the mind although better known for his philosophical work , malebranche made some notable contributions to physics , working within a broadly cartesian framework but nevertheless prepared to depart from descartes where necessary newton had already developed his position some thirty years earlier , but malebranche probably would not have been aware of it until it was finally published in the opticks of 1704 , or , more likely , in its latin translation of 1706 he was , however , held in widespread high regard within his own lifetime and for some time afterwards , and the influence of certain of his ideas can be discerned in the works of several important figures berkeley , influenced both by bayle and directly by malebranche himself , simply took the final step to a full denial of the existence of material substance in addition , berkeley agreed with malebranche , against descartes , that we could not achieve a clear idea of the mind itself john locke had also argued for this , but he had made no distinction between minds and bodies on this point , whereas both berkeley and malebranche maintained ( each in his own way ) that we could have ideas of bodies but not of minds gottfried leibniz ( who met malebranche in paris in about 1675 and corresponded with him thereafter ) also rejected the vision in god , and his theory of pre-established harmony was designed as a new alternative to occasionalism as well as to the more traditional theory of efficient causal interaction however , in his own theodicy , even if it was somewhat more elaborate than malebranche 's , he did at least agree with malebranche 's fundamental contention that the simplicity of god 's ways had to be given as much regard as the world 's perfection david hume supported and drew upon malebranche 's negative arguments to show that no genuine causal connections could be conceived between distinct mundane entities in a somewhat similar manner , arthur schopenhauer regarded the theory of vision in god as '' explaining something unknown by something even more unknown i , '' sketch of a history of the doctrine of the ideal and the real '' locke withheld his '' an examination of père malebranche 's opinion of seeing all things in god '' from publication , '' because he looked upon it to be an opinion that would not spread but was like to die of itself , or at least to do no great harm several of his works have been translated into english for the first time , as scholars have been reassessing his ideas many have begun to argue that the originality and unity of his philosophical system merits him a place alongside such figures as descartes , spinoza , and leibniz
