meyer and allen 's ( 1991 ) three-component model of commitment was created to argue that commitment has three different components that correspond with different psychological states an employee with greater organizational commitment has a greater chance of contributing to organizational success and will also experience higher levels of job satisfaction they believe the studies should return to the original understanding of organizational commitment as an attitude toward the organization and measure it accordingly it becomes clear that affective commitment equals an attitude toward a target , while continuance and normative commitment are representing different concepts referring to anticipated behavioral outcomes , specifically staying or leaving after their research , sollinger , olffen , and roe believe eagly and chaiken 's attitude-behavior model from 1993 would be a good alternative model to look at as a general organizational commitment predictor because of its approach at organizational commitment as a singular construct , which in turn would help predicting various behaviors beyond turnover job satisfaction is commonly defined as the extent to which employees like their work most research on job satisfaction has been aimed towards the person-environment fit paradigm job satisfaction has been found to be an important area of research because one of the top reasons individuals give for leaving a job is dissatisfaction much of the literature on the relationship between commitment and satisfaction with one 's job indicates that if employees are satisfied they develop stronger commitment to their work kalleberg ( 1990 ) studied work attitudes of workers in the us and japan and found a correlation of 0.73 between job satisfaction and organizational commitment of workers in japan and a higher significant correlation of 0.81 among americans ; perceiving a '' calling '' : a study at the university of florida found a positive correlation between the individual 's perception of their career being a '' calling '' and the level of commitment to the job this study looked at the relation between work commitment and participant 's perception of meaning in their job participants were tested in the areas of ; perceiving a calling , job satisfaction , and job commitment role ambiguity and conflict decrease worker 's performance and are positively related to the probability of the workers leaving the organization the first is structural empowerment which comes from the organizational/management theory and is described as the ability to get things done and to mobilize resources taking cultural context into consideration , the study still showed a positive correlation between empowerment and job satisfaction/commitment the study also found that job satisfaction and organizational commitment were highly correlated with being a permanent worker focused on the impact of the distribution of leadership and leadership support among teachers and how that affected job satisfaction and commitment the study found that there was a strong relationship between organizational commitment and the cohesion of the leadership team and the amount of leadership support this study examined how one leader ( usually a principal ) effected the job satisfaction and commitment of teachers the study found that when leadership was distributed by the 'leader ' out to the teachers as well workers reported higher job satisfaction and organizational commitment than when most of the leadership fell to one person
