interest was also shown by lord montgomerie and william houston who would also benefit from the canal passing through their lands and connecting their own coal and iron mines to nearby industrial consumers contour canals require only a small water supply since no water is lost to locks , but this method of construction would make the canal longer than it need have been the second section would see a series of 8 locks lift the level up to a summit near johnstone the third and last section would use 13 locks to bring the canal down to sea level at ardrossan harbour the full length to glasgow 's port eglinton was complete sometime in 1811 the original plans to extend the canal to ardrossan were soon suspended hugh montgomerie , 12th earl of eglinton , had already spent Â£100,000 on a separate project to build a sea harbour at ardrossan , at the proposed terminus of the canal attempts were made to raise extra funds but other major investors , such as william houston , were reluctant to invest as the canal already linked his own coal and iron mines , around johnstone , to glasgow and paisley the boats reached speeds of , and although 14 journeys were made each day , no damage was caused to the canal banks by their wash many people , with the day off work , took the opportunity to travel the short distance of by canal between paisley and johnstone freight also made a significant part of the traffic on the canal parliament dictated that due to the failure to complete the canal past johnstone , that work on the railway should be started at the ardrossan harbour end the canal continued to compete with the railways for many decades , but in 1869 , was purchased by the glasgow and south western railway company ( the successor to gpk & a ) much of the route was used to construct the paisley canal railway line they raised further capital and started building the railway from ardrossan ; reaching kilwinning before running out of money in the 1830s they planned to turn their canal into a railway and complete the link from kilwinning to johnstone ; but allowed the scheme to fold in the 1840s they split off their railway to form a separate company , the ardrossan railway , and transferred their debt to the new company much of the route was used to construct the paisley canal line this makes the former aqueduct the world 's oldest railway bridge that is still in active use short sections of the original canal can still be seen at the millarston and ferguslie mills area of paisley
