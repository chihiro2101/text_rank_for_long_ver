it is used as a general method to identify the presence of a specific single protein within a complex mixture of proteins in addition , applying a dilution series of a purified protein of known concentrations can be used to allow a more precise estimate of protein concentration then , the serum to be tested is applied in the primary antibody incubation step ; free antibody is washed away , and a secondary anti-human antibody linked to an enzyme signal is added blood doping is the misuse of certain techniques and/or substances to increase one 's red blood cell mass , which allows the body to transport more oxygen to muscles and therefore increase stamina and performance sds is generally used as a buffer ( as well as in the gel ) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge , since proteins can be positively , negatively , or neutrally charged following electrophoretic separation , the proteins are transferred to a membrane ( typically nitrocellulose or pvdf ) , where they are blocked with milk ( or other blocking agents ) to prevent non-specific antibody binding , and then stained with antibody specific to the target protein lastly , the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining , which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods it is also possible to use a two-dimensional gel which spreads the proteins from a single sample out in two dimensions the most commonly used method for transferring the proteins is called electroblotting as a result of either transfer process , the proteins are exposed on a thin membrane layer for detection total protein staining allows the total protein that has been successfully transferred to the membrane to be visualised , allowing the user to check the uniformity of protein transfer and to perform subsequent normalization of the target protein with the actual protein amount per lane normalization with the so-called '' loading control '' was based on immunostaining of housekeeping proteins in the classical procedure , but is heading toward total protein staining recently , due to multiple benefits in order to avoid noise of signal , total protein staining should be performed before blocking of the membrane since the membrane has been chosen for its ability to bind protein and as both antibodies and the target are proteins , steps must be taken to prevent the interactions between the membrane and the antibody used for detection of the target protein thus , when the antibody is added , it can not bind to the membrane , and therefore the only available binding site is the specific target protein during the detection process the membrane is '' probed '' for the protein of interest with a modified antibody which is linked to a reporter enzyme ; when exposed to an appropriate substrate , this enzyme drives a colorimetric reaction and produces a color the primary antibody are generated when a host species or immune cell culture is exposed to the protein of interest ( or a part thereof ) normally , this is part of the immune response , whereas here they are harvested and used as sensitive and specific detection tools that bind the protein directly it can also be incubated at different temperatures , with lesser temperatures being associated with more binding , both specific ( to the target protein , the '' signal '' ) and non-specific ( '' noise '' ) this means that several secondary antibodies will bind to one primary antibody and enhance the signal , allowing the detection of proteins of a much lower concentration than would be visible by sds-page alone therefore , the production of luminescence is proportional to the amount of hrp-conjugated secondary antibody , and therefore , indirectly measures the presence of the target protein as with the elispot and elisa procedures , the enzyme can be provided with a substrate molecule that will be converted by the enzyme to a colored reaction product that will be visible on the membrane ( see the figure below with blue bands ) proteins can be accurately quantified because the signal generated by the different amounts of proteins on the membranes is measured in a static state , as compared to chemiluminescence , in which light is measured in a dynamic state this requires a probe antibody which both recognizes the protein of interest and contains a detectable label , probes which are often available for known protein tags the primary probe is incubated with the membrane in a manner similar to that for the primary antibody in a two-step process , and then is ready for direct detection after a series of wash steps the amount of target protein is normalized to the structural protein to control between groups radioactive labels do not require enzyme substrates , but rather , allow the placement of medical x-ray film directly against the western blot , which develops as it is exposed to the label and creates dark regions which correspond to the protein bands of interest ( see image above ) one major difference between nitrocellulose and pvdf membranes relates to the ability of each to support '' stripping '' antibodies off and reusing the membrane for subsequent antibody probes in principle , this method allows for the separation of all cellular proteins on a single large gel
