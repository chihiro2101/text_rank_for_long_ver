her early death , when xenakis was five years old , was a traumatic experience that , in his own words , '' deeply scarred '' the future composer although he intended to study architecture and engineering , he also took lessons in harmony and counterpoint with aristotelis koundouroff xenakis joined the national liberation front early during the war , participating in mass protests and demonstrations , and later becoming part of armed resistance—this last step was a painful experience xenakis refused to discuss until much later in life in a late interview , xenakis admitted to feeling tremendous guilt at leaving his country , and that guilt was one of the sources of his later devotion to music : for years i was tormented by guilt at having left the country for which i 'd fought although he was an illegal immigrant in paris , xenakis was able to get a job at le corbusier 's architectural studio he worked as engineering assistant at first , but quickly rose to performing more important tasks , and eventually to collaborating with le corbusier on major projects hoffmann the experience xenakis gained played a major role in his music : important early compositions such as metastaseis ( 1953–54 ) were based directly on architectural concepts xenakis , who was by that time well acquainted with music of debussy , béla bartók , and stravinsky , all of whom used such devices and much more experimental ones , was furious and left to study with darius milhaud , but these lessons also proved fruitless xenakis approached messiaen for advice : should he once again start studying harmony and counterpoint ? messiaen later recalled : i understood straight away that he was not someone like the others no , you are almost thirty , you have the good fortune of being greek , of being an architect and having studied special mathematics xenakis 's compositions from 1949–52 were mostly inspired by greek folk melodies , as well as bartók , ravel , and others ; after studying with messiaen , he discovered serialism and gained a deep understanding of contemporary music ( messiaen 's other pupils at the time included , for example , karlheinz stockhausen and jean barraqué ) the third part of the triptych , metastaseis , is generally regarded as the composer 's first mature piece ; it was detached from the triptych to mark the beginning of the '' official '' xenakis oeuvre although scherchen did not premiere that particular work , he did give performances of later pieces by xenakis , and the relationship between the conductor and the composer was of vital importance for the latter by the late 1950s xenakis slowly started gaining recognition in artistic circles after leaving le corbusier 's studio in 1959 , xenakis supported himself by composition and teaching , and quickly became recognized as one of the most important european composers of his time in addition to composing and teaching , xenakis also wrote a number of articles and essays on music a collection of texts on applications of stochastic processes , game theory and computer programming in music , it was later revised , expanded and translated into english as formalized music : thought and mathematics in composition ( 1971 ) during xenakis 's tenure at indiana university i would like to propose what , to my mind , covers the term '' music '' : & nbsp ; formalized music : thought and mathematics in composition , second edition in 1999 , xenakis was awarded the polar music prize '' for a long succession of forceful works , charged with sensitivity , commitment and passion , through which he has come to rank among the most central composers of our century in the realm of art music , exercising within its various fields an influence which can not be readily overstated '' polar music prize website ( accessed 29 april 2016 ) after several years of serious illness , on 1 february 2001 the composer lapsed into a coma although electroacoustic compositions represent only a small fraction of xenakis 's output , they are highly relevant to musical thinking in the late 20th century despite xenakis 's reputation as a '' mathematical '' composer , his works are known for their power and physicality '' service described xenakis as a composer '' whose craggily , joyously elemental music turned collections of pitches and rhythms and instruments into a force of nature , releasing a power that previous composers had only suggested metaphorically but which he would realise with arguably greater clarity , ferocity , intensity than any musician , before or since , '' and suggested that his music is '' expressive : not in a conventionally emotional way , perhaps , but it has an ecstatic , cathartic power xenakis 's music – and its preternaturally brilliant performers - allows its listeners to witness seismic events close at hand , to be at the middle of a musical happening of cosmic intensity '' service concluded : '' it took xenakis for music to become nature formalized music : thought and mathematics in composition ( harmonologia series no.6 )
