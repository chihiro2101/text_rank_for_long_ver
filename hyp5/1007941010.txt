herbert characterized the situation thus : '' if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid-ocean and confronted by the riachuelo it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the american flag would get into port '' the navy advisory board , confronted with the possibility of hostile ironclads operating off the american coast , began planning for a pair of ships to protect that coast in 1884 they were both optimized for end-on fire and had their gun turrets sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow them to fire across the deck , much like the battleships riachuelo and the first ship , laid down for the then-traditional cruiser mission of battleship substitute on overseas deployment and armed with four guns , became the other , armed with two guns , became texas , the first ship named in honor of that state to be built by the united states the need for cross-deck fire caused the superstructure to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the superstructure this significantly limited the gun 's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun 's arc of fire furthermore , neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired , as demonstrated during the battle of santiago de cuba when her starboard deck was damaged even five years before texas was complete , the blast effects from end-on fire were considered prohibitive and en echelon mounting of main guns was abandoned in european navies the then-new board on construction considered a thorough re-design which would have placed texass main guns on the centerline , either in two single turrets or one twin turret , and the heavy redoubt eliminated initially , they could only be loaded at one positions , dead-ahead and at 0° elevation , but they were modified to load at all angles of train just before the start of the spanish–american war texas carried four torpedo tubes , all above water she was originally intended to carry two small steam torpedo boats , each with a one-pounder gun , and a trainable torpedo tube , but they were cancelled after the poor performance of the boat built for the maine along the center of the ship , they were one inch thick , but increased to two inches closer to the sides of the ship no light armor was fitted above the main belt or at either end of the ship when drydocked in the new york navy yard for the first time after her trials several structural flaws came to light the board determined that further strengthening of her hull was needed , but the exact measures taken are not known , although they would cost 39,450 and take 100 working days late the next day she was hauled off by the use of her port anchor and a tug the next day the texas landed three field pieces and two m1895 colt–browning machine guns at the request of the marine expeditionary commander , lt the two ships opened fire just after 14:00 and ceased fire about an hour and 16 & nbsp ; minutes later , having reduced the fort to impotency texas took four of the enemy ships under fire immediately '' the two spanish destroyers fell out of the action quickly and beached themselves , damaged heavily one by one , the larger enemy warships also succumbed to the combined fire of the american fleet '' texas was lightly damaged during the battle by a single high explosive shell that hit her on the starboard side above the main deck , immediately forward of the ash hoist by 1910 , she had lost her revolving cannon and one more one-pdr gun in exchange for two additional six-pounder guns as part of this evaluation , she was fully fitted out and only items which normally would have been allowed to be removed before action and those items added to her for service as a station ship were removed no detailed examination was made afterward , but it was noted that there were so many holes below the waterline that the water in the forward and rear compartments generally took on the motion of the outside water '' a cage mast , a duplicate of those used on the dreadnoughts , was built atop the san marcoss remains in 1912 and tested against shells fired by the monitor from a range of on 21 august 1912 although the mast had been knocked down by nine hits , it was considered to have withstood the fire exceedingly well san marcos was used for gunnery practice throughout world war ii , although generally as an anchor for a canvas target screen sitting two to six feet below the surface and marked by an unlit buoy , she was responsible for the sinking of the cargo ship lexington in 1940 following a collision tons of explosives were used to demolish her upperworks and drive her hull deep into the mud ; by january 1959 , they were successful and she remains there today
