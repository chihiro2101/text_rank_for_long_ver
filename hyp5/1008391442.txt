however , mordred 's later characterisation as the king 's villainous son has a precedent in the figure of amhar , a son of arthur 's known from only two references the unhistorical account presented by geoffrey describes arthur leaving modredus in charge of his throne as he crossed the english channel to wage war on lucius tiberius of rome in another , he is described as the author of one of the '' three unrestrained ravagings of the isle of britain '' â€“ he came to arthur 's court at kelliwic in cornwall , devoured all of the food and drink , and even dragged gwenhwyfar ( guinevere ) from her throne and beat her in the revision known as the post-vulgate cycle , and consequently in thomas malory 's english compilation le morte d'arthur ( the death of arthur ) , arthur is told prophecy by merlin about a just-born child that is to be his undoing , and so he tries to avert the fate by ordering the killing of all the may day newborns this episode ( reminiscent of the biblical massacre of the innocents and sometimes dubbed the '' may day massacre '' ) leads to a war between arthur and the furious king lot , believing he was mordred 's father , in which the latter king dies at the hands of arthur 's vassal king pellinore in this branch of the legend , the young mordred later joins arthur 's fellowship of the round table after merlin 's downfall he also becomes the killer of pellinore 's son lamorak , as well as a friend and companion of the great knight lancelot the latter comes to rescue to the young mordred on multiple occasions in the prose lancelot , such as helping save his life at the castle of the white thorn ( castel de la blanche espine ) , and mordred in turn treats lancelot as his personal hero his turning point toward villainy is hearing an old priest 's prophecy for him and lancelot , the two '' most unfortunate knights '' , revealing his true parentage and predicting their roles in the ruin of the kingdom the prose lancelot indicates mordred was about 22 years old at the time ( two years into his knighthood ) mordred eventually overthrows arthur 's rule when the latter is engaged in the war against lancelot ( or during the second roman war that followed it , depending on the version ) the text adds that '' there was much good in mordred , and as soon as he made himself elevated go the throne , he made himself well beloved by all , '' and so they were '' ready to die to defend his honor '' once arthur returned with his army medraut is never considered arthur 's son in welsh texts , only his nephew , though the dream of rhonabwy mentions that the king had been his foster father in early literature derived from geoffrey 's historia , mordred was considered the legitimate son of arthur 's sister or half-sister queen variably known as morgause with her husband , king lot , the king of either lothian or orkney today , however , he is best known as arthur 's own illegitimate son by morgause in the motif introduced in the vulgate cycle , in which their union happens at the time when neither of them have yet known of their blood relation in stark contrast to many modern works , mordred 's only interaction with morgan le fay in any medieval text occurs when he and his brothers visit morgan 's castle in the vulgate queste , in which she is mordred 's aunt according to boece , arthur agreed to make mordred his heir but then , on the advice of the britons who did not want mordred to rule , he made constantine his heir ; this led to the war in which arthur and mordred die however , in later writings like the lancelot-grail cycle and le morte d'arthur , guinevere is not treated as a traitor and instead she flees mordred 's proposal and hides in the tower of london another late welsh tradition was that medrawd 's wife was gwenhwyfach , sister of gwenhwyfar in henry of huntingdon 's retelling of geoffrey 's historia , mordred is beheaded at camlann in a lone charge against him and his entire host by arthur himself , who suffers many injuries in the process these and many other versions of the legend feature the motif of arthur and mordred striking down each other in a duel after most of the others on both sides have died malory 's telling is a variant of the original account from the vulgate mort artu , in which arthur and mordred both charge at each other on horses three times until arthur drives his lance through mordred 's body , but then fully withdraws it ( a ray of sunlight even shines through the hole ) before mordred 's sword powerfully strikes his head and they both fall from their saddles however , mordred 's two sons and their saxon allies later rise against him geoffrey 's account of the episode may be based on constantine 's murder of two '' royal youths '' as mentioned by the 6th-century writer gildas even malory , who depicts mordred as a villain , notes that the people rallied to him because , '' with arthur was none other life but war and strife , and with sir mordred was great joy and bliss
