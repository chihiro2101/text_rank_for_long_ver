the relative ion size requirements for stability of the cubic structure are quite stringent , so slight buckling and distortion can produce several lower-symmetry distorted versions , in which the coordination numbers of a cations , b cations or both are reduced different forms of intrusions , based on the chemical makeup of the intrusion , are defined as : aurivillius phase : the intruding layer is composed of a 2+ ion , occurring every n layers , leading to an overall chemical formula of - dion−jacobson phase : the intruding layer is composed of an alkali metal ( m ) every n layers , giving the overall formula as ruddlesden-popper phase : the simplest of the phases , the intruding layer occurs between every one ( n 1 ) or two ( n 2 ) layers of the lattice ruddlesden−popper phases have a similar relationship to perovskites in terms of atomic radii of elements with a typically being large ( such as la or sr ) with the b ion being much smaller typically a transition metal ( such as mn , co or ni ) the well-defined and unique structures at the interfaces between the film and substrate can be used for interface engineering , where new types properties can arise an example of this is laalo 3 grown on srtio 3 , where the interface can exhibit conductivity , even though both laalo 3 and srtio 3 is non-conductive the perovskite structure is adopted at high pressure by bridgmanite , a silicate with the formula ( mg , fe ) sio 3 , which is the most common mineral in the earth 's mantle at the pressure and temperature conditions of the lower mantle , the second most abundant material is likely the rock-salt structure ( mg , fe ) o oxide , periclase a large family of metallic perovskite compounds can be represented by rt 3 m ( r : rare-earth or other relatively large ion , t : transition metal ion and m : light metalloids ) mgcni 3 is a metallic perovskite compound and has received lot of attention because of its superconducting properties colossal magnetoresistance , ferroelectricity , superconductivity , charge ordering , spin dependent transport , high thermopower and the interplay of structural , magnetic and transport properties are commonly observed features in this family they are also some interests for scintillator as they have large light yield for radiation conversion synthetic perovskites have been identified as possible inexpensive base materials for high-efficiency commercial photovoltaics – they showed a conversion efficiency of up to 25.5 % reported in 2020 by nrel and can be manufactured using the same thin-film manufacturing techniques as that used for thin film silicon solar cells described nanostructured cells using a mixed methylammonium lead halide ( ch 3 nh 3 pbi 3−x cl x ) and demonstrated one amorphous thin-film solar cell with an 11.4 % conversion efficiency , and another that reached 15.4 % using vacuum evaporation they also showed that carrier lifetimes in the mixed perovskite are longer than in the pure iodide this technique produces 15 % solar-to-electrical power conversion as measured under simulated full sunlight although the stability of perovskite leds is not yet as good as iii-v or organic leds , there are plenty of ongoing research to solve this problem , such as incorporating organic molecules or potassium dopants in perovskite leds the main property of those crystals is a large mass density of 8.4 g/cm 3 , which gives short x- and gamma-ray absorption length those properties made luap : ce scintillators attractive for commercials and they were used quite often in high energy physics experiments
