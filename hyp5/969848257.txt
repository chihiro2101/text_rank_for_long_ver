although nectocaris is known from canada , china and australia , in rocks spanning some 20 & nbsp ; million years , there does not seem to be much diversity ; size excepted , all specimens are anatomically very similar & nbsp ; pteryx , there seem to be two discrete morphs , one large ( ~10 & nbsp ; cm in length ) , one small ( ~3 & nbsp ; cm long ) the unusual shape of the nectocaridid funnel has led to its interpretation as an eversible proboscis , but this is difficult to reconcile with the fossil evidence the most pleasing interpretation – which is not without problems – is to interpret some of the features of nectocaris as shared with the earliest cephalopods features that seem to be shared with the modern coleoids ( which evolved much later ) can then be attributed to convergence – but perhaps using the same underlying genetic machinery as modern coleoids do today because the genus was originally known from a single , incomplete specimen and with no counterpart , conway morris was unable to deduce its affinity the structure previous researchers had identified as an oval carapace or shield behind the eyes was suggested to be a soft funnel , similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods the interpretation would push back the origin of cephalopods by at least 30 & nbsp ; million years , much closer to the first appearance of complex animals , in the cambrian explosion , and implied that & ndash ; against the widespread expectation & ndash ; cephalopods evolved from non-mineralized ancestors whether nectocaris represents a derived or basal cephalopod , and whether it belongs in the crown group , it is more parsimonious to interpret its distinctive features as homologues of their equivalent in cephalopods – even if the absence of a shell in nectocaris is an independent feature it was later considered an arthropod , and in 2010 smith and caron , agreeing that petalilium was at least a close relative of vetustovermis ( but that treating it as a synonym was premature , given the poor preservation of the vetustovermis type ) , placed it with nectocaris in the clade nectocarididae
