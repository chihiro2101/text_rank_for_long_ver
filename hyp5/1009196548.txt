the biological toxicity of pathogens can be difficult to measure because the '' threshold dose '' may be a single organism because individuals typically have different levels of response to the same dose of a toxic substance , a population-level measure of toxicity is often used which relates the probabilities of an outcome for a given individual in a population when such data does not exist , estimates are made by comparison to known similar toxic things , or to similar exposures in similar organisms for example , if a dose of a toxic substance is safe for a laboratory rat , one might assume that one-tenth that dose would be safe for a human , allowing a safety factor of 10 to allow for interspecies differences between two mammals ; if the data are from fish , one might use a factor of 100 to account for the greater difference between two chordate classes ( fish and mammals ) similarly , an extra protection factor may be used for individuals believed to be more susceptible to toxic effects such as in pregnancy or with certain diseases or , a newly synthesized and previously unstudied chemical that is believed to be very similar in effect to another compound could be assigned an additional protection factor of 10 to account for possible differences in effects that are probably much smaller assessing all aspects of the toxicity of cancer-causing agents involves additional issues , since it is not certain if there is a minimal effective dose for carcinogens , or whether the risk is just too small to see it is more difficult to determine the toxicity of chemical mixtures than a pure chemical because each component displays its own toxicity , and components may interact to produce enhanced or diminished effects the types of toxicities where substances may cause lethality to the entire body , lethality to specific organs , major/minor damage , or cause cancer
