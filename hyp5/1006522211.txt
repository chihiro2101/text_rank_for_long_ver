navy ships often use signal lamps and morse code in a similar way aviator often use visual approach slope indicator ( vasi ) projected light systems to land safely , especially at night as well , airport control towers still use aldis lamps to transmit instructions to aircraft whose radios have failed information is encoded by the position of the mechanical elements ; it is read when the shutter is in a fixed position they were far faster than post riders for conveying a message over long distances , but far more expensive and less private than the electrical telegraph lines which would later replace them the maximum distance that a pair of semaphore telegraph stations can bridge is limited by geography , weather and the availability of light ; thus , in practical use , most optical telegraphs used lines of relay stations to bridge longer distances each relay station would also require its complement of skilled operator-observers to convey messages back and forth across the line many national services adopted signaling systems different from the chappe system these systems were popular in the late 18th to early 19th century but could not compete with the electrical telegraph , and went completely out of service by 1880 in large versions this pulse is achieved by opening and closing shutters mounted in front of the lamp , either via a manually operated pressure switch or , in later versions , automatically the lamps are usually equipped with some form of optical sight , and are most commonly deployed on naval vessels and also used in airport control towers with coded aviation light signals aviation light signals are used in the case of a nordo , an aircraft not equipped with a radio , or in the case of a hearing-impaired pilot these colors may be flashing or steady , and provide different instructions to aircraft in flight or on the ground ( for example , '' cleared to land '' or '' cleared for takeoff '' ) only 12 simple standardized instructions are directed at aircraft using signal light guns as the system is not utilized with morse code in the present day a variety of electronic systems optically transmit and receive information carried by pulses of light fiber-optic communication cables are now employed to send the great majority of the electronic data and long distance telephone calls that are not conveyed by either radio , terrestrial microwave or satellite free-space optical communications are also used every day in various applications the photophone ( originally given an alternate name , radiophone ) is a communication device which allowed for the transmission of speech on a beam of light on june 21 , 1880 , bell 's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message of considerable distance , from the roof of the franklin school to the window of bell 's laboratory , some 213 meters ( about 700 & nbsp ; ft ) away free-space optics ( fso ) systems are employed for 'last mile ' telecommunications and can function over distances of several kilometers as long as there is a clear line of sight between the source and the destination , and the optical receiver can reliably decode the transmitted information
