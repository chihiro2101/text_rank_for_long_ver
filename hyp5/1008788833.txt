prior to the actual construction of the navigation , there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme , and opposition from the port of maldon , which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to chelmsford in july 1733 , john hore , who was involved in the kennet , stroudwater , and the avon navigation at bristol , proposed two schemes , one to make the river navigable , and another to create a new cut between chelmsford and maldon despite the projected extra costs for a canal , hore favoured the canal scheme , as he believed there would be less objection from the millers along the river route work continued on the navigation , with the first section from heybridge basin to little baddow opening in april 1796 and the navigation opening throughout on 3 june 1797 an additional stop lock protected the new cut from flooding at beeleigh further improvements were made , including the rebuilding of heybridge sea lock by james green , and trade developed steadily although commercial traffic ceased , the navigation continued to derive income from water abstraction and from the sale of wood from the willows which grow along the banks '' the construction of housing and restaurants around the springfield basin site took place , including coates quay and waterfront place , which meant that the basin became accessible to the public for the first time , and lockside marina was built just above springfield lock access to the navigation from the river blackwater is only possible at certain states of the tide , and advance booking to use the sea lock is required the cut would avoid a weir and low bridge to rejoin the river system where the river can and chelmer merge , and a new waterside area would be constructed in the town centre the link was downgraded to an '' aspiration '' following a 2008 planning enquiry , although it remained on the town centre development plans , and the replacement essex record office building was sited so that it would overlook the link the link ceased to be a favoured option in 2020 , after decisions to build a new link road between parkway and the site of the old gas works , which was being redeveloped as housing navigation is prevented by a large weir structure , which was installed in the 1960s as part of a flood defence scheme its principal function is to maintain water levels in the rivers within the city , which would otherwise become muddy ditches at some times of the year since 1995 , it had been maintained by the environment agency , but they decided that they could no longer justify the costs of maintaining the structure , which consists of two radial gates at either side of a central tilting gate , with a control building on the north bank of the river chelmsford city council commissioned a feasibility study , which proposed that the automatic gates could be replaced , and a navigation lock built alongside the new structure , on the north side of the river much of the maintenance is carried out by local volunteers as well as volunteers from waterway recovery group , which is also part of the iwa regular working parties help to keep the waterway , including the towpath , locks and other structures well maintained , and many of the recent improvements have been undertaken by the volunteers in february 2016 , the two groups worked together to upgrade of towpath near papermill lock , where a section of muddy towpath was given an all-weather surface by using 150 tons of road planings its maintenance is unusual , in that the northumbrian water group has a statutory obligation to maintain the mitre gates and the sea gate at the eastern end of the lock when the hanningfield water order 1950 was passed by parliament , it included a clause that made the water companies responsible for the lock gates , because water from the navigation would be pumped to the reservoir , and they needed to esnure that it would not become contaminated with salt this arrangement was modified by the chelmer navigation agreement 1964 , which moved the responsibility for carrying out repairs to the chelmer and blackwater company , but required the water companies to fund the work once its extent was agreed the new gate would incorporate a number of improvements over the old
