many period 6 transition metals are very valuable , such as gold , however many period 6 other metals are incredibly toxic , such as thallium for example , a radioactive isotope lutetium-176 is used in nuclear technology to determine the age of meteorites lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions hafnium 's large neutron capture cross-section makes it a good material for neutron absorption in control rods in nuclear power plants , but at the same time requires that it be removed from the neutron-transparent corrosion-resistant zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors it is part of the refractory metals group , which are widely used as minor component in alloys tungsten , also known as wolfram , is a chemical element with the chemical symbol w and atomic number 74 a hard , rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined , tungsten is found naturally on earth only in chemical compounds it was identified as a new element in 1781 , and first isolated as a metal in 1783 the free element is remarkable for its robustness , especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the non-alloyed metals and the second highest of all the elements after carbon tungsten with minor amounts of impurities is often brittle and hard , making it difficult to work the unalloyed elemental form is used mainly in electrical applications tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules , where it is used in a few species of bacteria it is the heaviest element known to be used by any living organism discovered in 1925 , rhenium was the last stable element to be discovered it is a hard , brittle , blue-gray or blue-black transition metal in the platinum family and is the densest naturally occurring element , with a density of ( slightly greater than that of iridium and twice that of lead ) it is found in nature as an alloy , mostly in platinum ores ; its alloys with platinum , iridium , and other platinum group metals are employed in fountain pen tips , electrical contacts , and other applications where extreme durability and hardness are needed a very hard , brittle , silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group , iridium is the second-density element ( after osmium ) and is the most corrosion-resistant metal , even at temperatures as high as 2000 & nbsp ; Â°c iridium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust , with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes and are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium as well as the only stable isotopes ; the latter is the more abundant of the two the most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine , though iridium also forms a number of organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis , and in research it is thought that the total amount of iridium in the planet earth is much higher than that observed in crustal rocks , but as with other platinum group metals , the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten it exhibits a remarkable resistance to corrosion , even at high temperatures , and as such is considered a noble metal being a heavy metal , it leads to health issues upon exposure to its salts , but due to its corrosion resistance , it is not as toxic as some metals chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element it is one of the least reactive chemical elements solid under standard conditions less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , usually with tellurium gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to confirm the presence of gold in items , giving rise to the term the acid test its high malleability , ductility , resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions , and conductivity of electricity led to many uses of gold , including electric wiring , colored-glass production and even gold leaf eating it is also known as quicksilver or hydrargyrum ( mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar ( mercuric sulfide ) lead has the highest atomic number of all of the stable elements , although the next higher element , bismuth , has a half-life that is so long ( much longer than the age of the universe ) that it can be considered stable like the element mercury , another heavy metal , lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates both in soft tissues and the bones elemental bismuth may occur naturally uncombined , although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores bismuth metal has been known from ancient times , although until the 18th century it was often confused with lead and tin , which each have some of the metal 's bulk physical properties bismuth has classically been considered to be the heaviest naturally occurring stable element , in terms of atomic mass as the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years , alloy uses for bismuth metal ( presently about a third of bismuth production ) , as a replacement for lead , have become an increasing part of bismuth 's commercial importance it occurs on the earth only as the result of decay of heavier elements , and decays away rapidly , so much less is known about this element than its upper neighbors in the periodic table earlier studies have shown this element follows periodic trends , being the heaviest known halogen , with melting and boiling points being higher than those of lighter halogens until recently most of the chemical characteristics of astatine were inferred from comparison with other elements ; however , important studies have already been done the second longest-living astatine-211 is the only one to find a commercial use , being useful as an alpha decay in medicine ; however , only extremely small quantities are used , and in larger ones it is very hazardous , as it is intensely radioactive three years later , it was found in nature ; however , with an estimated amount of less than 28 & nbsp ; grams ( 1 & nbsp ; oz ) at given time , astatine is the least abundant element in earth 's crust among non-transuranium elements among astatine isotopes , six ( with mass numbers 214 to 219 ) are present in nature as the result of decay of heavier elements ; however , the most stable astatine-210 and the industrially used astatine-211 are not most of the period 6 elements are toxic ( for instance lead ) and produce heavy-element poisoning
