gauquelin 's work was not limited to the mars effect : his calculations led him first to reject most of the conventions of natal astrology as it is practised in the modern west but he singled out '' highly significant statistical correlations between planetary positions and the birth times of eminently successful people however , partly because eminence in sport is more quantifiable , later research , publicity and controversy has tended to single out the '' mars effect '' the committee , suspecting that the results might have been an artifact , withheld its findings for a further eight years , then cited unspecified “ demography errors ” in its findings in 1983 abell , kurtz and zelen ( see below ) published a reappraisal , rejecting the idea of demographic errors , saying , “ gauquelin adequately allowed for demographic and astronomical factors in predicting the expected distribution of mars sectors for birth times in the general population then professor marvin zelen , a statistician and associate of the recently founded committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal ( csicop , now known as the committee for skeptical inquiry ( csi ) ) , proposed in a 1976 article in the same periodical that , in order to eliminate any demographic anomaly , gauquelin randomly pick 100 athletes from his data-set of 2,088 and check the birth/planet correlations of a sample of babies born at the same times and places in order to establish a control group , giving the base-rate ( chance ) expectation for comparison ( the 100 random athletes later expanded into a subsample of 303 athletes ) the gauquelins also performed the test that professor zelen had proposed and carried out and found that the chance mars-in-key-sector expectation for the general population ( i.e however the subsequent article by zelen , abell and kurtz did not clearly state this outcome but rather questioned the original data in 1990 the cfepp had issued a preliminary report on the study , which used 1,066 french sports champions , giving full data for the 1,066 as well as the names of 373 who fit the criteria but for whom birth times were unavailable , discussing methodology and listing data-selection criteria nienhuys and several letters from gauquelin to the committee , was published in book form as the mars effect – a french test of over 1,000 sports champions the cfepp stated that its experiment showed no effect and concluded that the effect was attributable to bias in gauquelin ’ s data selection , pointing to the suggestions made by gauquelin to the committee for changes in their list of athletes some researchers argued that gauquelin did not adjust the statistical significance of the mars effect for multiple comparisons and did not address the issue in his publications there is about a 25 % chance to find at least one such combination ( of one planet and two sectors ) for a random dataset of the same size as gauquelin ’ s that would yield a result with apparent statistical significance like the one obtained by gauquelin geoffrey dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by gauquelin scientific skepticism outliers ( book ) - offers a simple explanation to a specific known relationship between season of birth and success in canadian hockey leagues
