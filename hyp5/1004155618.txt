in most models , the voter casts two votes : one for a constituency representative and one for a party in the original variant used in germany , citizens gave only one vote , so that voting for a representative automatically meant also voting for the representative 's party in most jurisdictions , candidates may stand for both a constituency and on a party list ( referred to in new zealand as dual candidacy ) , but in wales are restricted to contend either for a constituency or for a party list , but not both in bavaria , the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party 's regional list : bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose in contrast , the open list method of mmp was chosen in november 2016 by voters in the 2016 prince edward island electoral reform referendum in baden-württemberg , there are no lists ; they use the '' best near-winner '' method in a four-region model , where the regional members are the local candidates of the under-represented party in that region who received the most votes in their local constituency without being elected in it above the constituency level ) several different calculation methods have been used , but the basic characteristic of the mmp is that the total number of seats in the assembly , including the single-member seats and not only the party-list ones , are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes the party received in the party portion of the ballot in one election in scotland , the highest averages method resulted in a majority government for the scottish national party with only 44 % of the party vote in the german state of bavaria , the constituency vote and party vote are combined to determine the distribution of seats for example , in the 2008 new zealand general election the māori party won 2.4 % of the party vote , which would entitle them to 0 seats in the house , but won 5 constituency seats , leaving an overhang of 2 seats , which resulted in a 122-member house as in numerous party-list , in order to be eligible for list seats in many mmp models , a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote , or no candidates will be elected from the party list new zealand adopted the system for its unicameral house of representatives in 1994 following a long electoral reform process , beginning with the royal commission on the electoral system in 1985 and ending with the 1993 referendum on the voting system the system 's use was reviewed by referendum in november 2011 , with the majority ( 56.17 % ) voting to keep it in 2020 general election , the labour party won 65 out of 120 seats , becoming the second party under mmp worldwide to be able to govern alone unlike the other two assemblies that use the system , parties have to pass a threshold of 5 % of the regional votes in order to be eligible for the list seats venezuela mmp was previously used for elections , but the link between list and constituency representatives was removed in 2009 in 2007 , the citizens ' assembly on electoral reform in ontario , canada , also recommended the use of mmp in future elections to the legislative assembly of ontario , with a ballot similar to new zealand 's , and with the closed province-wide lists used in new zealand but with only 30 % compensatory members in june 2016 , the canadian house of commons special committee on electoral reform was formed to examine potential changes to the voting system with mmp being one of the options examined in a non-binding plebiscite between 27 october and 7 november 2016 , prince edward islanders voted for mmp over fptp in the final round of counting , 52 % –43 % ; however , the provincial government , despite having set no voter turnout threshold , subsequently claimed that the 36 percent turnout was insufficient to change the electoral system during october–december 2018 , british columbia held a referendum on proportional representation , promised as part of the election platform of the bc ndp who took office following the may 2017 provincial election if pr had been successful on the first question , mmp would have been adopted in time for the next provincial election and would have been subject to a second referendum after two election cycles currently costa rica is debating the switch from the current closed party list proportional representation system to a mixed member proportional representation based on the german model the bill presented by the citizen power now movement and endorsed by the majority of parliamentary groups would create two types of deputies ; 42 elected proportionally by lists presented by the political parties and would be called '' national '' deputies , whilst another 42 deputies would be elected directly by population-based electoral districts on a first pass the post basis as the bill requires a constitutional reform it would require a two-thirds majority of votes , however as of 2019 the caucuses of the four main parties support the reform parliament 's high level panel report of 2017 , chaired by former president kgalema motlanthe , validated the van zyl slabbert mixed-system and recommended its adoption , stating : '' such a system will serve to limit the power of individual party leaders and encourage mps to vote in accordance with the needs and desires of their constituencies rather than only following party lines '' similarly , in new zealand , some voters who preferred a large party have voted for the minor party 's local candidate to ensure it qualifies for list seats on the back of winning a single electorate in this case the tactic maintained some proportionality by bypassing the 5 % threshold , but is largely disfavoured by the public due to it awarding smaller parties extra list seats while parties with a higher party vote percentage that do n't win an electorate receive no seats ; this occurred in 2008 when act was awarded 5 seats on the back of one electorate seat and 3.7 % of the party vote , while new zealand first with no electorate seats and 4.1 % of the party vote were awarded none some voters may therefore seek to achieve double representation by voting tactically for another party in the regional vote , as a vote for their preferred party in the regional vote would be wasted by way of example , in 2005 albanian parliamentary election , the two main parties did not expect to win any list seats , so they encouraged voters to use their list votes for allied minor parties in an abusive gambit similar to that used in albania , major parties feeling that they are unlikely to win a large number of list seats because of their advantage at the constituency level might choose to split their party in two , with one subdivision of the party contesting the constituency seats , while the other contests the list seats —assuming this is allowed by electoral law the tactic was later adopted by pro-chavez parties at the national level in 2005 another example is that of the 2001 italian general election , in which one of the two main coalitions ( the house of freedoms ) , which opposed the scorporo system ( an alternate version of mmp ) , linked many of their constituency candidates to a decoy list ( liste civetta ) in the proportional parts , under the name abolizione scorporo ahead of the 2020 south korean legislative election , the electoral system was changed from parallel voting to a hybrid mixed-member proportional system , with 30 seats allocated in a compensatory manner
