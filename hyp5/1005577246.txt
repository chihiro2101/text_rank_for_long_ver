in addition , it is used in the manufacture of heat-resistant composite materials they are easily worked , molded , and thermoformed for many applications , such as electronic components , construction materials , data storage devices , automotive and aircraft parts , check sockets in prosthetics , and security glazing polyoxymethylene ( pom ) , also known as acetal,2 polyacetal and polyformaldehyde , is an engineering thermoplastic used in precision parts requiring high stiffness , low friction , and excellent dimensional stability as with many other synthetic polymers , it is produced by different chemical firms with slightly different formulas and sold variously by such names as delrin , celcon , ramtal , duracon , kepital and hostaform ppo is difficult to process , and hence the commercial resin ( noryl ) is made by blending ppo with high-impact polystyrene ( hips ) , which serves to reduce the processing temperature pps is principally used in coating applications principal applications of injection and compression molded pps include cookware , bearings , and pump parts for service in various corrosive environments polystyrene is manufactured in various forms that have different applications expanded polystyrene foam ( eps ) is used in making insulation and packaging materials , such as the '' peanuts '' and molded foam used to cushion fragile products it is also converted to flexible forms with the addition of plasticizers , thereby making it useful for items such as hoses , tubing , electrical insulation , coats , jackets and upholstery flexible pvc is also used in inflatable products , such as water beds and pool toys pvc is produced in many specific modifications to affect its chemical and physical properties the original form is often referred to as unplasticized polyvinyl chloride ( upvc ) , which is the more commonly used type for installations such as water , waste , and sewer conveyance plumbing cpvc is commonly used in water , chemical , hot and cold , delivery systems for residential , commercial , and industrial applications pvdf thermoplastic is fabricated into sheets and pipes for engineering uses as well as powders and coatings that can be dissolved in solvents and applied across a product surface pvdf is widely used in the chemical industry as piping for aggressive chemicals and high purity liquids the pvdf material is used in construction , transportation , chemical processes , electricity , batteries , waste water and treatment this also supports its use in coatings of cooking ware the polymer has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid and is therefore commonly used for bearings and support of moving mechanical parts
