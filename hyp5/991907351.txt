since the 1970s , two broad reactions against neoclassical approaches have significantly changed the discipline : marxist political economy , growing out of the work of david harvey ; and the new economic geography which takes into account social , cultural , and institutional factors in the spatial economy krugman called his application of spatial thinking to international trade theory the '' new economic geography '' , which directly competes with an approach within the discipline of geography that is also called '' new economic geography '' contemporary economic geographers tend to specialize in areas such as location theory and spatial analysis ( with the help of geographic information systems ) , market research , geography of transportation , real estate price evaluation , regional and global development , planning , internet geography , innovation , social networks as economic geography is a very broad discipline , with economic geographers using many different methodologies in the study of economic phenomena in the world some distinct approaches to study have evolved over time : theoretical economic geography focuses on building theories about spatial arrangement and distribution of economic activities using historical data , it examines how centers of population and economic activity shift , what patterns of regional specialization and localization evolve over time and what factors explain these changes more specifically , evolutionary economic geography uses concepts and ideas from evolutionary economics to understand the evolution of cities , regions , and other economic systems economic geography is sometimes approached as a branch of human geography that focuses on regional systems of human economic activity an alternative description of different approaches to the study of human economic activity can be organized around spatiotemporal analysis , analysis of production/consumption of economic items , and analysis of economic flow spatiotemporal systems of analysis include economic activities of region , mixed social spaces , and development geographers , on the other hand , are interested in the economic processes ' impact on spatial structures an economic geographer will often take a more holistic approach to the analysis of economic phenomena , which is to conceptualize a problem in terms of space , place , and scale as well as the overt economic problem that is being examined industries have different patterns of economic geography the new economy , generally characterized by globalization , increasing use of information and communications technology , the growth of knowledge goods , and feminization , has enabled economic geographers to study social and spatial divisions caused by the rising new economy , including the emerging digital divide new economic geography 2 ( neg2 ) also seeks to explain the apparently paradoxical emergence of industrial clusters in a contemporary context , however , it emphasizes relational , social , and contextual aspects of economic behaviour , particularly the importance of tacit knowledge however , the focus on the firm as the main entity of significance hinders the discussion of new economic geography it limits the discussion in a national and global context and confines it to a smaller scale context spatial divisions within these arising new economic geographies are apparent in the form of the digital divide , as a result of regions attracting talented workers instead of developing skills at a local level ( see creative class for further reading ) despite increasing inter-connectivity through developing information communication technologies , the contemporary world is still defined through its widening social and spatial divisions , most of which are increasingly gendered
