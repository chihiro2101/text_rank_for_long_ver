in an early essay , holt contrasted the two terms : gws will say 'unschooling ' when we mean taking children out of school , and 'deschooling ' when we mean changing the laws to make schools non-compulsory the term '' unschooling '' became used as a contrast to versions of home schooling that were perceived as politically and pedagogically '' school-like , '' using textbooks and exercises at home , the same way they would be used at school some unschoolers criticize that in schools , children are taught a set of facts and skills that they might not need in the future anymore , while with unschooling , they learn how to learn , which is far more sustainable for their life also , some say that in school , children are only taught how to follow instructions , which means that they face problems with doing tasks they have not done before unschoolers may have time to share a role in their greater community , therefore relating more to older and younger individuals and finding their place within more diverse groups of people parents of school children also have little say regarding who their instructors and teachers are , whereas parents of unschoolers may be more involved in the selection of the coaches or mentors their children work with and with whom they build lasting and ongoing relationships according to unschooling pioneer john holt , child-led learning is more efficient and respectful of children 's time , takes advantage of their interests , and allows deeper exploration of subjects than what is possible in conventional education from this , an argument can be made that institutionalizing children in a so-called '' one size fits all '' or '' factory model '' school is an inefficient use of the children 's time and potential , because it requires each child to learn specific subject matter in a particular manner , at a particular pace , and at a specific time regardless of that individual 's present or future needs , interests , goals , or any pre-existing knowledge they might have about the topic traditional education requires all children to begin reading at the same time and do multiplication at the same time ; unschoolers believe that some children can not help but be bored because this was something that they had been ready to learn earlier , and even worse , some children can not help but fail , because they are not yet ready for this new information being taught unschoolers sometimes state that learning any specific subject is less important than learning how to learn it is asserted that this ability to learn on their own makes it more likely that later , when these children are adults , they can continue to learn what they need to know to meet newly emerging needs , interests , and goals ; and that they can return to any subject that they feel was not sufficiently covered or learn a completely new subject common parental activities include sharing interesting books , articles , and activities with their children , helping them find knowledgeable people to explore an interest with ( anyone from physics professors to automotive mechanics ) , and helping them set goals and figure out what they need to do to meet their goals unschooling opposes many aspects of what the dominant culture insists are true , and it may be impossible to fully understand the unschooling philosophy of education without both active participation and a major paradigm shift '' while opponents of the concept of unschooling criticize the fact that it can not be ensured that children receive a neutral , comprehensive education and fear that children may be at the mercy of bad parents , resulting in parallel society , many advocates of unschooling doubt that or at least question whether such an education exists universally objectively seen and note that in school , people do not learn a lot of what they are guaranteed to need for their life either and that when unschooled , more efficient and independent learning guided by their own interests increases the probability that children will be well equipped for their future life because they learned how to learn and already roughly know what they are interested in and some things about these areas they also find that children can be at least just as much at the mercy of one or more bad teachers and classmates in school and consider it exceedingly unrealistic that parents would completely isolate their children from external social influences or even criticize school as an institution in which children are fobbed off from the outside world and therefore see school itself as a parallel society from then on , it is only a subjective decision as to where , when , how and with whom education should take place , which those to be educated should answer themselfes , or , if necessary , with people directly involved in their education , like their parents or other people who educate them it involves teaching children based on their interests rather than a set curriculum many other forms of alternative education also place a great deal of importance on student control of learning , albeit not necessarily of the individual learner questions about the merits of unschooling raise concerns on its absence of the following qualities , compared to established systems : socialization â€“ schools provide a ready-made group of peers , but unschooled children need other ways to make friends in their age group however , ironically , some people say that the exact opposite is the case by criticizing that social interaction , communication and discussion in schools are strictly regulated and that students spend most of their time in school almost exclusively with people of the same age , which would result in a lack of social and emotional skills
