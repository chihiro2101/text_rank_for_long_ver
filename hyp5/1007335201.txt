in both europe and the far east , traditionally the artist only designed the woodcut , and the block-carving was left to specialist craftsmen , called block-cutters , some of whom became well-known in their own right this is why woodcuts are sometimes described by museums or books as '' designed by '' rather than '' by '' an artist ; but most authorities do not use this distinction in the west , many artists used the easier technique of linocut instead there are three methods of printing to consider : stamping : used for many fabrics and most early european woodcuts ( 1400–40 ) used for european woodcuts and block-books later in the fifteenth century , and very widely for cloth also used for many western woodcuts from about 1910 to the present in europe , woodcut is the oldest technique used for old master prints , developing about 1400 , by using , on paper , existing techniques for printing michael wolgemut was significant in making german woodcuts more sophisticated from about 1475 , and erhard reuwich was the first to use cross-hatching ( far harder to do than engraving or etching ) both of these produced mainly book-illustrations , as did various italian artists who were also raising standards there at the same period woodcut was used less often for individual ( '' single-leaf '' ) fine-art prints from about 1550 until the late nineteenth century , when interest revived woodblock printing in japan is called moku-hanga and was introduced in the seventeenth century for both books and art later , prints with many colours were developed japanese woodcut became a major artistic form , although at the time it was accorded a much lower status than painting this process was invented by the sixteenth-century swiss artist urs graf , but became most popular in the nineteenth and twentieth century , often in a modified form where images used large areas of white-line contrasted with areas in the normal black-line style though the japanese influence was reflected in many artistic media , including painting , it did lead to a revival of the woodcut in europe , which had been in danger of extinction as a serious art medium see below for japanese influence in illustrations for children 's books artists , notably edvard munch and franz masereel , continued to use the medium , which in modernism came to appeal because it was relatively easy to complete the whole process , including printing , in a studio with little special equipment in europe and japan , colour woodcuts were normally only used for prints rather than book illustrations in china , where the individual print did not develop until the nineteenth century , the reverse is true , and early colour woodcuts mostly occur in luxury books about art , especially the more prestigious medium of painting the first known example is a book on ink-cakes printed in 1606 , and colour technique reached its height in books on painting published in the seventeenth century l sickman & a soper , '' the art and architecture of china '' , pelican history of art , 3rd ed 1971 , penguin , loc 70-125675 in japan colour technique , called nishiki-e in its fully developed form , spread more widely , and was used for prints , from the 1760s on a number of different methods of colour printing using woodcut ( technically chromoxylography ) were developed in europe in the 19th century artists such as randolph caldecott , walter crane and kate greenaway were influenced by the japanese prints now available and japonism in europe to create a suitable style , with flat areas of colour in the 20th century , ernst ludwig kirchner of the die brücke group developed a process of producing colored woodcut prints using a single block applying different colors to the block with a brush à la poupée and then printing ( halfway between a woodcut and a monotype ) image:5154 bassenge anon c16 italian.jpg thumb chiaroscuro woodcut depicting playing cupids by anonymous 16th-century italian artist chiaroscuro woodcuts are old master prints in woodcut using two or more blocks printed in different colours ; they do not necessarily feature strong contrasts of light and dark after some early experiments in book-printing , the true chiaroscuro woodcut conceived for two blocks was probably first invented by lucas cranach the elder in germany in 1508 or 1509 , though he backdated some of his first prints and added tone blocks to some prints first produced for monochrome printing , swiftly followed by hans burgkmair in the german states the technique was in use largely during the first decades of the sixteenth century , but italians continued to use it throughout the century , and later artists like hendrik goltzius sometimes made use of it the italians usually used only tone blocks , for a very different effect , much closer to the chiaroscuro drawings the term was originally used for , or to watercolor paintings woodcut printmaking became a popular form of art in mexico during the early to mid 20th century the woodcut art served well because it was a popular style that many could understand the tgp attracted artists from all around the world including african american printmaker elizabeth catlett , whose woodcut prints later influenced the art of social movements in the us in the 1960s and 1970s woodcut in early printed books ( online exhibition from the library of congress ) a collection of woodcuts images can be found at the university of houston digital library meditations , or the contemplations of the most devout is a 15th-century publication that is considered the first italian illustrated book , using early woodcut techniques
