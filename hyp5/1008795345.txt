anthropocentrism , also known as homocentricism or human supremacism , has been posited by some environmentalists , in such books as confessions of an eco-warrior by dave foreman and green rage by christopher manes , as the underlying ( if unstated ) reason why humanity dominates and sees the need to '' develop '' most of the earth anthropocentrism is believed by some to be the central problematic concept in environmental philosophy , where it is used to draw attention claims of a systematic bias in traditional western attitudes to the non-human world man 's responsibility for nature london : duckworth has been criticised by defenders of deep ecology because of its anthropocentrism , often claimed to be constitutive of traditional western moral thought the problem with a '' shallow '' viewpoint is not that it is human-centred but that according to william grey : '' what 's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans , but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists many devoted environmentalists encompass a somewhat anthropocentric-based philosophical view supporting the fact that they will argue in favor of saving the environment for the sake of human populations human flourishing may certainly be included as a legitimate part of such a flourishing however an argument can be made that the bible actually places all the importance on god as creator , and humans as merely another part of creation these teachings mainly focus on the development of moral values , but it implicitly leads to the statement that humans are superior to other animals to the extreme , some may even say that humans is not a member of animals '' adler is stating here , that denying what is now called human exceptionalism could lead to tyranny , writing that if we ever came to believe that humans do not possess a unique moral status , the intellectual foundation of our liberties collapses : '' why , then , should not groups of superior men be able to justify their enslavement , exploitation , or even genocide of inferior human groups on factual and moral grounds akin to those we now rely on to justify our treatment of the animals we harness as beasts of burden , that we butcher for food and clothing , or that we destroy as disease-bearing pests or as dangerous predators ? '' mortimer j writing in a rat is a pig is a dog is a boy , a critique of animal rights ideology , '' because we are unquestionably a unique species—the only species capable of even contemplating ethical issues and assuming responsibilities—we uniquely are capable of apprehending the difference between right and wrong , good and evil , proper and improper conduct toward animals howard moore , who in the universal kinship ( 1906 ) argued that charles darwin on the origin of species ( 1859 ) '' sealed the doom of anthropocentricism '' and that : the supposed psychical gulf between human and non-human beings has no more existence , outside the flamboyant imagination of man , than has the once-supposed physical gulf philosophers such as peter singer and david pearce have argued against anthropocentric ethics , instead advocating for antispeciesist or sentientism ethics , which rather than giving more value to humans based on their species membership , assert that '' other things being equal , equally strong interests should count equally although relatively little is known about its persistence at a later age , evidence exists that this pattern of human exceptionalist thinking can continue through young adulthood at least , even among students who have been increasingly educated in biology the notion that anthropocentric thinking is an innate human characteristic has been challenged by study of american children raised in urban environments , among whom it appears to emerge between the ages of 3 and 5 years as an acquired perspective children 's recourse to anthropocentric thinking seems to vary with their experience of nature , and cultural assumptions about the place of humans in the natural world studies involving children from some of the indigenous peoples of the americas have found little use of anthropocentric thinking study of children among the wichí people in south america showed a tendency to think of living organisms in terms of their folk taxonomy , ecological considerations , and animistic traditions , resulting in a much less anthropocentric view of the natural world than is experienced by many children in western societies '' the 2012 documentary the superior human ? systematically analyzes anthropocentrism and concludes that value is fundamentally an opinion , and since life forms naturally value their own traits , most humans are misled to believe that they are actually more valuable than other species
