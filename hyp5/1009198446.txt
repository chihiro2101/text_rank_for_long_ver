the wco created the first-ever set of rules for formal competitions , including weight classes , timed round system , original judging criteria and a 10-point must system - giving an increasing number of athletes worldwide an opportunity to compete in these global competitions street workout competitions have also popularised 'freestyle calisthenics ' , which is a style of calisthenics where the athlete uses their power and momentum to perform dynamic skills and tricks on the bar , often as part of a routine where each trick is linked together in a consistent flow the arms are used to lift the body while maintaining a straight line from head to heel the arms go from fully extended in the high position to nearly fully flexed in the low position while avoiding resting on the floor an easier version of this exercise consists of placing the hands on a wall and then bending and straightening the arms for people who find it difficult to get down onto the ground , a similar range of motion can be achieved by standing with the legs slightly bent , and then bowing slightly and straightening up again chin-ups and pull-ups : chin-ups and pull-ups are similar exercises but use opposite facing grips the subject lifts their body up , chin level with the bar , and keeping the back straight throughout the subject then slowly returns to starting position in a slow controlled manner : a back lever is performed by lowering from an inverted hang from rings or bar , until the gymnast 's body is parallel to the ground and facing towards the floor in a basic handstand , the body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended , with hands spaced approximately shoulder-width apart hyperextensions : performed in a prone position on the ground , the individual raises the legs , arms and upper body off the ground performed by entering a squatting position , then using a plyometric jumping movement to jump as high as possible two people may hold onto different ends of a rope and pull in different directions one person would deliberately provide a lesser amount of resistance , which adds resistance to the exercise whilst also allowing the other person to move through a full range of motion as their superior level of force application pulls the rope along a disadvantage such exercises have is that it can be hard to measure how much resistance is being added by the partner when considered in comparison to free weights or machines for example , a squat with a partner can be turned into a power-focused exercise by jumping or hopping with the partner instead , or even lifting them up on one knee
