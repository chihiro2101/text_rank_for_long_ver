this led to the cold war , during which the term first world was often used because of its political , social , and economic relevance today , the first world is slightly outdated and has no official definition , however , it is generally thought of as the capitalist , industrial , wealthy , and developed countries after the cold war , these countries of the first world included member states of nato , u.s.-aligned states , neutral countries that were developed and industrialized , and the former british empire that were considered developed daniels , past president of the academy of international business , defines the first world to be consisting of '' high-income industrial countries '' bryjak defines the first world to be the '' modern , industrial , capitalist countries of north america and europe '' in 1945 , the united nations used the terms first , second , third , and fourth worlds to define the relative wealth of nations ( although popular use of the term fourth world did not come about until later ) the second world included modern , wealthy , industrialized nations , but they were all under communist control most of the rest of the world was deemed part of the third world , while the fourth world was considered to be those nations whose people were living on less than us 100 annually the first world is considered to be countries with high-income economies just as the third estate comprised everybody else , sauvy called the third world all the countries that were not in this cold war division , i.e with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 , the eastern bloc ceased to exist and with it , the perfect applicability of the term second world the first world and second world were at constant odds with one another via the tensions between their two cores , the united states and the soviet union , respectively in the quest for expanding their sphere of influence , the united states ( core of the first world ) tried to establish pro us regimes in the third world in addition , because the soviet union ( core of the second world ) also wanted to expand , the third world often became a site for conflict the domino theory largely governed united states policy regarding the third world and their rivalry with the second world the movement of information and technology from the first world to various third world countries has created a general '' aspir ( ation ) to first world living standards '' this exposure causes two changes : a ) living standards in some third world countries rise and b ) this exposure creates hopes and many from third world countries emigrate – both legally and illegally – to these first world countries in hopes of attaining that living standard and prosperity some have argued that the most important human population problem for the world is not the high rate of population increase in certain third world countries , but rather the '' increase in total human impact '' , western europe and japan consume 32 times as many resources and put out 32 times as much waste as those in the third world it proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the united states and other first world countries until the recent past , little attention was paid to the interests of third world countries as more countries have continued to become more developed , the interests of the world have slowly started to shift however , first world nations still have many more universities , professors , journals , and conferences , which has made it very difficult for third world countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world however , most of the theorists were from the united states , and they were not interested in third world countries achieving development by any model ) alternative to the marxist and neo-marxist strategies promoted by the '' second world states '' like the soviet union the european union is an agreement in which countries voluntarily decide to build common governmental institutions to which they delegate some individual national sovereignty so that decisions can be made democratically on a higher level of common interest for europe as a whole in total , the european union produces almost a third of the world 's gross national product and the member states speak more than 23 languages from the beginning of its inception , countries in the eu were judged by many standards , including economic ones a majority of multinational corporations find their origins in first world countries outsourcing is among some of the many reasons for increased competition within developing countries '' aside from being a reason for competition , many first world countries see outsourcing , in particular offshore outsourcing , as an opportunity for increased income developed country developing country digital divide first world privilege first world problem second world third world fourth world globalization
