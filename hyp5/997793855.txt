a small number of people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state ( a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and hypotension ) lifestyle factors are important to the development of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , including obesity and being overweight ( defined by a body mass index of greater than 25 ) , lack of physical activity , poor diet , stress , and urbanization smoking appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes a lack of sleep has also been linked to type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes most cases of diabetes involve many genes , with each being a small contributor to an increased probability of becoming a type & nbsp ; 2 diabetic the tcf7l2 allele , for example , increases the risk of developing diabetes by 1.5 & nbsp ; times and is the greatest risk of the common genetic variants individuals with cancer may be at a higher risk of mortality if they also have diabetes other potentially important mechanisms associated with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes and insulin resistance include : increased breakdown of lipids within fat cells , resistance to and lack of incretin , high glucagon levels in the blood , increased retention of salt and water by the kidneys , and inappropriate regulation of metabolism by the central nervous system the world health organization definition of diabetes ( both type & nbsp ; 1 and type & nbsp ; 2 ) is for a single raised glucose reading with symptoms , otherwise raised values on two occasions , of either : fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 & nbsp ; mmol/l ( 126 & nbsp ; mg/dl ) : or with a glucose tolerance test , two hours after the oral dose a plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 & nbsp ; mmol/l ( 200 & nbsp ; mg/dl ) a random blood sugar of greater than 11.1 & nbsp ; mmol/l ( 200 & nbsp ; mg/dl ) in association with typical symptoms or a glycated hemoglobin ( hba 1c ) of ≥ & nbsp ; 48 & nbsp ; mmol/mol ( ≥ & nbsp ; 6.5 dcct % ) is another method of diagnosing diabetes if the diagnosis is in doubt antibody testing may be useful to confirm type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes and c-peptide levels may be useful to confirm type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , with c-peptide levels normal or high in type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , but low in type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes high-risk groups in the united states include : those over 45 years old ; those with a first degree relative with diabetes ; some ethnic groups , including hispanics , african-americans , and native-americans ; a history of gestational diabetes ; polycystic ovary syndrome ; excess weight ; and conditions associated with metabolic syndrome high levels of physical activity reduce the risk of diabetes by about 28 % in those with impaired glucose tolerance , diet and exercise either alone or in combination with metformin or acarbose may decrease the risk of developing diabetes a 2017 review found that , long term , lifestyle changes decreased the risk by 28 % , while medication does not reduce risk after withdrawal management of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes focuses on lifestyle interventions , lowering other cardiovascular risk factors , and maintaining blood glucose levels in the normal range self-monitoring of blood glucose for people with newly diagnosed type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes may be used in combination with education , although the benefit of self-monitoring in those not using multi-dose insulin is questionable the goal of treatment is typically an hba 1c of 7 to 8 % or a fasting glucose of less than 7.2 & nbsp ; mmol/l ( 130 & nbsp ; mg/dl ) ; however these goals may be changed after professional clinical consultation , taking into account particular risks of hypoglycemia and life expectancy there is weak evidence suggesting that treating gum disease by scaling and root planing may result in a small short-term improvement in blood sugar levels for people with diabetes there is also not enough evidence to determine if medications to treat gum disease are effective at lowering blood sugar levels vegetarianism in general have been related to lower diabetes risk , but do not offer advantages compared with diets which allow moderate amounts of animal products there is not enough evidence to suggest that cinnamon improves blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes culturally appropriate education may help people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes control their blood sugar levels , for up to 24 months if changes in lifestyle in those with mild diabetes has not resulted in improved blood sugars within six weeks , medications should then be considered rosiglitazone , a thiazolidinedione , has not been found to improve long-term outcomes even though it improves blood sugar levels many international guidelines recommend blood pressure treatment targets that are lower than 140/90 & nbsp ; mmhg for people with diabetes 2015 american diabetes association recommendations are that people with diabetes and albuminuria should receive an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system to reduce the risks of progression to end-stage renal disease , cardiovascular events , and death aspirin is recommended in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease , however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes 2015 american diabetes association recommendations for aspirin use ( based on expert consensus or clinical experience ) are that low-dose aspirin use is reasonable in adults with diabetes who are at intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease ( 10-year cardiovascular disease risk , 5–10 % ) many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medication following surgery and long-term mortality is decreased there however is some short-term mortality risk of less than 1 % from the surgery traditionally considered a disease of adults , type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in children in parallel with rising obesity rates subsequent research has supported this , and weight loss is a first line treatment in type 2 diabetes .
