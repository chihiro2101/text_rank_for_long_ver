flavus and aspergillus parasiticus aflatoxin m 1 ( afm 1 ) , metabolite of aflatoxin b 1 in humans and animals ( exposure in ng levels may come from a mother 's milk ) aflatoxin m 2 , metabolite of aflatoxin b 2 in milk of cattle fed on contaminated foods aflatoxicol ( afl ) : metabolite produced by breaking down the lactone ring aflatoxin q 1 ( afq 1 ) , major metabolite of afb 1 in in vitro liver preparations of other higher vertebrates afm , afq , and afl retain the possibly to become an epoxide the presence of those molds does not always indicate that harmful levels of aflatoxin are present , but does indicate a significant risk a study conducted in kenya and mali found that the predominant practices for drying and storage of maize were inadequate in minimizing exposure to aflatoxins adult humans have a high tolerance for aflatoxin exposure and rarely succumb to acute aflatoxicosis , but children are particularly affected , and their exposure can lead to stunted growth and delayed development , in addition to all the symptoms mentioned below as with other dna-alkylating agents , aflatoxin b 1 can cause immune suppression , and exposure to it is associated with an increased viral load in hiv positive individuals the expression of aflatoxin-related diseases is influenced by factors such as species , age , nutrition , sex , and the possibility of concurrent exposure to other toxins conditions increasing the likelihood of aflatoxicosis in humans include limited availability of food , environmental conditions that favour mould growth on foodstuffs , and lack of regulatory systems for aflatoxin monitoring and control low levels of aflatoxin exposure require continuous consumption for several weeks to months in order for signs of liver dysfunction to appear some articles have suggested the toxic level in dog food is 100â€“300 ppb and requires continuous exposure or consumption for a few weeks to months to develop aflatoxicosis some studies on pregnant hamsters showed a significant relationship between exposure of aflatoxin b 1 ( 4 & nbsp ; mg/kg , single dose ) and the appearance of teratology in their offspring there are two principal techniques that have been used most often to detect levels of aflatoxin in humans the presence of this breakdown product indicates exposure to aflatoxin b 1 during the past 24 hours
