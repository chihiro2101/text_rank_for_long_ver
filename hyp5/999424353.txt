for instance , if all occurrences of the letter turn into the letter , a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter would suggest to a cryptanalyst that represents the basic use of frequency analysis is to first count the frequency of ciphertext letters and then associate guessed plaintext letters with them more s in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that corresponds to in the plaintext , but this is not certain ; and are also very common in english , so might be either of them also this is done to provide more information to the cryptanalyst , for instance , and nearly always occur together in that order in english , even though itself is rare eve could use frequency analysis to help solve the message along the following lines : counts of the letters in the cryptogram show that is the most common single letter , most common bigram , and is the most common trigram this would not always be the case , however ; the variation in statistics for individual plaintexts can mean that initial guesses are incorrect for example , entire novels have been written that omit the letter '' '' altogether & mdash ; a form of literature known as a lipogram the first known recorded explanation of frequency analysis ( indeed , of any kind of cryptanalysis ) was given in the 9th century by al-kindi , an arab polymath , in a manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages it has been suggested that close textual study of the qur'an first brought to light that arabic has a characteristic letter frequency polyalphabetic cipher , that is , the use of several alphabets & mdash ; chosen in assorted , more or less devious , ways ( leone alberti seems to have been the first to propose this ) ; and polygraphic substitution , schemes where pairs or triplets of plaintext letters are treated as units for substitution , rather than single letters , for example , the playfair cipher invented by charles wheatstone in the mid-19th century frequency analysis requires only a basic understanding of the statistics of the plaintext language and some problem solving skills , and , if performed by hand , tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis ( generally ibm card type machinery ) were first used in world war ii , possibly by the us army 's sis
