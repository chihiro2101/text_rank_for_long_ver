this theory suggested that in all cases , genes within an operon are negatively controlled by a repressor acting at a single operator located before the first gene today , the operon is simply defined as a cluster of genes transcribed into a single mrna molecule an operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator operons are related to regulons , stimulons and modulons ; whereas operons contain a set of genes regulated by the same operator , regulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single regulatory protein , and stimulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single cell stimulus an operon contains one or more structural genes which are generally transcribed into one polycistronic mrna ( a single mrna molecule that codes for more than one protein ) however , the definition of an operon does not require the mrna to be polycistronic , though in practice , it usually is upstream of the structural genes lies a promoter sequence which provides a site for rna polymerase to bind and initiate transcription all the structural genes of an operon are turned on or off together , due to a single promoter and operator upstream to them , but sometimes more control over the gene expression is needed to achieve this aspect , some bacterial genes are located near together , but there is a specific promoter for each of them ; this is called gene clustering thumb an operon is made up of 3 basic dna components : promoter – a nucleotide sequence that enables a gene to be transcribed in rna synthesis , promoters indicate which genes should be used for messenger rna creation – and , by extension , control which proteins the cell produces not always included within the operon , but important in its function is a regulatory gene , a constantly expressed gene which codes for repressor proteins control of an operon is a type of gene regulation that enables organisms to regulate the expression of various genes depending on environmental conditions in negative repressible operons , transcription of the operon normally takes place however , certain molecules called corepressors are bound by the repressor protein , causing a conformational change to the active site with positive control , an activator protein stimulates transcription by binding to dna ( usually at a site other than the operator ) an alternative method to predict operons is based on finding gene clusters where gene order and orientation is conserved in two or more genomes
