the following is a list of the major ocean basins : about 48.7 % of the world 's land drains to the atlantic ocean the indian ocean 's drainage basin also comprises about 13 % of earth 's land drainage basins have been historically important for determining territorial boundaries , particularly in regions where trade by water has been important , international treaty and , within the us , interstate compacts ) or other political entities in a particular drainage basin to manage the body or bodies of water into which it drains in hydrology , the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the hydrological cycle , because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as precipitation falling on the basin a portion of the water that enters the groundwater system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network measurement of the discharge of water from a basin may be made by a stream gauge located at the basin 's outlet isochrone maps can be used to show the time taken for runoff water within a drainage basin to reach a lake , reservoir or outlet , assuming constant and uniform effective rainfall a drainage basin is the source for water and sediment that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms with the water , they are transported towards the outlet of the basin , and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water source when a river basin crosses at least one political border , either a border within a nation or an international boundary , it is identified as a transboundary river catchment topography and shape determine the time taken for rain to reach the river , while catchment size , soil type , and development determine the amount of water to reach the river size will help determine the amount of water reaching the river , as the larger the catchment the greater the potential for flooding soil type will help determine how much water reaches the river land use can contribute to the volume of water reaching the river , in a similar way to clay soils
