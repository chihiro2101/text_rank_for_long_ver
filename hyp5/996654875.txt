one reason is that humans have a different neuraxis and another is that unlike animals that rest on four limbs , humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the standard anatomical position , which is standing up with arms outstretched because animals can change orientation with respect to their environment , and because appendages like limbs and tentacles can change position with respect to the main body , terms to describe position need to refer to an animal when it is in its standard anatomical position this means descriptions as if the organism is in its standard anatomical position , even when the organism in question has appendages in another position many anatomical terms can be combined , either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body anatomical terms describe structures with relation to four main anatomical planes : the median plane , which divides the body into left and right image : labelled ciliates.jpg thumb organisms where the ends of the long axis are distinct anatomical axes.svg anatomical axes in a human , similar for other orthograde posture vertebrates anatomical directions and axes.jpg anatomical axes and directions in a fish long and short axis.png spheroid or near-spheroid organs such as testis may be measured by '' long '' and '' short '' axis several terms are commonly seen and used as prefixes : sub- is used to indicate something that is beneath , or something that is subordinate to or lesser than for example , subcutaneous means beneath the skin , and '' subglobular '' may mean smaller than a hypo- is used to indicate something that is beneath infra- is used to indicate something that is within or below for example , in the anatomical position , the most superior part of the human body is the head and the most inferior is the feet terms derived from lateral include : contralateral : on the side opposite to another structure the terms proximal and distal are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body , respectively although the direction indicated by '' proximal '' and '' distal '' is always respectively towards or away from the point of attachment , a given structure can be either proximal or distal in relation to another point of reference that might be an organ , a region in the body , or an anatomical structure these two terms , used in anatomy and embryology , describe something at the back ( dorsal ) or front/belly ( ventral ) of an organism the dorsal surface of an organism refers to the back , or upper side , of an organism the ventral surface refers to the front , or lower side , of an organism to describe how close to the head of an animal something is , three distinct terms are used : rostral describes something situated toward the oral or nasal region , or in the case of the brain , toward the tip of the frontal lobe the term '' rostral '' is rarely used in human anatomy , apart from embryology , and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism special terms are used to describe the mouth and teeth this is because although teeth may be aligned with their main axes within the jaw , some different relationships require special terminology as well ; for example , teeth also can be rotated , and in such contexts terms like '' anterior '' or '' lateral '' become ambiguous for example , the terms '' distal '' and '' proximal '' are also redefined to mean the distance away or close to the dental arch , and '' medial '' and '' lateral '' are used to refer to the closeness to the midline of the dental arch terms used to describe structures include '' buccal '' and '' palatal '' referring to structures close to the cheek and hard palate respectively thumb several anatomical terms are particular to the hands and feet for improved clarity , the directional term palmar is usually used to describe the front of the hand , and dorsal is the back of the hand these terms are used to avoid confusion when describing the median surface of the hand and what is the '' anterior '' or '' posterior '' surface '' anterior '' can be used to describe the hand of the hand , and '' posterior '' can be used to describe the back of the hand and arm two related terms , '' abaxial '' and '' adaxial '' , refer to locations away from and toward the central axis of an organism , respectively luminal : on the—hollow—inside of an organ 's lumen ( body cavity or tubular structure ) ; adluminal is towards , abluminal is away from the lumen however , humans stand upright on two legs , meaning their anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral directions the same , and the inferior/superior directions necessary humans do not have a beak , so a term such as '' rostral '' used to refer to the beak in some animals is instead used to refer to part of the brain ; humans do also not have a tail so a term such as '' caudal '' that refers to the tail end may also be used in humans and animals without tails to refer to the hind part of the body in invertebrates , the large variety of body shapes presents a difficult problem when attempting to apply standard directional terms some such borrowed terms are widely applicable in most invertebrates ; for example proximal , meaning '' near '' refers to the part of an appendage nearest to where it joins the body , and distal , meaning '' standing away from '' is used for the part furthest from the point of attachment similarly , in spherical symmetry organisms , there is nothing to distinguish one line through the centre of the organism from any other in organisms that maintain a constant shape and have one dimension longer than the other , at least two directional terms can be used in some cases a third axis can be defined , particularly where a non-terminal cytostome or other unique structure is present in such organisms , the end with a mouth ( or equivalent structure , such as the cytostome in paramecium or stentor ) , or the end that usually points in the direction of the organism 's locomotion ( such as the end with the flagellum in euglena ) , is normally designated as the anterior end properly , this terminology would apply only to an organism that is always planktonic ( not normally attached to a surface ) , although the term can also be applied to one that is sessile ( normally attached to a surface ) the part of the organism attached to the substrate is usually referred to as the basal end , whereas the end furthest from the attachment is referred to as the apical end for this reason , the end of the organism with the mouth is referred to as the oral end , and the opposite surface is the aboral end medial can be used , but in the case of radiates indicates the central point , rather than a central axis as in vertebrates retrolateral refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the posterior end of an arachnid 's body
