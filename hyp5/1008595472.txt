although mexico ceded alta california and santa fe de nuevo méxico , the text of the treaty did not list territories to be ceded , and avoided the disputed issues that were causes of war : the validity of the 1836 secession of the republic of texas , texas 's unenforced boundary claims as far as the rio grande , and the 1845 texas annexation by the united states instead , article v of the treaty simply described the new u.s.–mexico border the others returned to mexico ( where they received land ) , or in some cases in new mexico were allowed to remain in place as mexican citizens it provided that the united states would prevent and punish raids by indians into mexico , prohibited americans from acquiring property , including livestock , taken by the indians in those raids , and stated that the u.s the land that the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo brought into the united states became , between 1850 and 1912 , all or part of ten states : california ( 1850 ) , nevada ( 1864 ) , utah ( 1896 ) , and arizona ( 1912 ) , as well as , depending upon interpretation , the entire state of texas ( 1845 ) , which then included part of kansas ( 1861 ) ; colorado ( 1876 ) ; oklahoma ( 1907 ) ; and new mexico ( 1912 ) mexico had claimed the area in question since winning its independence from the spanish empire in 1821 following the mexican war of independence the mexican government , which had never recognized the republic of texas as an independent country , had warned that annexation would be viewed as an act of war the united kingdom and france , both of which recognized the independence of the republic of texas , repeatedly tried to dissuade mexico from declaring war against its northern neighbor earlier in that year , mexico had broken off diplomatic relations with the united states , based partly on its interpretation of the adams–onís treaty of 1819 , under which newly independent mexico claimed it had inherited rights in that agreement , the united states had '' renounced forever '' all claims to spanish territory meanwhile , polk settled a major territorial dispute with britain via the oregon treaty , which was signed on 15 june 1846 after the thornton affair of 25–26 april , when mexican forces attacked an american unit in the disputed area , with the result that 11 americans were killed , five wounded and 49 captured , congress passed a declaration of war , which polk signed on 13 may 1846 some eastern democrats called for manifest destiny all mexico and claimed that some mexican liberals would welcome this , '' mexican argument for annexation but president polk 's state of the union address in december 1847 upheld mexican independence and argued at length that occupation and any further military operations in mexico were aimed at securing a treaty ceding california and new mexico up to approximately the 32nd parallel north and possibly baja california and transit rights across the isthmus of tehuantepec despite its lengthy string of military defeats , the mexican government was reluctant to agree to the loss of california and new mexico administration to annex mexico outright and what appeared to be deep divisions in domestic u.s it therefore made sense for mexico to negotiate with a goal of pandering to northern u.s this territory was already dominated by anglo-american settlers , but perhaps more importantly from the mexican point of view , it represented the bulk of pre-war mexican territory north of the missouri compromise line of parallel 36°30′ north & nbsp ; — lands that , if annexed by the u.s while the mexican government could not reasonably have expected the polk administration to accept such terms , it would have had reason to hope that a rejection of peace terms so favorable to northern interests might have the potential to provoke sectional conflict in the united states , or perhaps even a civil war that would fatally undermine the u.s notwithstanding that the treaty had been negotiated against his instructions , given its achievement of the major american aim , president polk passed it on to the senate article viii guaranteed that mexicans who remained more than one year in the ceded lands would automatically become full-fledged united states citizens ( or they could declare their intention of remaining mexican citizens ) ; however , the senate modified article ix , changing the first paragraph and excluding the last two among the changes was that mexican citizens would '' be admitted at the proper time ( to be judged of by the congress of the united states ) '' instead of '' admitted as soon as possible '' , as negotiated between trist and the mexican delegation news that new mexico 's legislative assembly had just passed an act for organization of a u.s territorial government helped ease mexican concern about abandoning the people of new mexico the second article confirmed the legitimacy of land grants pursuant to mexican law in addition to the sale of land , the treaty also provided for the recognition of the rio grande as the boundary between the state of texas and mexico the land boundaries were established by a survey team of appointed mexican and american representatives , and published in three volumes as the united states and mexican boundary survey on 30 december 1853 , the countries by agreement altered the border from the initial one by increasing the number of border markers from 6 to 53 government within a year the treaty was signed ; otherwise , they could remain mexican citizens , but they would have to relocate nonetheless , racially tinged tensions persisted in the era following annexation , reflected in such things as the greaser act in california , as tens of thousands of mexican nationals suddenly found themselves living within the borders of the united states disputes about whether to make all this new territory into free states or slave states contributed heavily to the rise in north–south tensions that led to the american civil war just over a decade later the desire to expand the territory of the united states continued unabated and mexico 's economic problems persisted , the u.s.-mexico border : the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo , john c leading to the controversial gadsden purchase in 1854 and william walker 's republic of lower california filibustering incident in that same year the shifting of the rio grande since the signing of the treaty of guadalupe caused a dispute over the boundary between the states of new mexico and texas , a case referred to as the country club dispute that was decided by the u.s controversy over community land grant claims in new mexico persists to this day
