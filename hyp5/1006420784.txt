semiconductor components benefit from moore 's law , an observed principle which states that , for a given price , semiconductor functionality doubles every two years while consumer electronics continues in its trend of convergence , combining elements of many products , consumers face different decisions when purchasing products not traditionally associated with computer use ( such as tvs or hi-fi equipment ) now provide options to connect to the internet or to a computer using a home network to provide access to digital content the desire for high-definition ( hd ) content has led the industry to develop a number of technologies , such as wirelesshd or itu-t g.hn , which are optimized for distribution of hd content between consumer electronic devices in a home most consumer electronics are built in china , due to maintenance cost , availability of materials , quality , and speed as opposed to other countries such as the united states consumer electronics such as personal computers use various types of software consumer electronic service can refer to the maintenance of said products in 2013 , in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , the increased popularity in listening to sound from analog audio devices , such as record players , as opposed to digital sound , has sparked a noticeable increase of business for the electronic repair industry there in 2017 , the greenpeace usa published a study of 17 of the world ’ s leading consumer electronics companies in relation to their energy and resource consumption and the use of chemicals these metals are also used in the renewable energy industry meaning that consumer electronics are directly competing for the raw materials the energy consumption of consumer electronics and their environmental impact , either from their production processes or the disposal of the devices , is increasing steadily eia estimates that electronic devices and gadgets account for about 10 % –15 % of the energy use in american homes – largely because of their number ; the average house has dozens of electronic devices a 2012 study in the united kingdom , carried out by the energy saving trust , found that the devices using the most power on standby mode included televisions , satellite boxes and other video and audio equipment consumers can reduce unwanted use of standby power by unplugging their devices , using power strips with switches , or by buying devices that are standardized for better energy management , particularly energy star marked products a high number of different metals and low concentration rates in electronics means that recycling is limited and energy intensive however , large amounts of the produced electronic waste from developed countries is exported , and handled by the informal sector in countries like india , despite the fact that exporting electronic waste to them is illegal
