karneni , penguin , 1954 , , see introduction by rosemary edmonds levin is often considered a semi-autobiographical portrayal of tolstoy 's own beliefs , struggles , and life events additionally ,

see kent & berberova give all the russian names in full , as used by the author ; any reader will be grateful for the footnotes that elucidate anything not immediately accessible to someone not well acquainted with imperial russia '' i consider the gkb garnett–kent–berberova a very good version , even though it is based on an out-of-date russian text turner 's a karenina companion ( 1993 ) , although he calls their version '' certainly a good translation '' reviewing the translations by bartlett and schwartz for the new york times book review , masha gessen noted that each new translation of anna karenina ended up highlighting an aspect of tolstoy 's '' variable voice '' in the novel , and thus , '' the tolstoy of garnett '' the practice favored by most translators , however , has been

of tolstoy
