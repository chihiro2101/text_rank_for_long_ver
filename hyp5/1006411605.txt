ōkōchi , apparently impressed with tanaka 's energy and ambition , agreed to help the young man start a drafting office in tokyo in december 1945 , as the first postwar diet was being planned by the american occupation authorities , tanaka was able to give generous donations to an associate affiliated with the japan moderate progressive party ( nihon shinpoto ) in 1946 , he moved from tokyo to niigata to prepare his first bid for a diet seat : he worked around the election laws of the time by buying buildings throughout the district and placing large '' tanaka '' signs on them yoshida and the dlp dropped most of their ties with tanaka , removed him from his official party posts , and refused to fund his next re-election bid that year 's election was also the first in which he was supported by billionaire capitalist kenji osano , who would remain one of tanaka 's most loyal supporters to the end he already carried great influence in the ldp , despite his lack of seniority : this was partly because of his friendship with future prime minister eisaku satō , and partly because his stepdaughter had married future prime minister hayato ikeda 's nephew , giving him a personal relationship with both key heads of the party when satō became prime minister in 1965 , tanaka was slated to become the ldp 's new secretary general , but the emergence of the eisaku satō , where tanaka was accused of shady land deals in tokyo , meant that takeo fukuda got the job instead in 1971 , satō gave tanaka another important stepping stone to taking over the government : ministry of international trade and industry one of tanaka 's most remembered achievements is normalizing japanese relations with the people 's republic of china , which occurred around the same time as richard nixon 's efforts to do the same for chinese relations with the united states his visit to europe was the first visit by a japanese prime minister since 1962 , and his visit to the ussr was the first since 1956 his state visit to indonesia as invited by suharto to discuss indo-japanese trade relations was protested by a number of local anti-japanese sentiments denying international investment , which occurred on 15 january 1974 the article inspired tanaka 's ldp rivals to open a public inquiry in the diet ( among other things , tanaka had purchased a geisha and used her name for a number of shady land deals in tokyo during the mid-sixties ) unknown to the committee members , sato and tanaka had been involved in a romantic relationship for several years , and tanaka took pity on sato 's troubled upbringing although henry kissinger tried to stop the details from making their way to the japanese government , fearing that it would harm the two countries ' security relationship , miki pushed a bill through the diet that requested information from the senate many tanaka supporters viewed the scandal as an effort by american multinational corporations to '' get '' tanaka in response to his hard-line stance in trade talks with the united states , based on the fact that the scandal originated with congressional testimony in the us this sparked a month-long war in the diet over whether or not to censure tanaka ; eventually , prime minister nakasone , himself elected by tanaka 's faction , dissolved the diet and called for a new election , stating that '' in view of the current unusual parliamentary situation , there is a need for refreshing the people 's minds as quickly as possible the ldp performed poorly , and prime minister nakasone publicly vowed to distance the party from tanaka 's politics , stating that the party should be '' cleansed '' with a new code of ethics amid tanaka 's objections , noboru takeshita formed a '' study group '' called soseikai on 7 february 1985 , which counted among its ranks 43 of the 121 tanaka faction members his daughter makiko spirited him from the hospital after authorities refused to give the former prime minister an entire floor , and the diet session halted entirely while details of tanaka 's condition leaked out to the press susumu nikaido , the titular chairman of tanaka 's faction , mounted a campaign against takeshita to attempt to win over members of tanaka 's faction amid uncertainty as to his condition , which was only known to tanaka 's family and doctors the announcement ended his 42-year career in politics ; the remnants of his faction , now led by former prime minister takeshita , remained the most powerful bloc within the ldp at the time of his retirement after obuchi 's death , hashimoto led the faction until refusing to stand in the 2005 general election due to a fundraising scandal , and died shortly thereafter the faction raised much less in donations during the 1990s and 2000s than it did under tanaka and takeshita in the 1980s , as electoral reforms enacted in 1994 , coupled with new campaign finance regulations and the ongoing economic slump that followed the japanese asset price bubble , weakened the power of factions in japanese politics this technique was used to some success by two prominent politicians decades later : junichiro koizumi , who recruited a large number of new ldp representatives dubbed '' koizumi children '' in the 2005 election , and ichiro ozawa , who did the same for the democratic party of japan in the 2009 election however , neither the '' koizumi children '' nor the '' ozawa children '' showed the same degree of loyalty as the tanaka faction , with many '' koizumi children '' voting against koizumi 's reform agenda , and many '' ozawa children '' voting against ozawa in his 2010 bid for the dpj presidency due in part to her father 's historical role in sino-japanese relations , she became popular in the people 's republic of china and publicly opposed several anti-prc actions by japan and the united states , including koizumi 's visits to yasukuni shrine she lost her seat in the 2012 japanese general election , by which point etsuzankai had disbanded with only a few elderly surviving members .
