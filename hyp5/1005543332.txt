a conceptual form from this root appears in ancient texts as saṃsaraṇa , which means '' going around through a succession of states , birth , rebirth of living beings and the world '' , without obstruction the term shortens to saṃsāra , referring to the same concept , as a '' passage through successive states of mundane existence '' , a transmigration , metempsychosis , a circuit of living where one repeats previous states , from one body to another , a worldly life of constant change , that is rebirth , growth , decay and redeath while the idea is mentioned in the samhita layers of the vedas , there is lack of clear exposition there , and the idea fully develops in the early upanishads 947–48 the word samsara is related to saṃsṛti , the latter referring to the '' course of mundane existence , transmigration , flow , circuit or stream '' the concept of saṃsāra is closely associated with the belief that the person continues to be born and reborn in various realms and forms the earliest layers of vedic text incorporate the concept of life , followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues ( merit ) or vices ( demerit ) the historical origins of a concept of a cycle of repeated reincarnation are obscure but the idea appears in texts of both india and ancient greece during the first millennium bc 451–53 , 459–68 the late textual layers of the vedas mention and anticipate the doctrine of karma and rebirth , however states stephen laumakis , the idea is not fully developed the evidence for who influenced whom in the ancient times , is slim and speculative , and the odds are the historic development of the samsara theories likely happened in parallel with mutual influences while saṃsāra is usually described as rebirth and reincarnation of living beings , the chronological development of the idea over its history began with the questions on what is the true nature of human existence and whether people die only once these early theories asserted that the nature of human existence involves two realities , one unchanging absolute atman ( soul ) which is somehow connected to the ultimate unchanging immortal reality and bliss called brahman , and that the rest is the always-changing subject ( body ) in a phenomenal world ( maya ) each indian spiritual tradition developed its own assumptions and paths ( marga or yoga ) for this spiritual release , with some developing the ideas of jivanmukti ( liberation and freedom in this life ) , klaus klostermaier , mokṣa and critical theory , philosophy east and west , vol
