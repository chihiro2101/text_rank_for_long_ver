image : crow instability contrail.jpg thumb the crow instability of a jet aeroplane 's contrail visually demonstrates the vortex created in the atmosphere ( gas fluid medium ) by the passage of the aircraft a key concept in the dynamics of vortices is the vorticity , a vector that describes the local rotary motion at a point in the fluid , as would be perceived by an observer that moves along with it conceptually , the vorticity could be observed by placing a tiny rough ball at the point in question , free to move with the fluid , and observing how it rotates about its center the core of a vortex in air is sometimes visible because water vapor condenses as the low pressure of the core causes adiabatic cooling ; the funnel of a tornado is an example when a vortex line ends at a boundary surface , the reduced pressure may also draw matter from that surface into the core a vortex that ends at the free surface of a body of water ( like the whirlpool that often forms over a bathtub drain ) may draw a column of air down the core a vortex flow might also be combined with a radial or axial flow pattern as long as the effects of viscosity and diffusion are negligible , the fluid in a moving vortex is carried along with it in particular , the fluid in the core ( and matter trapped by it ) tends to remain in the core as the vortex moves about thus vortices ( unlike surface waves and pressure waves ) can transport mass , energy and momentum over considerable distances compared to their size , with surprisingly little dispersion this in turn creates around itself a corresponding negative vortex of electric fluid aerodynamic drag can be explained in large part by the formation of vortices in the surrounding fluid that carry away energy from the moving body taylorâ€“couette flow occurs in a fluid between two nested cylinders , one rotating , the other fixed when a vortex is moving , sometimes , it can affect an angular position
