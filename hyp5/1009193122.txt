galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte , or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water ( containing salts ) contacts pipes or metal structures in any given environment ( one standard medium is aerated , room-temperature seawater ) , one metal will be either more noble or more active than others , based on how strongly its ions are bound to the surface often it is possible to chemically remove the products of corrosion for example , phosphoric acid in the form of naval jelly is often applied to ferrous tools or surfaces to remove rust corrosion removal should not be confused with electropolishing , which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface an extreme example is graphite , which releases large amounts of energy upon oxidation , but has such slow kinetics that it is effectively immune to electrochemical corrosion under normal conditions on the other hand , unusual conditions may result in passivation of materials that are normally unprotected , as the alkaline environment of concrete does for steel rebar certain conditions , such as low concentrations of oxygen or high concentrations of species such as chloride which compete as anions , can interfere with a given alloy 's ability to re-form a passivating film corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified , and can cause corrosion pits of several types , depending upon conditions pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys , but it can be prevented by control of the alloy 's environment this form of corrosion is often difficult to detect due to the fact that it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion-produced compounds stainless steel can pose special corrosion challenges , since its passivating behavior relies on the presence of a major alloying component ( chromium , at least 11.5 % ) this chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary , making those areas much less resistant to corrosion this creates a galvanic couple with the well-protected alloy nearby , which leads to '' weld decay '' ( corrosion of the grain boundaries in the heat affected zones ) in highly corrosive environments special alloys , either with low carbon content or with added carbon '' getters '' such as titanium and niobium ( in types 321 and 347 , respectively ) , can prevent this effect , but the latter require special heat treatment after welding to prevent the similar phenomenon of '' knifeline attack '' a critical crevice corrosion temperature is commonly used to rank a material 's resistance to crevice corrosion high-temperature corrosion is chemical deterioration of a material ( typically a metal ) as a result of heating this non-galvanic form of corrosion can occur when a metal is subjected to a hot atmosphere containing oxygen , sulfur , or other compounds capable of oxidizing ( or assisting the oxidation of ) the material concerned for example , materials used in aerospace , power generation and even in car engines have to resist sustained periods at high temperature in which they may be exposed to an atmosphere containing potentially highly corrosive products of combustion the formation of oxides on stainless steels , for example , can provide a protective layer preventing further atmospheric attack , allowing for a material to be used for sustained periods at both room and high temperatures in hostile conditions management of accelerated low water corrosion in steel maritime structures , volume 634 of ciria series , piles that have been coated and have cathodic protection installed at the time of construction are not susceptible to alwc affected areas can also be treated using cathodic protection , using either sacrificial anodes or applying current to an inert anode to produce a calcareous deposit , which will help shield the metal from further attack metal dusting is a catastrophic form of corrosion that occurs when susceptible materials are exposed to environments with high carbon activities , such as synthesis gas and other high-co environments however , in some regimes no m 3 c species is observed indicating a direct transfer of metal atoms into the graphite layer various treatments are used to slow corrosion damage to metallic objects which are exposed to the weather , salt water , acids , or other hostile environments platings usually fail only in small sections , but if the plating is more noble than the substrate ( for example , chromium on steel ) , a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would the design life is directly related to the metal coating thickness such methods make the system less sensitive to scratches or defects in the coating , since extra inhibitors can be made available wherever metal becomes exposed anodizing is very resilient to weathering and corrosion , so it is commonly used for building facades and other areas where the surface will come into regular contact with the elements a new form of protection has been developed by applying certain species of bacterial films to the surface of metals in highly corrosive environments for effective cp , the potential of the steel surface is polarized ( pushed ) more negative until the metal surface has a uniform potential the formation of an oxide layer is described by the dealâ€“grove model , which is used to predict and control oxide layer formation in diverse situations the method involves exposing a clean weighed piece of the metal or alloy to the corrosive environment for a specified time followed by cleaning to remove corrosion products and weighing the piece to determine the loss of weight
