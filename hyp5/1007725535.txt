the data link provides for the transfer of data frames between hosts connected to the physical link within the semantics of the osi network architecture , the protocols of the data link layer respond to service requests from the network layer , and perform their function by issuing service requests to the physical layer that transfer can be reliable or unreliable ; many data link protocols do not have acknowledgments of successful frame reception and acceptance , and some data link protocols might not even perform any check for transmission errors the frame header contains the source and destination addresses that indicate which device originated the frame and which device is expected to receive and process it in contrast to the hierarchical and routable addresses of the network layer , layer 2 addresses are flat , meaning that no part of the address can be used to identify the logical or physical group to which the address belongs in the itu-t g.hn standard , which provides a way to create a high-speed ( up to 1 gigabit/s ) local area network using existing home wiring ( power lines , phone lines and coaxial cables ) , the data link layer is divided into three sub-layers ( application protocol convergence , logical link control and media access control ) the data link layer has two sublayers : logical link control ( llc ) and media access control ( mac ) the uppermost sublayer , llc , multiplexes protocols running at the top of the data link layer , and optionally provides flow control , acknowledgment , and error notification it specifies which mechanisms are to be used for addressing stations over the transmission medium and for controlling the data exchanged between the originator and recipient machines the media access control sublayer also performs frame synchronization , which determines the start and end of each frame of data in the transmission bitstream the services provided by the data link layer are : encapsulation of network layer data packets into frames frame synchronization in the logical link control ( llc ) sublayer : error control ( automatic repeat request , arq ) , in addition to arq provided by some transport-layer protocols , to forward error correction ( fec ) techniques provided on the physical layer , and to error-detection and packet canceling provided at all layers , including the network layer in addition to framing , the data link layer may also perform mechanisms to detect and recover from transmission errors this algorithm is often used in the data link layer the tcp/ip link layer has the operating scope of the link a host is connected to , and only concerns itself with hardware issues to the point of obtaining hardware ( mac ) addresses for locating hosts on the link and transmitting data frames onto the link
