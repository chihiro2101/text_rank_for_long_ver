characteristics shared by members of a group may include interests , values , representations , ethnic or social background , and kinship ties it succeeds in providing the researcher with the tools required to answer three important questions : '' how is a group formed ? '' '' how does a group function ? '' '' how does one describe those social interactions that occur on the way to forming a group ? '' the attention of those who use , participate in , or study groups has focused on functioning groups , on larger organizations , or on the decisions made in these organizations much less attention has been paid to the more ubiquitous and universal social behaviors that do not clearly demonstrate one or more of the five necessary elements described by sherif some of the earliest efforts to understand these social units have been the extensive descriptions of urban street gangs in the 1920s and 1930s , continuing through the 1950s , which understood them to be largely reactions to the established authority of course , while this is true , it is equally likely that the study of the social ( group ) behaviors of other animals might shed light on the evolutionary roots of social behavior in people but these social behaviors and interactions between human individuals play a special role in the study of groups : they are necessarily prior to the formation of groups coming to understand territorial and dominance behaviors may thus help to clarify the development , functioning , and productivity of groups monterey , ca : brooks/cole here , rather than defining a social group based on expressions of cohesive social relationships between individuals , the social identity model assumes that '' psychological group membership has primarily a perceptual or cognitive basis '' it posits that the necessary and sufficient condition for individuals to act as group members is '' awareness of a common category membership '' and that a social group can be '' usefully conceptualized as a number of individuals who have internalized the same social category membership as a component of their self concept '' stated otherwise , while the social cohesion approach expects group members to ask '' who am i attracted to ? '' , the social identity perspective expects group members to simply ask '' who am i ? '' empirical support for the social identity perspective on groups was initially drawn from work using the minimal group paradigm whereas social identity theory was directed initially at the explanation of intergroup conflict in the absence of any conflict of interests , self-categorization theory was developed to explain how individuals come to perceive themselves as members of a group in the first place , and how this self-grouping process underlies and determines all problems subsequent aspects of group behaviour in his text , group dynamics , forsyth ( 2010 ) discuses several common characteristics of groups that can help to define them relationship interactions : “ actions performed by group members that relate to or influence the emotional and interpersonal bonds within the group , including both positive actions ( social support , consideration ) and negative actions ( criticism , conflict ) “ the state of being dependent , to some degree , on other people , as when one ’ s outcomes , actions , thoughts , feelings , and experiences are determined in whole or part by others group structure involves the emergence or regularities , norms , roles and relations that form within a group over time roles involve the expected performance and conduct of people within the group depending on their status or position within the group ” several factors play a part in this image of unity , including group cohesiveness , and entitativity ( appearance of cohesion by outsiders ) such groups may act as the principal source of socialization for individuals as primary groups may shape an individual ’ s attitudes , values , and social orientation these groups are often formed due to a common goal , social categories of which one is a member ) with reasonable ease no matter where you work or what the occupation is , feeling a sense of belonging in a peer group is a key to overall success conditions do not need to be life-threatening , one 's social group can help deal with work anxiety as well social groups tend to form based on certain principles of attraction , that draw individuals to affiliate with each other , eventually forming a group proximity principle – the tendency for individuals to develop relationships and form groups with those they are ( often physically ) close to conversely , if a dislikes b , b will probably not like a ( negative reciprocity ) elaboration principle – the tendency for groups to complexify over time by adding new members through their relationships with existing group members those with negative or 'mixed ' experiences with previous groups will likely be more deliberate in their assessment of potential groups to join , and with which groups they choose to join ( for more , see minimax , as part of social exchange theory ) once a group has begun to form , it can increase membership through a few ways social influence identifies 3 stages of conversion : compliance ( individual will comply or accept group 's views , but not necessarily agree with them ) , identification ( member begins to mimic group 's actions , values , characteristics , etc relationships will develop some stability in these small sets , in that individuals may temporarily change from one set to another , but will return to the same pairs or trios rather consistently and resist change all of this seldom takes place without some conflict or disagreement : for example , fighting over the distribution of resources , the choices of means and different subgoals , the development of what are appropriate norms , rewards and punishments depending on the pressure of the common goal and on the various skills of individuals , differentiations of leadership , dominance , or authority will develop depending on the number of individuals in the original collection of strangers , and the number of '' hangers-on '' that are tolerated , one or more competing groups of ten or less may form , and the competition for territory and dominance will then also be manifested in the inter group transactions not all larger social structures require the cohesion that may be found in the small group the key concept is that the value and success of a group is obtained by each member maintaining a distinct , functioning identity in the minds of each of the members weakening of the common purpose once a group is well established can be attributed to : adding new members ; unsettled conflicts of identities ( i.e often , if a strong common purpose is still present , a simple reorganization with a new leader and a few new members will be sufficient to re-establish the group , which is somewhat easier than forming an entirely new group
