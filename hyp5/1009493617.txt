the details of rameau 's life are generally obscure , especially concerning his first forty years , before he moved to paris for good rameau 's early years are particularly obscure 3 here , in 1706 , he published his earliest known compositions : the harpsichord works that make up his first book of pièces de clavecin , which show the influence of his friend louis marchand in 1722 , he returned to paris for good , and here he published his most important work of music theory , traité de l'harmonie ( treatise on harmony ) new grove rameau took his first tentative steps into composing stage music when the writer alexis piron asked him to provide songs for his popular comic plays written for the paris fairs four collaborations followed , beginning with l'endriague in 1723 ; none of the music has survived 8 in spite of his fame as a music theorist , rameau had trouble finding a post as an organist in paris he had already approached writer antoine houdar de la motte for a libretto in 1727 , but nothing came of it ; he was finally inspired to try his hand at the prestigious genre of tragédie en musique after seeing montéclair 's jephté in 1732 some , such as the composer andré campra , were stunned by its originality and wealth of invention ; others found its harmonic innovations discordant and saw the work as an attack on the french musical tradition in 1731 , rameau became the conductor of la poupelinière 's private orchestra , which was of an extremely high quality 475 la poupelinière 's salon enabled rameau to meet some of the leading cultural figures of the day , including voltaire , who soon began collaborating with the composer 221–23 their first project , the tragédie en musique samson , was abandoned because an opera on a religious theme by voltaire—a notorious critic of the church—was likely to be banned by the authorities 220 meanwhile , rameau had introduced his new musical style into the lighter genre of the opéra-ballet with the highly successful les indes galantes 256 however , the composer followed them with six years of silence , in which the only work he produced was a new version of dardanus ( 1744 ) the reason for this interval in the composer 's creative life is unknown , although it is possible he had a falling-out with the authorities at the académie royale de la musique she had la poupelinière engage the services of the bohemian composer johann stamitz , who succeeded rameau after a breach developed between rameau and his patron ; however , by then , rameau no longer needed la poupelinière 's financial support and protection this was due to be followed by a final tragédie en musique , les boréades ; but for unknown reasons , the opera was never produced and had to wait until the late 20th century for a proper staging rameau appeared revolutionary to the lullyistes , disturbed by complex harmony of his music ; and reactionary to the '' philosophes , '' who only paid attention to its content and who either would not or could not listen to the sound it made the incomprehension rameau received from his contemporaries stopped him from repeating such daring experiments as the second trio des parques in hippolyte et aricie , which he was forced to remove after a handful of performances because the singers had been either unable or unwilling to execute it correctly rameau 's musical works may be divided into four distinct groups , apart from the pieces written for the paris fairs , which have n't survived which differ greatly in importance : a few cantatas ; a few motets for large chorus ; some pieces for solo harpsichord or harpsichord accompanied by other instruments ; and , finally , his works for the stage , to which he dedicated the last thirty years of his career almost exclusively besides , no borrowings have been found from other composers , although his earliest works show the influence of other music for at least 26 years , rameau was a professional organist in the service of religious institutions , and yet the body of sacred music he composed is exceptionally small and his organ works nonexistent 55 and soon taken up by many famous composers of the day , such as montéclair , campra , and clérambault cantatas were rameau 's first contact with dramatic music along with françois couperin , rameau was a master of the 18th-century french school of harpsichord music , and both made a break with the style of the first generation of harpsichordists whose compositions adhered to the relatively standardised suite form , which had reached its apogee in the first decade of the 18th century and successive collections of pieces by louis marchand , gaspard le roux , louis-nicolas clérambault , jean-françois dandrieu , élisabeth jacquet de la guerre , charles dieupart and nicolas siret rameau and couperin had different styles , and it seems they did not know one another : couperin was one of the official court musicians ; rameau , fifteen years his junior , achieved fame only after couperin 's death on a strictly musical level , 18th-century french baroque opera is richer and more varied than contemporary italian opera , especially in the place given to choruses and dances but also in the musical continuity that arises from the respective relationships between the arias and the recitatives another essential difference : whereas italian opera gave a starring role to female sopranos and castrati , french opera had no use for the latter it was during the latter that the action progressed while the audience waited for the next aria ; on the other hand , the text of the arias was almost entirely buried beneath music whose chief aim was to show off the virtuosity of the singer nothing of the kind is to be found in french opera of the day ; since lully , the text had to remain comprehensible—limiting certain techniques such as the vocalise , which was reserved for special words such as ( '' glory '' ) or ( '' victory '' ) even in his earliest works , where he uses the french overture , rameau—the born symphonist and master of orchestration—composes novel and unique pieces arias : less frequent than in italian opera , rameau nevertheless offers many striking examples during the first part of his operatic career ( 1733–1739 ) , rameau wrote his great masterpieces destined for the académie royale de musique : three tragédies en musique and two opéra-ballets that still form the core of his repertoire after the interval of 1740 to 1744 , he became the official court musician , and for the most part , composed pieces intended to entertain , with plenty of dance music emphasising sensuality and an idealised pastoral atmosphere in his last years , rameau returned to a renewed version of his early style in les paladins and les boréades he was highly demanding and bad-tempered , unable to maintain longstanding partnerships with his librettists , with the exception of louis de cahusac , who collaborated with him on several operas , including les fêtes de l'hymen et de l'amour ( 1747 ) , zaïs ( 1748 ) , naïs ( 1749 ) , zoroastre ( 1749 ; revised 1756 ) , la naissance d'osiris ( 1754 ) , and anacréon ( the first of rameau 's operas by that name , 1754 ) he is also credited with writing the libretto of rameau 's final work , les boréades ( c many rameau specialists have regretted that the collaboration with houdar de la motte never took place , and that the samson project with voltaire came to nothing because the librettists rameau did work with were second-rate by the end of his life , rameau 's music had come under attack in france from theorists who favoured italian models however , foreign composers working in the italian tradition were increasingly looking towards rameau as a way of reforming their own leading operatic genre , opera seria for instance , both orfeo and the 1737 version of castor et pollux open with the funeral of one of the leading characters who later comes back to life 201–02 many of the operatic reforms advocated in the preface to gluck 's alceste were already present in rameau 's works 554 so when gluck arrived in paris in 1774 to produce a series of six french operas , he could be seen as continuing in the tradition of rameau 277 for most of the 19th century , rameau 's music remained unplayed , known only by reputation 418 in 1894 , composer vincent d'indy founded the schola cantorum to promote french national music ; the society put on several revivals of works by rameau a detailed comparison allows us to affirm that gluck could replace rameau on the french stage only by assimilating the latter 's beautiful works and making them his own '' camille saint-saëns ( by editing and publishing the pièces in 1895 ) and paul dukas were two other important french musicians who gave practical championship to rameau 's music in their day , but interest in rameau petered out again , and it was not until the late 20th century that a serious effort was made to revive his works operas and stage works ( en ) gavotte with doubles hypermedia by jeff hall & tim smith at the binaural collaborative hypertext – shockwave player required – ( '' gavotte with doubles '' link ng ) ( en ) jp.rameau.free.fr rameau – le site ( fr ) musicologie.org biography , list of works , bibliography , discography , theoretical writings , in french ( en ) jean-philippe rameau / discography magnatune les cyclopes by rameau in on-line mp3 format ( played by trevor pinnock ) jean-philippe rameau , '' l'orchestre de louis xv '' – suites d'orchestre , le concert des nations , dir
