when the northern territory branch of the australian medical association publicly opposed the proposed northern territory legislation to provide for legal euthanasia , nitschke and a small group of dissenting territory doctors published a contrary opinion in the nt news under the banner doctors for change after the rights of the terminally ill act ( roti act ) came into force on 1 july 1996 , nitschke assisted four terminally ill people to end their lives using the euthanasia device he developed after the roti act was nullified nitschke began providing advice to others about how they can end their lives , leading to the formation of exit international in 1997 nitschke made headlines in new zealand when he announced plans to accompany eight new zealanders to mexico where the drug nembutal , capable of producing a fatal overdose , can be purchased legally he also made headlines , even angering some fellow right-to-die advocates , when he presented his plan to launch a '' death ship '' that would have allowed him to circumvent local laws by euthanising people from around the world in international waters although nitschke was unaware of the investigation at the time , he now believes that brayley , whom he described as a '' serial killer '' , had made a rational decision to commit suicide rather than face long imprisonment on 23 july 2014 , as a consequence of the brayley case , the mba voted to use emergency powers to suspend his practitioner 's licence immediately , on the grounds that he presented '' a serious risk to public health and safety '' nitschke said he would appeal the suspension , which he claimed was politically motivated , and that the board '' made it clear that what they really object to is the way i think nitschke said the suspension will not affect his work for exit international and that he had not practised medicine for years in late 2014 the appeal was rejected on the grounds that , although it was accepted that brayley was not nitschke 's patient , the controversial concept of rational suicide was inconsistent with the medical profession 's code of conduct and that , as a medical practitioner providing advice on suicide , he posed a serious risk because people may elect to commit suicide believing it to be a pathway sanctioned by a medical practitioner and perhaps the medical profession generally '' a doctor would constantly need to fear that any interaction with any other individual or community , including an individual who is not and never has been his or her patient , may be in breach of the ( code ) , even if the doctor did nothing in circumstances where there was no other obligation to do something , '' he said in response nitschke , calling the mba 's actions '' a heavy-handed and clumsy attempt to restrict the free flow of information on end-of-life choice '' , surveyed more than 1,000 members of his advocacy group , exit international , and received strong support for ending his medical registration as a consequence of the mba restrictions and the results of the member survey , nitschke publicly burned his medical practising certificate and announced the end of his medical career , vowing to continue to promote euthanasia nitschke stated that he will remain a doctor and will legitimately use the title '' doctor '' ( he has a phd ) , and will continue to see patients and exit members in clinics that he runs in australia and other countries nitschke said it was a matter of free speech and that his detention said something about changes to british society which were '' quite troubling '' however , although assisting someone to commit suicide in the uk was illegal , the law did not apply to a person lecturing on the concept of euthanasia , and nitschke was allowed to enter dame joan bakewell , the british government 's '' voice of older people '' , said that the current british law on assisted suicide was '' a mess '' and that nitschke should have been made more welcome in the uk on 1 august 2014 , after euthanasia advocate max bromson , 66 , who suffered from terminal bone tumor , ended his life with nembutal in a glenelg motel room , surrounded by family members , police carried out a three-hour raid on exit international 's adelaide premises , interrogating nitschke and seizing nitschke 's phones , computers and other items in august 2016 , after exactly two years of investigation , south australian police advised that no charges would be laid against anyone over the death dr nitschke commented that police had made dr henry 's last days on earth a misery and that “ police need to realise that in the uk , suicide is not a crime , and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their life is in need of psychiatric intervention '' , adding that the police action was '' a significant abuse of power against a vulnerable elderly woman '' in may 2018 australian federal police used local police force personnel in different regions of the country to conduct late night raids on the homes of elderly exit members , demanding to know if they had bought the euthanasia drug nembutal in march 2018 , the independent police conduct authority found operation painter to be illegal this coincided with another action by new zealand police in which 76-year old patsy mcgrath , a member of nitschke 's exit group , had her home raided in 2016 and her store-bought helium balloon cylinder confiscated under warrant in july 2009 nitschke said he no longer believed voluntary euthanasia should only be available to the terminally ill , but that elderly people afraid of getting old and incapacitated should also have a choice nitschke expects that a growing number of people importing their own euthanasia drugs , '' really do n't care if the law is changed or not '' '' by and large , palliative care have done pretty well out of the argument over the euthanasia issue , because they are the ones that have argued that they just need better funding and then no one will ever want to die – that 's a lie nitschke acknowledged that the information about the drug that was provided online could be accessed by people below the age of 50 who were not terminally ill , but argued that the risk was necessary in order to help the elderly and the seriously ill in another case lucas taylor , 26 , committed suicide in germany by taking nembutal after soliciting advice at an exit international online forum ( which , according to nitschke , he accessed by claiming his age was 65 ) on 22 may 2009 it was disclosed in the press , citing wikileaks , that the australian government had added the online peaceful pill handbook to the blacklist maintained by the australian communications and media authority used to filter internet access to citizens of australia nitschke said the proposals were the '' final nail in the coffin for euthanasia advocacy '' in australia , where people are banned from discussing end-of-life issues over the phone , buying books about it or importing printed material on it '' in april 2010 nitschke began holding a series of '' hacking masterclasses '' to teach people how to circumvent the australian internet filter on 10 september 2010 nitschke complained that the freetv australia self-regulator of advertising content on australian commercial television had prevented the television screening of a paid advertisement from exit international in which an actor depicted a dying man who requested the option of voluntary euthanasia commercials advice reportedly cited section 2.17.5 of the commercial television code of practice : suicide similar tv commercials , planned for use during nitschke 's canadian lecture tour of 2010 , were likewise banned by the television bureau of canada , after lobbying by anti-euthanasia pressure groups nitschke was told to provide legal advice outlining how his billboard did not break this law , a request nitschke described as '' ludicrous '' , pointing out that the billboards urge '' political change and in no way could be considered to be in breach of the crimes act '' nitschke said the kit was made available by exit international in response to growing demand for something to test the nembutal obtained from mexico , often delivered in the post without labels nitschke stated that the gas cylinders can be used for both brewing and , if required , to end life at a later stage in a '' peaceful , reliable and totally legal '' manner following a 2013 workshop showcasing nitschke 's nitrogen gas product , the ama 's wa branch president and general practitioner , richard choong , said that he was strongly opposed to it , regardless of its technical legality , since '' any machine that can help you kill yourself can be abused , misused and maliciously used '' nitschke 's personal story from his early days , to his activist student days in adelaide , to working with aboriginal land rights groups in australia 's far north ; to his successful campaign to have euthanasia legalised in australia
