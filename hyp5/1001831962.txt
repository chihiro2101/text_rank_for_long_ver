in 1969 , dudley dumonde proposed the term '' lymphokine '' to describe proteins secreted from lymphocytes and later , proteins derived from macrophages and monocytes in culture were called '' monokines '' the widespread distribution of cellular sources for cytokines may be a feature that differentiates them from hormones a contributing factor to the difficulty of distinguishing cytokines from hormones is that some immunomodulating effects of cytokines are systemic rather than local cytokines have been classed as lymphokines , interleukins , and chemokines , based on their presumed function , cell of secretion , or target of action the term interleukin was initially used by researchers for those cytokines whose presumed targets are principally white blood cells ( leukocytes ) lymphokines : produced by lymphocytes monokines : produced exclusively by monocytes interferons : involved in antiviral responses colony stimulating factors : support the growth of cells in semisolid media chemokines : mediate chemoattraction ( chemotaxis ) between cells the il-17 family , which has yet to be completely characterized , though member cytokines have a specific effect in promoting proliferation of t-cells that cause cytotoxic effects a key focus of interest has been that cytokines in one of these two sub-sets tend to inhibit the effects of those in the other the fact that cytokines themselves trigger the release of other cytokines and also lead to increased oxidative stress makes them important in chronic inflammation , as well as other immunoresponses , such as fever and acute phase proteins of the liver ( il-1,6,12 , ifn-a ) in recent years , the cytokine receptors have come to demand the attention of more investigators than cytokines themselves , partly because of their remarkable characteristics and partly because a deficiency of cytokine receptors has now been directly linked to certain debilitating immunodeficiency states in this regard , and also because the redundancy and pleomorphism of cytokines are , in fact , a consequence of their homologous receptors , many authorities think that a classification of cytokine receptors would be more clinically and experimentally useful a classification of cytokine receptors based on their three-dimensional structure has , therefore , been attempted the il-2 receptor belongs to this chain , whose Î³-chain ( common to several other cytokines ) deficiency is directly responsible for the x-linked form of severe combined immunodeficiency ( x-scid ) tumor necrosis factors ( tnf ) ( type 3 ) family , whose members share a cysteine-rich common extracellular binding domain , and includes several other non-cytokine ligands like cd40 , cd27 and cd30 , besides the ligands on which the family is named this may include the upregulation and/or downregulation of several genes and their transcription factors , resulting in the production of other cytokines , an increase in the number of surface receptors for other molecules , or the suppression of their own effect by enzyme inhibitor the effect of a particular cytokine on a given cell depends on the cytokine , its extracellular abundance , the presence and abundance of the complementary receptor on the cell surface , and downstream signals activated by receptor binding ; these last two factors can vary by cell type cytokines are characterized by considerable redundancy , in that many cytokines appear to share similar functions current data suggest cytokine storms may be the source of extensive lung tissue damage and dysfunctional coagulation in covid-19 infections
