rugby 's position on a hill overlooking the avon , made it an ideal location for a defended dobunni watch settlement during the roman period the roman town of tripontium was established on the watling street roman road around north-east of what is now rugby , this was later abandoned when the romans left britain rugby obtained a charter to hold a market in 1255 , and soon developed into a small country market town according to one theory , the stones from the castle were later used to construct the west tower of st andrew 's church , which bears strong resemblance to a castle , and was probably intended for use in a defensive as well as a religious role rugby school was originally intended as a school for local boys , but by the 18th century it had acquired a national reputation and gradually became a mostly fee-paying private school , with most of its pupils coming from outside rugby rugby 's importance and population increased more rapidly during the late 18th and early 19th century due to the growing national reputation of rugby school , which had moved from its original location at a ( now long vanished ) schoolhouse north of st andrew 's church , to its present

history group rugby 's growth was substantially accelerated by the coming of the railways , as its position made it an ideal meeting place for various railway lines , by the middle of the 19th century , the railway junction at rugby had become one of the most important in the country : the first railway arrived in 1838 when one of the earliest inter-city main lines , the london and birmingham railway ( l & br ) was constructed around the town in the later half of the 19th century , rugby also developed some local industries : large-scale cement production began in the town in 1862 when the

years , rugby became well served by the motorway network , with the m1 and m6 merging close to the town the town of rugby , tennessee still exists whittle is commemorated in rugby by a modern sculpture near the town hall dating from 2005 , made by stephen broadbent the modern town of rugby is an amalgamation of the original town with the former villages of bilton , hillmorton , brownsover and newbold-on-avon which were incorporated into rugby in 1932 when the town became a borough , all except brownsover still have their former village centres the town centre is mostly victorian and early 20th century , however a few much older buildings survive , along with some more modern developments rugby was described by nikolaus pevsner as 'butterfieldtown ' allen , geoff , ( 2000 )

of only market place , high street , sheep street , church street , north street and what is now lawrence sheriff street these streets still form the core of the town centre in the victorian and edwardian eras several more shopping streets were added in order to cater for the growing town , including albert street and regent street , the latter of which was built in 1905 , and was intended to be rugby 's main shopping street , although it never achieved this goal a street market is held in the town centre several days a week in recent years several out-of-town retail centres have opened and expanded to the north of the town , including : elliots field retail park , junction 1 retail park and technology drive a new rugby constituency was created , and a new constituency of kenilworth
