sejanus ' grandfather maintained relations with senatorial families through his marriage with terentia , a sister of the wife of gaius maecenas , who was one of emperor augustus ' most powerful political allies it is likely that sejanus ' father strabo came to the attention of augustus through his father 's connection with maecenas this office he carried on dutifully and without incident until the death of augustus in ad 14 little is known about the life sejanus led prior to this date , but according to tacitus , he accompanied gaius caesar , adopted son of augustus , during his campaigns in armenia in 1 bc upon the accession of tiberius in ad 14 , sejanus was appointed prefect of the praetorian guard as the colleague of his father strabo , and began his rise to prominence when strabo was assigned to the governorship of egypt in ad 15 , sejanus became the sole commander of the praetorians and instigated reforms that helped shape the guard into a powerful tool of the principate however this privileged position caused resentment among the senatorial class and the imperial family , in particular earning him the enmity of tiberius ' son drusus julius caesar while his adopted son germanicus restored order in germania , tiberius ' biological son drusus was sent to quell the uprising in pannonia , accompanied by sejanus and two praetorian cohorts tacitus , annals i.24 in part due to what the soldiers believed to be bad omens , drusus quickly managed to restore stability in the army , and publicly put the chief instigators to death tacitus , annals iii.31 in practice it was still sejanus who was the second man in the empire , and he was ambitious to further expand his power suetonius , the lives of twelve caesars , life of claudius 27 when this failed , it seems sejanus turned his attention toward eliminating drusus during an argument drusus had struck the prefect with his fist , and he openly lamented that '' a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor 's son was alive '' tacitus , annals iv.7 tiberius was already in his sixties , thus the possibility of drusus succeeding his father in the near future loomed large the loss of his son was a major blow to tiberius , personally and politically tacitus , annals iii.56 with these hopes now dashed , tiberius left his administration more than ever in the care of sejanus and looked toward the sons of germanicus ( nero caesar , drusus caesar and caligula ) as possible heirs tacitus , annals ii.72 following his death , his wife agrippina the elder returned to rome with their six children and became increasingly involved with a group of senators who opposed the growing power of sejanus her relations with tiberius became increasingly fraught , as she made it clear that she believed that he was responsible for the death of germanicus having divorced apicata two years earlier , he asked to marry drusus ' widow livilla in ad 25 , possibly with an eye towards placing himself , as an adopted julius , in the position of a potential successor tacitus , annals iv.40 alarmed by this sudden denigration , sejanus changed his plans and began to isolate tiberius from rome tacitus , annals iv.41 despite the withdrawal of tiberius from rome 's political scene , the presence of livia seems to have checked sejanus ' overt power for a time tacitus , annals v.3 sejanus began a series of purge trials of senators and wealthy equestrians in the city , removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial ( and his own ) treasury cassius dio , roman history lviii.3 agrippina and two of her sons , nero and drusus were arrested and exiled in ad 30 , and later starved to death in suspicious circumstances the ancient historian cassius dio wrote : sejanus was so great a person by reason both of his excessive haughtiness and of his vast power , that , to put it briefly , he himself seemed to be the emperor and tiberius a kind of island potentate , inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of capreae cassius dio , roman history lviii.5 through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor , sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire modern historians consider it unlikely that sejanus plotted to seize power and , if he had planned so at all , rather might have aimed at overthrowing tiberius to serve as a regent to tiberius gemellus , son of drusus , or possibly caligula it appears that , when tiberius heard to what extent sejanus had already usurper his authority in rome , he immediately took steps to remove him from power cassius dio , roman history lviii.6 he stepped down as consul , forcing sejanus to do the same cassius dio , roman history lviii.7 and conferred an honorary priesthood upon caligula , rekindling popular support for the house of germanicus cassius dio , roman history lviii.8 the ensuing confusion was successful in alienating sejanus from many of his followers when it became obvious to tiberius that support for sejanus was not as strong as the emperor had feared , his next step was to choose naevius sutorius macro , previously prefect of the vigiles ( roman police and fire department ) , to replace sejanus and effect his downfall tacitus , annals iv.11 enraged upon learning the truth , tiberius soon ordered more killings tacitus , annals vi.2 although rome at first rejoiced at the demise of sejanus , the city was quickly plunged into more extensive trials as tiberius persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of sejanus or had courted his friendship most historical documentation of tiberius ' revenge is given by suetonius and tacitus ; their portrayal of a tyrannical , vengeful emperor has been challenged by several modern historians the reality of this was seen in ad 31 , when tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard cassius dio , roman history lviii.14 following his death , the guard began to play an increasingly ambitious and bloody role in the empire suetonius , on the life of the caesars , life of claudius 10 in the late 1st century , a calculated uprising of praetorians against emperor nerva , led by casperius aelianus , forced nerva to adopt the more popular trajan as his son and successor according to sources , the downfall of plautianus was largely due to suspicion of severus ' son caracalla , who was later murdered and replaced by his praetorian prefect marcus opellius macrinus suetonius , on the life of the caesars , life of tiberius 55 tacitus , on the other hand , attributes much of the decline of tiberius ' rule after ad 23 to the corrupting influence of sejanus , although he is generally also harsh on tiberius seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred sejanus ' displeasure for criticising him because he had commissioned a statue of himself sejanus is also a leading figure in another roman history play of about this time , the anonymous tragedy of claudius tiberius nero ( 1607 )
