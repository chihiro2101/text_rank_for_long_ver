a third origin has been cited from galician-portuguese , where marrar means '' to force '' and marrano means '' forced one '' , indicating the compulsory nature of the religious conversions under state pressure in the late 14th and early 15th century , over half of jews in the iberian peninsula converted to christianity , thus avoiding the decree of expulsion which affected spain 's remaining openly jewish population in 1492 martinez gave speeches that led to violence against the jews , and this influence culminated in the sack of the jewish quarter of seville on june 4 , 1391 throughout spain during this year , the cities of ecija , carmona , córdoba , toledo , barcelona and many others saw their jewish quarters destroyed and inhabitants massacred they also attacked the residences of wealthy new christians in the quarter of la magdelena as a result , several prominent converso men were deposed from office , in obedience to a new statute together with prominent conversos fernando and alvaro de la torre , alvar wished to take revenge for an insult by the counts de fuensalida , leaders of the old christians tensions arose in córdoba between old christians and conversos , where they formed two hostile parties the government decreed that jews and conversos should remain in their neighborhood or leave the city without the intervention of the alcalde , andres de cabrera , all new christians might have died at the beginning of the seventeenth century , some conversos who had fled to portugal began to return to spain , fleeing the persecution of the portuguese inquisition , founded in 1536 the government issued an edict directing traditional jews to live within a ghetto and be separated from conversos despite the law , however , the jews remained in communication with their new christian brethren the historian henry kamen 's inquisition and society in spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries questions whether there were such strong links between conversos and jewish communities whilst historians such as yitzhak baer state , '' the conversos and jews were one people '' , although the vast majority of spain 's 250,000 conversos had abandoned judaism and been assimilated into spain 's dominant catholic culture , many of those continuing to secretly practice their former religion felt threatened and persecuted by the inquisition which continued to actively persecute heresy spanish and portuguese conversos also settled at florence and contributed to make livorno a leading seaport at bologna , pisa , naples and numerous other italian cities , they freely exercised the jewish religion again they were soon so numerous that fernando de goes loureiro , an abbot from oporto , filled an entire book with the names of conversos who had drawn large sums from portugal and had openly avowed judaism in italy he granted complete liberty '' to all persons from portugal and algarve , even if belonging to the class of new christians two years later , pope paul iv issued orders to have all the conversos in italy be thrown into the prisons of the inquisition which he had instituted legal emigration to the new world was strictly controlled and required proof of three generations of christian ascendance from 1484 , one town after another had called for expulsion , but the calls were rejected by charles viii however , louis xii , in one of his first acts as king in 1498 , issued a general expulsion order of the jews of provence the jews of provence were given the option of conversion to christianity and a number chose that option in the '' marrano factory : the portuguese inquisition and its new christians 1536-1765 '' , professor antonio jose saraiva of the university of lisbon , writes '' king manuel theoretically abolished discrimination between old and new christians by the law of march 1 , 1507 which permitted the departure of new christians to any part of the christian world , declaring that they “ be considered , favored and treated like the old christians and not distinct and separated from them in any matter ” nevertheless , in apparent contradiction to that law , in a letter dated almeirim , february 18 , 1519 , king manuel promoted legislation henceforth prohibiting the naming of new christians to the position of judge , town councilor or municipal registrar in goa , stipulating , however , that those already appointed were not to be dismissed this shows that even during the first nine years of portuguese rule , goa had a considerable influx of recently baptized spanish and portuguese jews '' some new christians sought to re-join jewish populations in india ( particularly through the jewish community in cochin ) , while others went on to be extremely influential in the spice trade , and the gems trade between portugal , and india during this period , the first bishop of goa , gaspar jorge de leão pereira wrote his anti-semitic work '' contra os judeos '' ( tracts against jews ) , and called for the establishment of the goa inquisition ( which was established in 1560 ) conversos from flanders , and others direct from the iberian peninsula , went under the guise of catholics to hamburg and altona about 1580 , where they established a community and held commercial relations with their former homes christian iv of denmark invited some new christian families to settle at glückstadt about 1626 , granting certain privileges to them and to conversos who came to emden about 1649 the vast majority of spain 's conversos , however , remained in spain and portugal and were suspected of '' marranism '' by the spanish inquisition although the wealthier among them could easily bypass discriminatory limpieza de sangre laws , they constituted a significant portion of the over three thousand people executed for heresy by the spanish inquisition in his luminous book the '' marrano factory : the portuguese inquisition and its new christians 1536-1765 '' , professor antonio jose saraiva of the university of lisbon , writes that '' after august 1531 , when the establishment of the inquisition in portugal was in the offing and especially after june 14 , 1532 when new christian emigration from portugal became a capital offense , anti-new christian sentiment surged on all sides '' the new christians breathed more freely when philip iii of spain came to the
