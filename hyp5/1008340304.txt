lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times several species have appeared in the works of dioscorides , pliny the elder and theophrastus although the studies are not very deep during the first centuries of the modern age they were usually put forward as examples of spontaneous generation and their reproductive mechanisms were totally ignored some forty years later dillenius in his historia muscorum made the first division of the group created by tournefort separating the sub-families usnea , coralloides and lichens in response to the morphological characteristics of the lichen thallus after the revolution in taxonomy brought in by linnaeus and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the plant kingdom forming a single group lichen with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the thallus the taxonomy of lichens was first intensively investigated by the sweden botanist erik acharius ( 1757â€“1819 ) , who is therefore sometimes named the '' father of lichenology '' over the years research is shedding new light into the nature of these organisms still classified as plants in these years a group of researchers faithful to the tenets of linnaeus considered that lichens reproduced sexually and had sexual reproductive organs , as in other plants , independent of whether asexual reproduction also occurred in these early years of structuring the new discipline various works of outstanding scientific importance appeared such as lichenographia europaea reformata published in 1831 by elias fries or enumeratio critico lichenum europaeorum 1850 by ludwig schaerer in germany scientific publications settled many unknown facts about lichens it was also established that algae could associate with many different fungi to form different lichen phenotypes in 1909 the russian lichenologist konstantin mereschkowski presented a research paper '' the theory of two plasms as the basis of symbiogenesis , a new study on the origin of organisms '' , which aims to explain a new theory of symbiogenesis by lichens and other organisms as evidenced by his earlier work '' nature and origin of chromatophores in the plant kingdom '' despite the above studies the dual nature of lichens remained no more than a theory until in 1939 the swiss researcher eugen a thomas species : eugen a lichenology has found applications beyond biology itself in the field of geology in a technique known as lichenometry where the age of an exposed surface can be found by studying the age of lichens growing on them miguel mateo garcia , the growth curve of rhizocarpon geographicum in the valley of madriu andorra , biophysical processes in cold media lichenometry relies upon the fact that the maximum diameter of the largest thallus of an epilithic lichen growing on a substrate is directly proportional to the time from first exposure of the area to the environment as seen in studies by roland beschel in 1950 and is especially useful in areas exposed for less than 1000 years the difficulty of giving a definition applicable to every known lichen has been debated since lichenologists first recognised the dual nature of lichens this researcher represents one of the main trends among lichenologists who consider it impossible to give a single definition to lichens since they are a unique type of organism today studies in lichenology are not restricted to the description and taxonomy of lichens but have application in various scientific fields especially important are studies on environmental quality that are made through the interaction of lichens with their environment although several species of lichen have been used in traditional medicine it was not until the early 20th century that modern science became interested in them bustinza , francisco ( 1948 ) '' contribution to the study of antibiotics produced by lichens '' these studies revealed some in vitro antitumour activity by substances identified in two common lichens peltigera leucophlebia and collema flaccidum
