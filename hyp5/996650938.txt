not far into the play , an elderly man claiming to be the real baron interrupts the show , protesting its many inaccuracies over the complaints of the audience , the theatre company and jackson , the '' real '' baron gains the house 's attention and narrates through flashback an account of one of his adventures , of a life-or-death wager with the grand turk , where the younger baron 's life is saved only by his amazing luck plus the assistance of his remarkable associates : berthold , the world 's fastest runner ; adolphus , a rifleman with superhuman eyesight ; gustavus , who possesses extraordinary hearing , and sufficient lung power to knock down an army by exhaling ; and the fantastically strong albrecht an emotional public funeral takes place , but the denouement reveals that this is merely the final scene of yet another story the baron is telling to the same theater-goers in the city the baron calls the foregoing '' only one of the many occasions on which i met my death '' and closes his tale by saying '' everyone who had a talent for it lived happily ever after '' '' similarly kent houston , head of peerless camera doing the film 's special effects said in madness and misadventures that they were promised a bonus if they would finish the effects in time , but when they approached the person again when they were done , he was met with the reply , '' i 'm not gon na pay you , because i do n't want to seem to be doing anything that could benefit terry gilliam gilliam explains that , '' the one theme that runs through all three of these pictures is a consistently serious battle between fantasy and what people perceive as reality go and see them by all means - but to be in them , fucking madness ! ! ! '' sarah polley , who was nine years old at the time of filming , described it as a traumatic experience often the best ideas have come out of something not working properly and coming up with a new concept as a result in madness and misadventures , robin williams commented on the low number of release prints that columbia produced , saying '' puttnam 's regime was leaving , the new one was going through this , and they said , 'this was their movies , now let 's do our movies ! ' it was a bit like the new lion that comes in and kills all the cubs from the previous man '' he compared the film 's budget problems to the even more serious problems of we 're no angels that commonly go unmentioned , and he went on to declare its difficulties as a mixture of '' trade press '' still being upset about gilliam 's battle with universal over brazil , nepotism , and an intrigue on behalf of ray stark successfully trying to have puttnam removed from columbia , coupled with the fact the studio was being sold at the time : the negative stories about the shoot that were turning up in the hollywood press were coming , we found out later , from a source at film finances–which was the completion bond company on the film i thought it was quite extraordinary , because the stories were doing two things – they were making me and the whole project look like it was completely out of control and all my fault , and that film finance , the completion guarantors , were the only thing holding it together–the people trying to bring control to it the ultimate fact was that when the film was ultimately released , there were only 117 prints made for america – so it was never really released we were ultimately the victim of columbia tri-star being sold to sony , because at that time all they were doing was trying to get the books looking as good as possible they were burying films left right and center by spending no money on them–and the books looked really good at the end of that the joke is , if you look back , we got the best reviews and we were doing the best business in the opening weeks of any film they had released since last emperor we actually opened well in the big cities–we opened really well a friend who had bought the video rights said he had never seen anything so weird–columbia was spending their whole time looking at exit polls to prove the film would not work in the suburbs , and so it would be pointless to make any more prints regarding the obvious gap between the movie 's troubled production and its eventual triumph of aesthetic cinematic form on the screen , jeff swindoll wrote in his 2008 dvd review of munchausen for monsters and critics : '' for the absolute hell that the production of the film turned out to be , you really do n't see any of that tension on the screen while considering the film 's special effects as '' astonishing '' , ebert also contended '' the movie is slow to get off the ground '' and '' sometimes the movie fails on the basic level of making itself clear additionally , ebert considered john neville 's title role performance as appearing '' sensible and matter-of-fact , as anyone would if they had spent a lifetime growing accustomed to the incredible '' the washington post called the film a '' wondrous feat of imagination '' , though '' except for williams , the actors are never more than a detail in gilliam 's compositions '' the film was nominated for four british academy film awards , winning three : best costume design best make up artist best production design and losing best special effects to back to the future part ii
