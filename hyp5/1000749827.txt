in his famous '' i am prepared to die '' speech , mandela outlined the motivations which led to the formation of the umkhonto we sizwe : at the beginning of june 1961 , after a long and anxious assessment of the south african situation , i , and some colleagues , came to the conclusion that as violence in this country was inevitable , it would be unrealistic and wrong for african leaders to continue preaching peace and non-violence at a time when the government met our peaceful demands with force we shall not submit and we have no choice but to hit back by all means in our power in defence of our people , our future , and our freedom firstly , we believed that as a result of government policy , violence by the african people had become inevitable , and that unless responsible leadership was given to canalise and control the feelings of our people , there would be outbreaks of terrorism which would produce an intensity of bitterness and hostility between the various races of this country which is not produced even by war we first broke the law in a way which avoided any recourse to violence ; when this form was legislated against , and then the government resorted to a show of force to crush opposition to its policies , only then did we decide to answer with violence in june 1961 , mandela sent a letter to south african newspapers warning the government that a campaign of sabotage would be launched unless the government agreed to call for a national constitutional convention in december 1962 , looksmart ngudle and denis goldberg helped to organise a training camp held at mamre , outside cape town , later recognised as the first mk training centre inside south africa ; however it had to be abandoned early due to security police interest the early 1970s were a low point for the anc in many ways , including in the military sphere attempts to rebuild umkhonto we sizwe inside south africa resulted in many losses , though some members , including chris hani , were able to remain undetected for a long period in a submission to the truth and reconciliation commission ( trc ) , the anc stated that zondo 's act , though '' understandable '' as a response to a recent south african defence force raid in lesotho , was not in line with anc policy the armed struggle continued with attacks on a series of soft targets , including a bank in roodepoort in 1988 , in which four civilians were killed and 18 injured this was particularly true in the period of 1979–1989 , although torture was not official anc policy the trc also noted in its report that although '' anc had , in the course of the conflict , contravened the geneva protocols and was responsible for the commission of gross human rights violations…of the three main parties to the south african conflict , only the anc committed itself to observing the tenets of the geneva protocols and , in the main , conducting the armed struggle in accordance within the international humanitarian law '' furthermore , mk 's prestige inside south africa was greatly enhanced by its participation in a conventional battle , and apparent willingness to directly confront a south african military force following the soweto uprising large numbers of young south africans fled the country and joined the anc and mk , seeking the opportunity to fight back at the apartheid state initially the experience in angolan training camps was positive but over time frustration that the numbers being sent back to south africa was low and that conditions in the camps were often poor grew after mk cadres were asked by oliver tambo to join the angolan war against unita and found that the angolans were often poorly trained and indisciplined frustration turned to mutiny , and in some cases open military conflict inside the training camps themselves a combined mk-zipra force was largely eliminated by the rhodesian security forces during operation nickel , and the survivors driven back across the border into botswana and zambia this close alliance is the first of its kind one can recall in the liberation movement in no previous instance has there actually been fighting by freedom fighters drawn from different territories day of reconciliation internal resistance to apartheid south african border war military history of south africa necklacing '' the turn to sabotage by the congress movement in south africa
