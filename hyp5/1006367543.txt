a particular system ’ s characteristics may make it better-suited for various , sometimes contradictory applications , including document retrieval , linguistic analysis , easy readability , faithful representation of pronunciation source , or donor language – a system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language , or a series of languages , or for any language in a particular writing system a language-specific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation , while the general one may be better for cataloguing international texts target , or receiver language – most systems are intended for an audience that speaks or reads a particular language ) simplicity – since the basic latin alphabet has a smaller number of letters than many other writing systems , digraphs , diacritics , or special characters must be used to represent them all in latin script if the romanization attempts to transliterate the original script , the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of characters in the source language into the target script , with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader 's language for example , the nihon-shiki romanization of japanese allows the informed reader to reconstruct the original japanese kana syllables with 100 % accuracy , but requires additional knowledge for correct pronunciation a phonetic conversion goes one step further and attempts to depict all phones in the source language , sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions not found in the target script pure transcriptions are generally not possible , as the source language usually contains sounds and distinctions not found in the target language , but which must be shown for the romanized form to be comprehensible in modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language , written foreign language , written native language , spoken ( read ) native language as an example , consider the japanese martial art 柔術 : the nihon-shiki romanization zyûzyutu may allow someone who knows japanese to reconstruct the kana syllables , but most native english speakers , or rather readers , would find it easier to guess the pronunciation from the hepburn version , jujutsu qalam ( 1985 ) : a system that focuses upon preserving the spelling , rather than the pronunciation , and uses mixed case iso 233-2 ( 1993 ) : simplified transliteration the devanagari-specific portion is very similar to the academic standard , iast : '' international alphabet of sanskrit transliteration '' , and to the united states library of congress standard , ala-lc , although there are a few differences the national library at kolkata romanization , intended for the romanization of all indic scripts , is an extension of iast harvard-kyoto : uses upper and lower case and doubling of letters , to avoid the use of diacritics , and to restrict the range to 7-bit ascii however , in practice the situation is , in pakistan : standard ( saaf or khaalis ) urdu is the '' high '' variety , whereas hindustani is the '' low '' variety used by the masses ( called urdu , written in nastaʿlīq script ) the news international - dec 29 , 2011 -- '' hamari boli ( our language ) is perhaps one of the very first serious undertakings to explore , develop and encourage the growth of roman script in the use of urdu/hindi language the system is also used in other chinese-speaking areas such as singapore and parts of taiwan , and has been adopted by much of the international community as a standard for writing chinese words and names in the latin script the value of hanyu pinyin in education in china lies in the fact that china , like any other populated area with comparable area and population , has numerous distinct dialects , though there is just one common written language and one common standardized spoken form technically this represented a largely phonemic transcription system , as min nan was not commonly written in chinese see also comparison of hokkien writing systems not strictly a system , but a collection of common practices that enables input of japanese text while romanization has taken various and at times seemingly unstructured forms , some sets of rules do exist : mccune–reischauer ( mr ; 1937 ? ) , the first transcription to gain some acceptance although mostly irrelevant when transcribing uninflected words , these aberrations are so widespread that any mention of '' mccune-reischauer romanization '' may not necessarily refer to the original system as published in the 1930s several problems with mr led to the development of the newer systems : yale ( 1942 ) : this system has become the established standard romanization for korean among linguists while the spanish language itself uses a very phonemic spelling , the romanised spelling created for philippine languages is even more so bgn/pcgn romanization of belarusian , 1979 ( united states board on geographic names and permanent committee on geographical names for british official use ) scientific transliteration , or the international scholarly system for linguistics ala-lc romanization , 1997 ( american library association and library of congress ) : iso 9:1995 instruction on transliteration of belarusian geographical names with letters of latin script , 2000 a system based on scientific transliteration and iso/r 9:1968 was considered official in bulgaria since the 1970s since the late 1990s , bulgarian authorities have switched to the so-called streamlined system avoiding the use of diacritics and optimized for compatibility with english there is no single universally accepted system of writing russian using the latin script—in fact there are a huge number of such systems : some are adjusted for a particular target language ( e.g ala-lc ( 1997 ) volapuk encoding ( 1990s ) : slang term ( it 's not really volapük ) for a writing method that 's not truly a transliteration , but used for similar goals ( see article ) conventional english transliteration is based to bgn/pcgn , but does n't follow a particular standard the latin script for syriac was developed in the 1930s , following the state policy for minority languages of the soviet union , with some material published pedersen 's comparison of five systems see also : ukrainian latin alphabet the chart below shows the most common phonemic transcription romanization used for several different alphabets
