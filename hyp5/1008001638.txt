13 though eduard schwartz takes the view that sallust 's birthplace was rome 12 because of this sallust could have been raised in rome he received a very good education after an ill-spent youth , sallust entered public life and may have won election as quaestor in 55 bc however , there is no conclusive evidence about this , and some scholars suppose that sallust did not become a quaestor — the practice of violating the cursus honorum was common in the last years of the republic 247 from the beginning of his public career , sallust operated as a decided partisan of julius caesar , to whom he owed such political advancement as he attained sallust then retired from public life and devoted himself to historical literature , and further developed his gardens , upon which he spent much of his accumulated wealth sallust 's account of the catiline conspiracy ( de coniuratione catilinae or bellum catilinae ) and of the jugurthine war ( bellum jugurthinum ) have come down to us complete , together with fragments of his larger and most important work ( historiae ) , a history of rome from 78 to 67 bc , intended as a continuation of cornelius sisenna 's work this is sallust 's first published work , an account of the attempt by lucius sergius catalina ( catiline ) to overthrow the roman republic in the year 63 bc in writing about the conspiracy of catiline , sallust 's tone , style , and descriptions of aristocratic behavior show that he was deeply troubled by the moral decline of rome the work probably was written between 44 and 40 bc , mellor , r according to him , the conspiracy was prepared by sallust in 50 bc as a political pamphlet , but was not published ; after the civil war sallust reviewed and finally published it : mackay , l 190 the work does not show any traces of personal experience , and the most common explanation is that sallust was absent from rome on military service during this period its true value lies in the introduction of marius and sulla to the roman political scene and the beginning of their rivalry sallust 's time as governor of africa nova ought to have let the author develop a solid geographical and ethnographical background to the war ; however , this is not evident in the monograph , despite a diversion on the subject , because sallust 's priority in the jugurthine war , as with the catiline conspiracy , is to use history as a vehicle for his judgement on the slow destruction of roman morality and politics the extant fragments of the histories ( some discovered in 1886 ) show sufficiently well the political partisan , who took a keen pleasure in describing the reaction against sulla 's policy and legislation after the dictator 's death two letters ( duae epistolae de republica ordinanda ) , letters of political counsel and advice addressed to caesar , and an attack upon cicero ( invectiva or declamatio in ciceronem ) , frequently attributed to sallust , are thought by modern scholars to have come from the pen of a rhetorician of the first century ad , along with a counter-invective attributed to cicero at one time marcus porcius latro was considered a candidate for the authorship of the pseudo-sallustian corpus , but this view is no longer commonly held the style of works written by sallust was well known in rome it differs from the writings of his contemporaries — caesar and especially cicero as a result , his works are very far from the conversational latin of his time on famous grammarians and rhetoricians , 10 ronald syme suggests that sallust 's choice of style and even particular words was influenced by his antipathy to cicero , his rival , but also one of the trendsetters in latin literature in the first century bc 257 '' the conspiracy of catiline '' reflects many features of style that were developed in his later works some words used by sallust ( for example , antecapere , portatio , incruentus , incelebratus , incuriosus ) , are not known in other writings before him martial joins the praise : '' sallust , according to the judgment of the learned , will rank as the prince of roman historiographers '' his books were sometimes used by authors of the first and second centuries ad , especially after imitations of archaic style gained popularity 47 in the second century ad zenobius translated his works into ancient greek noctes atticae , x , 26 though quintilian has a generally favorable opinion of sallust , he disparages several features of his style : sallust struck out practically a new line in literature for himself : his predecessors had been little better than mere dry-as-dust chroniclers , but he endeavoured to explain the connection and meaning of events and successfully delineated character the contrast between his early life and the high moral tone he adopted in his writings has frequently made him a subject of reproach , but history gives no reason why he should not have reformed during the late antiquity and early middle ages his works retained their popularity , and some influential early christian theologists ( marcus minucius felix and augustine of hippo ) knew his writings well 505 in the middle ages sallust 's works were often used in schools to teach latin '' princeps historiae romanae : sallust in renaissance political thought '' , memoirs of the american academy in rome 40 ( 1995 ) , p 104 during the late middle ages and renaissance sallust 's works began to influence political thought in italy '' princeps historiae romanae : sallust in renaissance political thought '' , memoirs of the american academy in rome , 40 ( 1995 ) , p 106 during the french wars of religion , de coniuratione catilinae became widely known as a tutorial on disclosing conspiracies several manuscripts of his works survived due to his popularity in antiquity and the middle ages the creator of this manuscript changed the original word order and replaced archaisms with more familiar words the '' v '' scroll also includes two anonymous letters to caesar probably from sallust , but their authenticity is debated ( see above ) many ancient authors cited sallust , and sometimes their citations of histories are the only source for reconstruction of this work
