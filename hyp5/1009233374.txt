this species is patchily distributed through much of africa , though it is absent from much of the central and western parts of the continent and declining elsewhere in its range more so than many other african vultures , they often find carrion on their own and start tearing through the skin perhaps more than any other true vulture , lappet-faced vultures have been recorded as regularly feeding on freshly killed smaller mammals , birds and reptiles some of these are probably road-kills or are pirated from eagles or other raptors but they are also believed to occasionally attack live animals , especially young and weak animals and the nests and young of other birds most remains found at nests are from small animals possibly caught alive they do not nest in cohesive colonies as do many smaller vultures , with one tree or area usually only having one to two nests in it , though rarely up to 10 nests have been recorded in one area the home range of a lappet-faced vulture is usually at least groups of up to 25 to 50 lappet-faces may congregate at large carcasses or watering holes , though typically only from one to as many as seven turn up per carcass nests are almost always placed in the main fork or top of an acacia tree , though balanites and terminalia trees are sometimes also used , at off the ground the lappet-faced vultures does not usually breed until it is around six years of age the declines are almost entirely due to human activities , including disturbances from habitat destruction and cultivation , disturbances at the nesting site ( to which the species is reportedly quite sensitive ) and ingestion of pesticides , which are usually set out for jackals and other small mammalian carnivores domestic cattle , who have replaced natural prey over much of the range , are now often sold off , rather than abandoned , due to the proliferation of markets and abattoirs and rarely left to die and be consumed by vultures
