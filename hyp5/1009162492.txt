digital and analog differ in both the methods of transfer and storage , as well as the behavior exhibited by the systems due to these methods typically , a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter may have a dynamic range of between 90 and 95 & nbsp ; db , whereas the signal-to-noise ratio ( roughly the equivalent of dynamic range , noting the absence of quantization noise but presence of tape hiss ) of a professional reel-to-reel ¼-inch tape recorder would be between 60 and 70 & nbsp ; db at the recorder 's rated output the benefits of using digital recorders with greater than 16-bit accuracy can be applied to the 16 bits of audio cd there are some differences in the behaviour of analog and digital systems when high level signals are present , where there is the possibility that such signals could push the system into overload in contrast , digital pcm recorders show non-benign behaviour in overload ; samples that exceed the peak quantization level are simply truncated , clipping the waveform squarely , which introduces distortion in the form of large quantities of higher-frequency harmonics the opposite is usually true of analog systems , where distortion tends to increase at high signal levels with many recordings , high level distortions at signal peaks may be audibly masked by the original signal , thus large amounts of distortion may be acceptable at peak signal levels the difference between analog and digital systems is the form of high-level signal error it is usually a design goal of digital systems to limit high-level signals to prevent overload therefore , no such media deterioration takes place , and the cd will , with proper care , sound exactly the same every time it is played ( discounting aging of the player and cd itself ) ; however , this is a benefit of the optical system , not of digital recording , and the laserdisc format enjoys the same non-contact benefit with analog optical signals ( sound could , however , be stored on an m-disc dvd-r using the dvd-audio format the amount of noise that a piece of audio equipment adds to the original signal can be quantified with digital systems , the quality of reproduction depends on the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion steps , and does not depend on the quality of the recording medium , provided it is adequate to retain the digital values without error digital media capable of bit-perfect storage and retrieval have been commonplace for some time , since they were generally developed for software storage which has no tolerance for error the 16-bit digital system of red book audio cd has 2 16 65,536 possible signal amplitudes , theoretically allowing for an snr of 98 & nbsp ; db wow ( recording ) are a change in frequency of an analog device and are the result of mechanical imperfections , with wow being a slower rate form of flutter for digital systems , the upper limit of the frequency response is determined by the sampling frequency the bandwidth provided by the 44,100 hz sampling frequency used by the red book ( cd standard ) is sufficiently wide to cover the entire human hearing range , which roughly extends from 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz some analog tape manufacturers specify frequency responses up to 20 & nbsp ; khz , but these measurements may have been made at lower signal levels the low frequency response of vinyl records is restricted by rumble noise ( described above ) , as well as the physical and electrical characteristics of the entire pickup arm and transducer assembly digital systems require that all high frequency signal content above the nyquist frequency must be removed prior to sampling , which , if not done , will result in these ultrasound frequencies '' folding over '' into frequencies which are in the audible range , producing a kind of distortion called aliasing however , designing an analog filter which precisely removes all frequency content exactly above or below a certain cutoff frequency , is impractical early digital systems may have suffered from a number of signal degradations related to the use of analog anti-aliasing filters , e.g showed that music signals with frequency components above 20 & nbsp ; khz were only distinguished from those without by a few of the 176 test subjects ( 2004 ) concluded that '' no significant difference was found between sounds with and without very high frequency components among the sound stimuli and the subjects '' in blind listening tests conducted by bob katz in 1996 , recounted in his book mastering audio : the art and the science , subjects using the same high-sample-rate reproduction equipment could not discern any audible difference between program material identically filtered to remove frequencies above 20 & nbsp ; khz versus 40 & nbsp ; khz numbers on computers represent a finite set of discrete values , which means that if an analog signal is digitally sampled using native methods ( without dither ) , the amplitude of the audio signal will simply be rounded to the nearest representation this form of distortion , sometimes called granular or quantization distortion , has been pointed to as a fault of some digital systems and recordings particularly some early digital recordings , where the digital release was said to be inferior to the analog version the level of the noise depends on the number of the bits in the channel this is called the resolution , and is usually referred to as the bit depth in the context of pcm audio the redbook cd standard uses 16 bits , which keeps the quantization noise 96 & nbsp ; db below maximum amplitude , far below a discernible level with almost any source material consequently , the accuracy to which the original signal can be preserved is instead limited by the intrinsic noise-floor and maximum signal level of the media and the playback equipment optimal use of dither has the effect of making quantization error independent of the signal , and allows signal information to be retained below the least significant bit of the digital system one aspect that may degrade the performance of a digital system is jitter other sources of jitter within digital electronic circuits are data-induced jitter , where one part of the digital stream affects a subsequent part as it flows through the system , and power supply induced jitter , where noise from the power supply causes irregularities in the timing of signals in the circuits it powers it has been shown that a random jitter of 5 & nbsp ; ns may be significant for 16 bit digital systems after initial recording , it is common for the audio signal to be altered in some way , such as with the use of compression , equalization , delays and reverb because the variables involved can be precisely specified in the calculations , digital filters can be made to objectively perform better than analog components plug-in parameters can be stored on the computer , whereas parameter details on an analog unit must be written down or otherwise recorded if the unit needs to be reused the most common form of subjective test is a listening test , where the audio component is simply used in the context for which it was designed early digital audio machines had disappointing results , with digital converters introducing errors that the ear could detect at any point in time , the amplitude of the original analog signal is represented by the relative preponderance of 1 's over 0 's in the data stream the dvd-audio format uses standard , linear pcm at variable sampling rates and bit depths , which at the very least match and usually greatly surpass those of a standard cd audio ( 16 bits , 44.1 & nbsp ; khz ) in the popular hi-fi press , it had been suggested that linear pcm '' creates a stress reaction in people '' , and that dsd '' is the only digital recording system that does not while the words analog audio usually imply that the sound is described using a continuous time/continuous amplitudes approach in both the media and the reproduction/recording systems , and the words digital audio imply a discrete time/discrete amplitudes approach , there are methods of encoding audio that fall somewhere between the two , e.g while not as common as '' pure analog '' or '' pure digital '' methods , these situations do occur in practice continuous amplitude , discrete time systems have also been used in many early analog-to-digital converters , in the form of sample-and-hold circuits although those '' hybrid '' techniques are usually more common in telecommunications systems than in consumer audio , their existence alone blurs the distinctive line between certain digital and analog systems , at least for what regards some of their alleged advantages or disadvantages there are many benefits to using digital recording over analog recording because “ numbers are more easily manipulated than are grooves on a record or magnetized particles on a tape ”
