the primary source for the battle is the chronicle of 754 , which was written shortly after 754 probably in the vicinity of toledo roger collins ( 1989 ) , the arab conquest of spain , 710 & ndash ; 97 ( london : blackwell publishing ) , 26 & ndash ; 27 , argues for its toledan provenance , but others have suggested córdoba or even syria the only other latin christian source written within a century of the battle is the historia langobardorum of paul the deacon several later latin christian sources contain descriptive accounts of the battle that have sometimes been trusted by historians , most notably the chronicle of alfonso iii , written by alfonso iii of asturias in the late ninth century besides the latin christian sources there are several arabic language sources widely used by historians , but increasingly coming under heavy criticism ( 1922 ) , the history of the conquest of egypt , north africa and spain : known as the futūh miṣr of ibn ʿabd al-ḥakam ( yale university press ) ; also john harris jones , trans this account , more rich in detail than the mozarabic chronicle , is at odds with not only the later latin histories , but also the later arabic ones : the anonymous compilation called the akhbār majmūʿa , the late tenth-century work of ibn al-qūṭiyya ( '' the son i.e for an assessment of the value of these sources for the period of the conquest of gothic hispania , see collins ( 1989 ) , 1 & ndash ; 5 the akhbar majmu'ah in particular was upheld by claudio sánchez-albornoz as a genuine eighth-century work surviving only in later copies , but this view has since been refuted archaeological evidence and two surviving lists of kings show that one achila ii ruled in the northeast of the kingdom at this time , but his relationship to roderic is unknown some later arabic and christian sources present an earlier raid by a certain ṭārif in 710 and one , the ad sebastianum recension of the chronicle of alfonso iii , refers to an arab attack incited by erwig during the reign of wamba ( 672 & ndash ; 80 ) for the others that accompanied ṭāriq & mdash ; abdelmelic , alcama , and mugheith & mdash ; see dykes shaw ( 1906 ) , '' the fall of the visigothic power in spain '' , the english historical review , 21:82 ( april ) , 222 later arabic sources state that mūsā only went to hispania after news of ṭāriq 's success reached him he flogged his subordinate in front of his soldiers and then the two together completed the conquest of the peninsula before mūsā was recalled by the caliph to damascus , a fact confirmed by the mozarabic chronicle there is also the record of a byzantine attack on southern iberia that was repulsed by theudimer some years before the fall of the visigothic kingdom this has led to theories that the berber attacks may have been related to the byzantine operation , and that perhaps the arabs were originally useful allies in a byzantine attempt to reconquer the lost province of spania thompson , 250 , is explicit that nothing is known of the context of these byzantine raids he also identified two invasions , the first by an abu zubra and the second , a year later , by ṭāriq ; probably he has divided the historical figure ṭāriq ibn ziyad into two persons the date of the battle is traditionally 711 , though this is not the date given by the mozarabic chronicle if this discrepancy is solved by preferring the chronicler 's order to his dating , then the battle occurred in 712 and the fall of toledo later that same year later arabic accounts give an exact date of 25 or 26 july some accounts say the battle began on the 19th and lasted one week the earliest christian source , and the nearest source in time to the events , says that it took place near the unidentified '' transductine promontories '' ( transductinis promonturiis ) the armies that met in battle on the day that decided the fate of the gothic kingdom in spain are not reliably described in the surviving records this number is outrageously high ; it complements the figure of 187,000 for the muslims provided by the ad sebastianum version of the chronicle of alfonso iii the visigothic forces were '' probably not much larger '' , and the visigothic kingdom was , unlike francia to its north , not organised for war a small number of elite clans ( perhaps around twenty five ) , their warrior followings , the king and his personal following , and the forces that could be raised from the royal fisc constituted the troops upon which roderic could draw the defeat of the visigothic army followed on the flight of the king 's opponents , who had only accompanied the host '' in rivalry '' , '' deceitfully '' , and '' out of ambition to rule '' says the mozarabic chronicler according to rafael altamira y crevea , the '' connexion between the muslims and the sons of wittiza is confirmed by all the chroniclers , and forms a trustworthy starting-point for the history of the invasion , '' cited in bachrach ( 1973 ) , 33n86 , who finds it tempting to place the muslims , the native jewry , and achila ii , whom he reckons a son of wittza , in a tripartite alliance against roderic the later arabic historians universally credit their religion for the victory al-maqqarī , in the breath of perfumes , places in the mouth of ṭāriq a morale-boosting address to his soldiers on the eve of battle , which closes with this exhortation to kill roderic : according to later traditions , indigenous iberian jews , progressively disenfranchised under the rule of christian monarchs and bishops , wolfram drews ( 2002 ) , '' jews as pagans ? polemical definitions of identity in visigothic spain '' , early medieval europe , 11 ( 3 ) , 189 & ndash ; 207 , provides a good overview of the treatment of the jews in spain for the involvement of the church , and especially of julian of toledo , in the jewish persecutions of the late seventh century , see francis x bachrach ( 1977 ) , early medieval jewish policy in western europe ( minneapolis : university of minnesota press ) , 23 & ndash ; 25 , deduces reasons from later medieval christian chroniclers for believing roderic 's predecessor wittiza to have been mild in his policies towards the jews , thus provoking opposition this view was influentially expounded in english by the presbyterian reverend dykes shaw ( 1906 ) , '' the fall of the visigothic power in spain '' , the english historical review , 21:82 ( april ) , 209 & ndash ; 228 among the legends which have accrued to the history of the battle , the most prominent is that of count julian , who , in revenge for the impregnation of his daughter florinda ( the later cava rumía or doña cava ) by roderic while the young woman was being raised at the palace school , supposedly lent ṭāriq the necessary ships for launching an invasion shaw , 221 , writing in 1906 , rejects this as legend from the late ninth- and tenth-century arabic histories according to one interpretation of the urban-julian legend , he was a byzantine governor of ceuta who joined with the arabs to raid the southern coasts of iberia in 710 with ṭārif history of the conquest of spain by the arab-moors : with a sketch of the civilization which they achieved and imparted to europe ( boston : little , brown , & company , 1881 )
