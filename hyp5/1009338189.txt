the macon braves would serve as the last time the city would host a major-league affiliated minor league team during their inaugural season in rome , the team started the first half of the 2003 south atlantic league season with a 36–33 record , finishing 4th in the southern division and well outside the playoff spot won by hickory the second half featured a much better effort , with help from two future braves fan-favorites in brian mccann and jeff francoeur , and rome got to a 42–38 record to win the southern division in the 2nd half of the season and advance to the playoffs for the 1st time ever in rome , and the 6th time overall since the original inception of the team in anderson in 1980 not only was it a historic first season in rome by just making it to the playoffs , but the rome braves followed this with 2–1 series win over hickory to advance to their first ever south atlantic league championship , where they met the lake county captains after their first team championship in 2003 , the following two seasons under rocket wheeler saw the team finish with a 70–70 record in 2004 , and a 72–65 record in 2005 , though neither were able to replicate the similar success of either a championship or even a divisional crown ingle would leave the team for the 2011 season , being sent down to manage the rookie league danville braves , however ingle would return to rome in 2012 , as rome finished the 2011 season with a 60–80 season and two different managers during the season with matt walbeck fired midseason by the organization after compiling a 25–45 bottom of the division record which was one of the worst in the minor leagues , and walbeck being replaced by rick albert who led the team to a 35–35 finish the 2nd half of the season faired much better for rome , going 44–24 and securing their first divisional crown in 6 seasons , even despite the overall season finish of 62–72 which would be worst in the southern division sporting one of the youngest clubs in full-season baseball , 2016 looked to be starting the same way under ingle , with a 27–42 having them at 6th in the division heading into the midseason break and austin riley , players that majorly make up most of the current major league roster for atlanta gave rome one of its biggest pushes and went on to finish the 2nd half with a 43–27 record , once again returning to the playoffs following their second championship season , ingle would serve one last year as manager for the rome braves in 2017 , end with his best overall record finish during his time in rome at 74–65 , but unfortunately coming up short of a return to postseason play 2018 saw rome return to their past by bringing back rocket wheeler , their manager from the 2003 championship season and the two seasons following wheeler had spent his time since leaving rome in the braves organization , taking over the pelicans for 5 seasons following his original departure , getting 1 season as the manager for the aa mississippi braves , and 4 seasons on the rookie level before managing the braves advanced a ball for the carolina mudcats in 2016 and florida fire frogs in 2017 for 2019 and into the modern day , matt tuiasosopo would be named the rome braves manager , and he would lead rome to a 65–74 overall record while missing the playoffs
