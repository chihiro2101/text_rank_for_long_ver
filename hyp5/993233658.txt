however , since osmium ( viii ) reagents like osmium tetroxide ( oso 4 ) are expensive and extremely toxic , it has become desirable to develop catalytic variants of this reaction the reaction mechanism of the sharpless dihydroxylation begins with the formation of the osmium tetroxide – ligand complex ( 2 ) methanesulfonamide ( ch 3 so 2 nh 2 ) has been identified as a catalyst to accelerate this step of the catalytic cycle and if frequently used as an additive to allow non-terminal alkene substrates to react efficiently at 0 °c 600px the mechanism of the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation has been extensively studied and a potential secondary catalytic cycle has been identified ( see below ) if the osmylate ester intermediate is oxidized before it dissociates , then an osmium ( viii ) -diol complex is formed which may then dihydroxylate another alkene this secondary pathway may be suppressed by using a higher molar concentration of ligand this intermediate would then undergo a migratory insertion to form an osmylate ester which after hydrolysis would give the corresponding diol given below is a brief overview of the various components of the catalytic system : catalytic oxidant : this is always oso 4 , however certain additives can coordinate to the osmium ( viii ) and modify its electronic properties stoichiometric oxidant : peroxides were among the first stoichiometric oxidants to be used in this catalytic cycle ; see the milas hydroxylation potassium ferricyanide ( k 3 fe ( cn ) 6 ) is the most commonly used stoichiometric oxidant for the reaction , and is the oxidant that comes in the commercially available ad-mix preparations
