according to damasio , sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness , which otherwise commonly and collectively describes sentience plus further features of the mind and consciousness , such as creativity , intelligence , sapience , self-awareness , and intentionality ( the ability to have thoughts about something ) one such criticism is about recognition paradoxes , one example of which is that an entity that can not distinguish a spider from a non-spider can not be arachnophobia more generally , it is argued that since it is not possible to attach an emotional response to stimuli that can not be recognized , emotions can not exist independently of cognition that can recognize the claim that precise recognition exists as specific attention to some details in a modular mind is criticized both with regard to data loss as a small system of disambiguating synapses in a module physically can not make as precise distinctions as a interferometry encompassing the whole brain , and for energy loss as having one system for motivation that needs some built-in cognition to recognize anything anyway and another cognitive system for making strategies would cost more energy than integrating it all in one system that use the same synapses the original studies by ivan pavlov that showed that conditioned reflexes in human children are more discriminating than those in dogs , human children salivating only at ticking frequencies very close to those at which food was served while dogs drool at a wider range of frequencies , have been followed up in recent years with comparative studies on more species it is shown that both brain size and brain-wide connectivity contribute to make perception more discriminating , as predicted by the theory of a brain-wide perception system but not by the theory of separate systems for emotion and cognition according to thomas nagel in his paper what is it like to be a bat ? , consciousness can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective perceptual experiences , or as some philosophers refer to them , '' qualia '' â€”in other words , the ability to have states that it feels like something to be in some philosophers , notably colin mcginn , believe that the physical process causing consciousness to happen will never be understood , a position known as '' new mysterianism regarding animal consciousness , according to the animal consciousness , which was publicly proclaimed on 7 july 2012 at the cambridge university , consciousness is that which requires specialized nervous system , chiefly neuroanatomical , neurochemical , and neurophysiological substrates , which manifests in more complex organisms as the central nervous system , to exhibit consciousness sponges , placozoans , and mesozoans , with simple body plans and no nervous system , are the only members of the animal kingdom that possess no consciousness water , for example , is a sentient being of the first order , as it is considered to possess only one sense , that of touch according to buddhism , sentient beings made of pure consciousness are possible some in the animal rights movement contend that the ability to experience pleasure and pain implies sentience sentiocentrism describes the theory that sentient individuals are the center of moral concern he asserts that , '' all sentient beings , humans or nonhuman , have one right : the basic right not to be treated as the property of others
