unusually , he spent his entire academic life in the faculty of arts , rather than obtaining the doctorate in law , medicine or theology that typically prepared the way for a career in philosophy also unusual for a philosopher of his time , buridan further maintained his intellectual independence by remaining a secular clergy , rather than joining a religious order indeed , he is listed in a document from 1350 as being among the teachers capable of supporting themselves without the need for financial assistance from the university zupko has speculated that buridan '' deliberately chose to remain among the 'artists artistae ' , '' possibly envisioning philosophy as a secular enterprise based on what is evident to both the senses and the intellect , rather than the non-evident truths of theology revealed through scripture and doctrine 16 none of the stories can be confirmed , and most contradict known historical information others suggest that he was expelled from paris due to his nominalist teachings and moved to vienna to found the university of vienna aristotle , and his peripatetic followers held that a body was maintained in motion only by the action of a continuous external force the theory of impetus proposed that motion was maintained by some property of the body , imparted when it was set in motion buridan was the first to name this motion-maintaining property impetus but the theory itself probably did not originate with him this is closely related to the modern concept of momentum after leaving the arm of the thrower , the projectile would be moved by an impetus given to it by the thrower and would continue to be moved as long as the impetus remained stronger than the resistance , and would be of infinite duration were it not diminished and corrupted by a contrary force resisting it or by something inclining it to a contrary motion ( questions on aristotle 's metaphysics xii.9 : 73ra ) buridan also contended that impetus is a variable quality whose force is determined by the speed and quantity of the matter in the subject duhem 1906â€“13 zupko has disagreed , pointing out that buridan did not use his theory to transform the science of mechanics , but instead remained a committed aristotelian in thinking that motion and rest are contrary states and that the universe is finite in extent
