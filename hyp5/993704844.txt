resource depletion accounting uses data provided from countries to estimate the adjustments needed due to their use and depletion of the natural capital available to them depletion accounting factors in several different influences such as the number of years until resource exhaustion , the cost of resource extraction and the demand of the resource resource extraction industries make up a large part of the economic activity in developing countries this , in turn , leads to higher levels of resource depletion and environmental degradation in developing countries depletion accounting also seeks to measure the social value of natural resources and ecosystems environmentalists are interested in depletion accounting as a way to track the use of natural resources over time , hold governments accountable or to compare their environmental conditions to those of another country for depletion accounting to work , appropriate units of natural resources must be established so that natural resources can be viable in the market economy a united states geological survey ( usgs ) study found a significant long-term trend over the 20th century for non-renewable resources such as minerals to supply a greater proportion of the raw material inputs to the non-fuel , non-food sector of the economy ; an example is the greater consumption of crushed stone , sand , and gravel used in construction ) , as well as rare earth minerals , face production output limitations from time to time , because supply involves large up-front investments and is therefore slow to respond to rapid increases in demand minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the present century : aluminium ( 2057 ) coal ( 2060 ) iron ( 2068 ) such projections may change , as new discoveries are made and typically misinterpret available data on mineral resources and mineral reserves one of the main causes of deforestation is clearing forests for agricultural reasons as the population of developing areas , especially near rainforests , increases , the need for land for farming becomes more and more important for most people , a forest has no value when its resources are not being used , so the incentives to deforest these areas outweigh the incentives to preserve the forests for this reason , the economic value of the forests is very important for the developing countries because deforestation is so extensive , it has made several significant impacts on the environment , including : carbon dioxide in the atmosphere changing the water cycle an increase in soil erosion a decrease in biodiversity deforestation and global warming 737â€“738 one of the most pressing issues that deforestation creates is soil erosion the united nations and the world bank created programs such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( redd ) , which works especially with developing countries to use subsidies or other incentives to encourage citizens to use the forest in a more sustainable way groundwater supplies wells and aquifers for private , agricultural , and public use and is used by more than a third of the world 's population every day for their drinking water groundwater is considered to be a non-renewable resource because less than six percent of the water around the world is replenished and renewed on a human timescale of 50 years due to this increase in depletion , in some of the most depleted areas use of groundwater for irrigation has become impossible or cost prohibitive there are two different perspectives to groundwater depletion , the first is that depletion is considered literally and simply as a reduction in the volume of water in the saturated zone , regardless of water quality considerations
