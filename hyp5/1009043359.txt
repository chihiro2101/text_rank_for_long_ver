in the roman britain period , the area of modern kent that lay east of the river medway was a civitas known as cantiaca its name had been taken from an older common brittonic place-name , cantium ( '' corner of land '' or '' land on the edge '' ) used in the preceding pre-roman iron age , although the extent of this tribal area is unknown as the closest part of britain to mainland europe , it is likely that kent would have experienced many attacks from seafaring raiders , resulting in the construction of four saxon shore along the kentish coast : regulbium , rutupiae , dubris , and portus lemanis it is also likely that germanic-speaking mercenaries from northern gaul , known as foederati , would have been hired to supplement official roman troops during this period , with land in kent as payment however , urban centres also witnessed decline ; canterbury evidenced a declining population and reduced activity from the late third century onward , while dover was abandoned by the end of the fourth century according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , produced in late anglo-saxon england and not considered an accurate record of events in the fifth century , in 418 many romans left britain via kent , taking much of their wealth with them there has been much debate as to the scale of this migration ; some see it as a mass migration in which large numbers of germanic peoples left northern europe to settle in britain , pushing the native british population to western britain or brittany ; others have argued that only a small warrior elite came over , dominating ( or even enslaving ) the romano-british population , who then began using the old english language and material culture of the newcomers currently , many scholars accept that there was significant regional variation , with the former view being more applicable in the south and east and the latter in the north and west 24 however , some of the romano-british population likely remained , as the roman name for the area , cantiaca , influenced the name of the new anglo-saxon kingdom , the cantware ( '' dwellers of kent '' ) a similar account is provided in bede 's ecclesiastical history : that the people of kent and isle of wight were descended from jutish settlers , and that horsa was killed in battle against the britons , adding that his body was buried in east kent little archaeological evidence of these early settlements exists , but one prominent example is a grubenhaus at lower warbank , keston that was built atop the site of a former roman villa , adjacent to a romano-british trackway through the north downs in the sixth century the kingdom of kent had some relationship with the merovingian-governed kingdom of francia , which was then extending its influence in northwestern europe textual sources suggest that kent may have been under merovingian control for part of this century archaeological evidence suggests that at some point in the sixth century , east kent annexed west kent firmly in the control of an elite class , kent is the first anglo-saxon kingdom to appear in the historical record in 597 the anglo-saxon chronicle refers to wars in sixth-century britain , but most were in the west and did not affect kent ; the one exception was a battle between the kentish and west saxons in 568 , during which æthelberht 's forces were pushed back into kent various seventh and eighth century documents attest to the fact that kent was governed by two kings , a dominant one in the east and a subordinate in the west , likely reflecting the earlier divide in the seventh century , kent 's power waned as that of mercia and northumbria grew , but it remained the fourth wealthiest kingdom in england , according to the tribal hidage with 15,000 hides of land recorded in the seventh or eighth century mercia 's control of kent increased in the following decades ; by 689–690 east saxon kings under mercian overlordship were active in west kent , and there are records attesting that æthelred arbitrated on the income of the christian communities at minster-in-thanet and reculver , indicating strong mercian control over the east of the kingdom too this division may have made kent the first target of the rising power of offa of mercia : in 764 , he gained supremacy over kent and ruled it through client kings by the early 770s , it appears that offa was attempting to rule kent directly , and a rebellion followed a battle was fought at otford in 776 , and although the outcome is unknown , records of following years suggest that the rebels prevailed ; egbert ii and later ealhmund seem to have ruled independently of offa for nearly a decade thereafter this suggests that from the seventh century onward , kings in kent were establishing control over the kingdom 's economic structure during the eighth and ninth centuries , a number of fortified earthworks , most notably wansdyke and offa 's dyke , were constructed as barriers between the warring kingdoms ; the faestendic passing through the river cray and the routeway that has since become the a25 were likely kentish earthworks of this period designed to protect the kingdom they moved further inland and engaged in numerous battles with the english , but after four years they gave up
