in most places , the pedestrian does not need specific facilities , as in low car flow streets , the pedestrians can cross ( without priority ) at any location a continuous ( usually raised ) central reservation promotes safe pedestrian crossing in all the area , and reduce vehicle speed and head-on crash provides a crossing in a low pedestrians flow area , if the pedestrian flow is high ( as outside a school , train or bus terminal ) the vehicle traffic will be severally affected by a significant number of pedestrians using the crossing , making necessary to provide traffic signals in this way , the vehicle signal turns red only if a pedestrian is trying to cross if the road is wide , ( two or more traffic lines per traffic direction ) and a central reservation exists or can be provided , traffic signals can be installed in a not aligned pair this design permits to provide staggered green time for pedestrians ( one side can be green while the other is red ) , the pedestrian needs to wait in the central reservation for the second crossing , improving the possibility to coordinate vehicle traffic between intersection , with a reduction of stops , fuel consumption , and reduced car emissions this facility is added in an intersection with a traffic signal , giving a clear orientation to a pedestrian when it is possible to cross '' special markings are often made on the road surface , both to direct pedestrians and to prevent motorists from stopping vehicles in the way of foot traffic in places where there is very high pedestrian traffic , embedded pavement flashing-light systems are used to signal traffic of pedestrian presence , or pedestrian scramble ( also known as barnes dances ) may be used , which stop vehicular traffic in all directions at the same time known as a pedestrian scramble , this type of vehicle all-way stop allows pedestrians to cross safely in any direction , including diagonally pedestrian refuges or small islands in the middle of a street may be added when a street is very wide , as these crossings can be too long for some individuals to cross in one cycle because of the characteristics of zebra crossings , parallel stripes that are wide but not long , the striping machine is often a small hand-guided road marking machine , which can easily be made to change direction to gain the right-of-way in some parts of canada , however , the pedestrian holds out his hand in a position much like that used to handshake , and steps off the curb at crossings controlled by signals , the most common variety is arranged like this : at each end of a crosswalk , the poles which hold the traffic lights also have white '' walk '' and portland orange '' do n't walk '' signs regardless of whether pictograms or words are used , the mutcd defines a steady '' upraised hand '' or '' do n't walk '' signal as an indication that a pedestrian can not enter the street in that signal 's direction , while a steady '' walking man '' or '' walk signal '' indicates that pedestrians can start crossing the street toward that signal the '' flashing walk '' indication was formerly used to delineate '' watch out for turning vehicles '' and is still in use in washington , d.c however , in some states ( such as utah ) , if the driver is in a school zone with the lights flashing , the driver must wait until the entire crosswalk is clear before he may proceed at signalized intersections without separate pedestrian signal heads , the traffic signals may be programmed to turn red in all directions , followed by a steady display of yellow lights simultaneously with the red indications zebra crossings are the only specific pedestrian crossing point that does not use light signals to control traffic movement such convention also consider that '' pedestrians wishing to cross a carriageway shall not step on to it without exercising care ; they shall use a pedestrian crossing whenever there is one nearby ; '' ( ยง6.a ) '' at other pedestrian crossings , pedestrians shall not step on to the carriageway without taking the distance and speed of approaching vehicles into account in europe , the pedestrian crossing is also dealt with european agreement supplementing the 1968 vienna convention on 1 may 1971 ( consolidated version including 1993 , 2001 , and 2006 amendments ) : '' in order to cross the carriageway elsewhere than at a pedestrian crossing signposted as such or indicated by markings on the carriageway , pedestrians shall not step on the carriageway without first making sure that they can do so without impeding vehicular traffic like some other countries , a flashing red sequence is used prior to steady red to clear pedestrians moments after , in some instances , a flashing yellow sequence ( for motorists ) can begin indicating that the vehicles may proceed through the crossing if safe to do so ; this is fairly uncommon however in districts with heavier traffic warranting the use of a traffic light such as inner city areas , the equivalent of the us 'standard ' configuration is used reflector signposting is used at crossings in school zones ; however , given that most school crossings in the country are manned , these signs only serve as a warning to motorists call buttons are installed at traffic lights with a dedicated pedestrian signal , and are used to bring up the pedestrian '' walk '' indication in locations where they function correctly in the majority of locations where call buttons are installed , pushing the button does not light up the pedestrian walk sign immediately reports suggest that many walk buttons in some areas , such as new york city and the united kingdom , may actually be either placebo buttons or nonworking call buttons that used to function correctly in the former case , these buttons are designed to give pedestrians an illusion of control while the crossing signal continues its operation as programmed however , in instances of the latter case , such as new york city 's , the buttons were simply deactivated when traffic signals were updated to automatically include pedestrian phases as part of every signal cycle in the united kingdom , pressing a button at a standalone pedestrian crossing that is unconnected to a junction will turn a traffic light red immediately , but this is not necessarily the case at a junction in boston , some busy intersections are programmed to give a pedestrian cycle during certain times of day ( so pushing the button is not necessary ) but at off-peak times a button push is required to get a pedestrian cycle in neighboring cambridge , a button press is always required if a button is available , though the city prefers to build signals where no button is present and the pedestrian cycle always happens between short car cycles the countdown is not supposed to be displayed during the pedestrian '' walk '' interval ( '' steady walking person '' phase ) , some municipalities have found that there are instances where pedestrian countdown signals may be less effective than standard hand/man or '' '' / '' '' signals additionally , a 2000 study of pedestrian countdown timers in lake buena vista , florida , at several intersections near walt disney world , found that pedestrians were more likely to cross the street during the pedestrian clearance interval ( flashing upraised hand ) if there is a timer present , compared to at intersections where there was no timer present however , other cities such as london found that countdown timers were effective , and new york city found that countdown signals worked mainly at longer crosswalks in taiwan , all the crossings feature animated men called xiaoluren ( '' little green man '' ) , who will walk faster immediately before the traffic signal will change other countries also use unusual '' walk '' and '' do n't walk '' pedestrian indicators the department felt that extending the walk phase permanently on cross streets would cause too much disruption to traffic flow on the highway and so the keywalk system was developed to allow for those who needed an extended green light phase to cross the road safely a small electronic key adjusted the green/walk and flashing red/complete crossing phases to allow more time for the key holder to complete the crossing of the highway safely these systems illuminate the crosswalk as well as surrounding areas , and do not always provide enough contrast between the pedestrian and his or her background pedestrian warning signs enhanced with led lights either within the sign face embedded leds in signs , federal highway administration , may 2009 or underneath it pedestrian crossings across railways may be arranged differently elsewhere , such as in new south wales , where they consist of : a barrier which closes when a train approaches ; a '' red man '' light ; no light when no train approaching an alarm in france , when a train is approaching , a red man is shown with the word stop flashing in red ( r25 signal ) in situations where there is little visibility along the railway , or the footpath is especially busy , there will also be a small set of lights with an explanatory sign when a train approaches , the signal light will change to red and an alarm will sound until the train has cleared the crossing research undertaken in new zealand showed that a zebra crossing without other safety features on average increases pedestrian crashes by 28 % compared to a location without crossings however , if combined with ( placed on top of ) a speed table , zebra crossings were found to reduce pedestrian crashes by 80 % study of 1,000 marked crosswalks and 1,000 unmarked comparison sites found that on most roads , the difference in safety performance of marked and unmarked crossings is not statistically significant , unless additional safety features are used on multilane roads carrying over 12,000 vehicles per day , a marked crosswalk is likely to have worse safety performance than an otherwise similar unmarked location , unless safety features such as raised median refuges or pedestrian beacons are also installed this study only included locations where vehicle traffic was not controlled by a signal or stop sign
