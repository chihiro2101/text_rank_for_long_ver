when you attain the way of strategy there will not be one thing you can not see upon their mastery of the strategy and timing listed in the five books , musashi states that you will be able to defeat ten men as easily as you could defeat one , and asks : '' when you have reached this point , will it not mean that you are invincible ? '' the strategies listed in this discipline or book relate to situations requiring different weapons and tactics , such as indoor weapons musashi indicates that during battle you should not overuse one weapon—this is as bad as using the weapon poorly since it becomes easy for an enemy to find a weakness in your style after countless uses of the same weapon the idea of timing as explained within the earth book is that you must be able to adapt your strategy to timing with your skill , in that you must know when to attack and when not to attack from the outset you must know the applicable timing and the inapplicable timing , and from among the large and small things and the fast and slow timings find the relevant timing , first seeing the distance timing and the background timing it is especially important to know the background timing , otherwise your strategy will become uncertain '' the book of earth ends with nine basic principles -- the '' ground '' upon which the samurai must rely so also should one possess the ability to change in accordance with one ’ s own situation to easily shift between disciplines , methods , and options when presented with new information a person should master many aspects of life allowing them to possess both balance and flexibility during battle , the spirituality and balance is something of which musashi notes that you should take advantage since small people know the spirituality of big people , they can thus note differences and weaknesses between each other this is something which seems easy , but it is said to change when you are on the battlefield , as then you must know to both adjust your spiritual balance according to what is around you , and to perceive the balance of those around you to take advantage accordingly in terms of stance , much like balance within the trooper , musashi notes that stance is an important part of strategy , or battle : adopt a stance with the head erect , neither hanging down , nor looking up , nor twisted in regards to the gaze of someone , he notes that a person must be able to perceive that which is all around him without moving their eyeballs noticeably , which is said to be a skill which takes an enormous amount of practice to perfect he notes that this is again one of the most important parts of strategy , as well as being able to see things which are close to you , such as the technique of an enemy as each is thought of as an attitude , it could be thought of that musashi means to practice with each '' attitude '' so that you do not become over-reliant upon one , something which musashi repeatedly notes as being worse than bad technique '' no attitude '' refers to those strategists who do not go with the use of the '' five attitudes '' and prefer to simply go without the attitudes of the long sword to focus entirely on technique , as opposed to focusing on both technique and the five attitudes '' in-one timing '' refers to the technique of biding your time until you can find a suitable gap in the enemies ' defense , to which you will deliver one fatal blow to the enemy although the technique seems relatively simple , musashi lists this as one of the hardest techniques to time correctly aside from this philosophical approach to the meaning , the technique is relatively simple to explain : if you are in a deadlock with the enemy , using the force from the cut , you push with your body and use the disciplines outlined in the void book to knock the enemy over '' flowing water cut '' technique refers to if you come into a fight with an enemy of a similar level to you in swordsmanship when attacking fast , musashi notes that you will always be at stalemate , so like stagnant water , you must cut as slowly as possible with your long sword by moving your body first and then that of your sword , you will be able to strike powerfully and broadly with a movement that seems to reflect the natural flow of water the fire book refers to fighting methods unlike the specific fighting techniques listed in the water book however , you can become a master of strategy by training alone with a sword , so that you can understand the enemy 's stratagems , his strength and resources , and come to appreciate how to apply strategy to beat ten thousand enemies musashi also seems to note the age old strategy of the high ground : you must look down on the enemy , and take up your attitude on slightly higher places although it is not mentioned , musashi must have been well aware that this method would also be the most likely to have a higher death count than the others due to the sheer mass of enemies because more than one enemy could then attack a single soldier or trooper a method particularly useful for musashi or others , if attacking a general directly would signal the end of the battle upon his defeat the idea of timing , as with singular battles , is known as the most important part of attacking next to the skill of participants however , the type of timing in this instance is somewhat different from the timing noted in the ground book since this variety of timing requires looking at the various physical factors which affect an enemy during battle , such as determining if strength is waning or rising within a group of troopers as there is collapse within an enemy , such as waning in his numbers , musashi notes that one must observe such events and use them to advantage whereas most of the information given in the previous books is useful in such a way that it could still be applicable today , this book is primarily concerned with the specific details about other strategies that existed at the time the broader lesson from this book is that an important part of understanding your own way is to understand the way of your opponent as precisely as possible he indicates that his appraisal may be one sided because the only school he had interest for was his own , and , in a way , he does not see parallels to his own creation and work at the same time , in the void , things we do not do or see ( which he calls spirit ) are part of the information which we perceive on a conscious level , but with which we have no physical relationship if this method is followed , your hand will attain movement through emptiness , with speed and power , without taking note of any point in which movement had begun if you are currently within a situation in which you and your opponent 's swords are to clash , you must strike extremely hard without raising your sword to any extent at this point in time , you need to completely equip yourself into the action of striking with your sword , and strike whenever you may see an opening , whether it may be the legs , arms , or head this is why you must always think of quickly getting your body close to the enemy with this technique , one 's objective is to get close to the opponent and stick to him
