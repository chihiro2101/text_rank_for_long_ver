a distinction is made between texts that recur for every mass celebration , ordinary ) , and texts that are sung depending on the occasion , proper ) it is usually ( but not always ) part of any musical setting of the mass as the kyrie is the first item in settings of the mass ordinary and the second in the requiem mass ( the only mass proper set regularly over the centuries ) , nearly all of the thousands of composers over the centuries who have set the ordinaries of the mass to music have included a kyrie movement in mass settings ( normally in english ) composed for the church of england 's book of common prayer liturgy , the gloria is commonly the last movement , because it occurs in this position in the text of the service in order one of the newer common worship liturgy , however , it is restored to its earlier place in the service the missa brevis et solemnis ( short and solemn ) is an exceptional format , for its best known instances tied to the salzburg of archbishop hieronymus colloredo , although earlier examples are extant the '' brevis et solemnis '' description applies to several of the masses mozart composed in salzburg between 1775 and 1780 , the sparrow mass being considered as its first instance for this composer thus , '' mass for the period of ( advent and ) lent '' indicates a mass composition without music for the gloria the sixth and last part of the ordinarium ( either ite , missa est , or , in masses without gloria , benedicamus domino ) is usually not set as part of a mass composition in a tridentine mass that part of the ordinarium is usually spoken , or sung to the gregorian melody provided in the roman missal , although early polyphonic settings for the '' deo gratias '' response ( e.g the proper of the mass is usually not set to music in a mass itself , except in the case of a requiem mass , but may be the subject of motets or other musical compositions also purely instrumental compositions can be part of a mass celebration , e.g in a liturgical mass , there are other sections that may be sung , often in gregorian chant ordinarium and proprium sections of a specific liturgical mass are not typically set to music together in the same composition the different portions of the ordinary came into the liturgy at different times , with the kyrie probably being first ( perhaps as early as the 7th century ) and the credo being last ( it did not become part of the roman mass until 1014 ) in the early 14th century , composers began writing polyphonic versions of the sections of the ordinary stylistically these settings are similar to both motets and secular music of the time , with a three-voice texture dominated by the highest part several anonymous complete masses from the 14th century survive , including the tournai mass ; however , discrepancies in style indicate that the movements of these masses were written by several composers and later compiled by scribes into a single set complete masses by a single composer were the norm by the middle of the 15th century , and the form of the mass , with the possibilities for large-scale structure inherent in its multiple movement format , was the main focus of composers within the area of sacred music ; it was not to be eclipsed until the motet and related forms became more popular in the first decades of the 16th century in particular , the song l'homme arm√© has a long history with composers ; more than 40 separate mass settings exist by the time of palestrina , however , most composers outside of rome were using other forms for their primary creative outlet for expression in the realm of sacred music , principally the motet and the madrigale spirituale ; composers such as the members of the venetian school preferred the possibilities inherent in the new forms the lutheran michael praetorius composed a mass for double choir in the old style , which he published in 1611 in the collection of church music for the mass in latin , missodia sionia composers like johann joseph fux in the 18th century continued to cultivate the stile antico mass , which was suitable for use on weekdays and at times when orchestral masses were not practical or appropriate , and in 19th-century germany the cecilian movement kept the tradition alive it spread to the german-speaking catholic countries north of the alps , using instruments for color and creating dialogues between solo voices and chorus that was to become characteristic of the 18th-century viennese style the so-called '' neapolitan '' or '' cantata '' mass style also had much influence on 18th-century mass composition with its short sections set as self-contained solo arias and choruses in a variety of styles later masses , especially of haydn , are of symphonic structure , with long sections divided into fewer movements , organized like a symphony , with soloists used as an ensemble rather than as individuals the distinction between concert masses and those intended for liturgical use also came into play as the 19th century progressed after the renaissance , the mass tended not to be the central genre for any one composer , yet among the most famous works of the baroque , classical , and romantic periods are settings of the ordinary of the mass many of the famous masses of the romantic era were requiems , one of the most famous , a german requiem by brahms , being the composer 's own selection of biblical texts rather than a setting of a standard liturgy the revival of choral celebration of holy communion in the anglican church in the late 19th century marked the beginning several liturgical settings of mass texts in english , particularly for choir and organ nevertheless , the mass in its musical incarnation continues to thrive beyond the walls of the church , as is evident in many of the 21st-century masses listed here which were composed for concert performance rather than in service of the roman rite pope pius x initiated many regulations reforming the liturgical music of the mass in the early 20th century he felt that some of the masses composed by the famous post-renaissance composers were too long and often more appropriate for a theatrical rather than a church setting some of the rules he put forth include the following : tra le sollecitudini that any mass be composed in an integrated fashion , not by assembling different compositions for different parts in the 20th century , composers continued to write masses , in an even wider diversity of style , form and function than before these are more often known as 'communion services ' , and differ not only in that they are settings of english words , but also , as mentioned above , in that the gloria usually forms the last movement since the texts of the 'benedictus qui venit ' and the 'agnus dei ' do not actually feature in the liturgy of the 1662 book of common prayer , these movements are often missing from some of the earlier anglican settings
