one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he.—plutarch , apothegms of the lacedamonians now the succession belonging to agis by law , agesilaus , who in all probability was to be but a private man , was educated according to the usual discipline of the country , hard and severe , and meant to teach young men to obey their superiors in order to the good education of their youth ( which , as i said before , he thought the most important and noblest work of a lawgiver ) , he went so far back as to take into consideration their very conception and birth , by regulating their marriages he also describes how the spartans limited civic education so as to maintain social control over the young : reading and writing they gave them , just enough to serve their turn ; their chief care was to make them good subjects , and to teach them to endure pain and conquer in battle for lycurgus , who ordered , as we saw , that a great piece of money should be but of an inconsiderable value , on the contrary would allow no discourse to be current which did not contain in few words a great deal of useful and curious sense ; children in sparta , by a habit of long silence , came to give just and sententious answers ; for , indeed , as loose and incontinent livers are seldom fathers of many children , so loose and incontinent talkers seldom originate many sensible words '' as well to think and reflect on matters of civic virtue , including such questions as who is or is not a good citizen of sparta parallel lives , lycurgus.the iren , or under-master , used to stay a little with them after supper , and one of them he bade to sing a song , to another he put a question which required an advised and deliberate answer ; for example , who was the best man in the city ? what he thought of such an action of such a man ? they used them thus early to pass a right judgment upon persons and things , and to inform themselves of the abilities or defects of their countrymen montaigne would later praise this particular technique of education , admiring the way spartan citizens spent their time learning to acquire virtues such as courage and temperance , to the exclusion of studying any other subject it is a thing worthy of very great consideration , that in that excellent , and , in truth , for its perfection , prodigious form of civil regimen set down by lycurgus , though so solicitous of the education of children , as a thing of the greatest concern , and even in the very seat of the muses , he should make so little mention of learning ; as if that generous youth , disdaining all other subjection but that of virtue , ought to be supplied , instead of tutors to read to them arts and sciences , with such masters as should only instruct them in valour , prudence , and justice ; an example that plato has followed in his laws '' essentially , the spartan ideal of civic education was a process whereby the interest of the citizen becomes totally united with the interest of the polity , in a spirit of perfect patriotism : 'to conclude , lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves ; they were to make themselves one with the public good , and , clustering like bees around their commander , be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves , and devoted wholly to their country '' to conclude , lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves ; they were to make themselves one with the public good , and , clustering like bees around their commander , be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves , and devoted wholly to their country pericles ' funeral oration provides insight into athens ' sharply contrasting form of civic education from sparta , for personal freedom , rather than blind obedience , where he boasts that athens is 'the school of hellas ' , since : in education , where our rivals from their very cradles by a painful discipline seek after manliness , at athens we live exactly as we please , and yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger however , english philosopher thomas hobbes believed that the athenians were only taught to think they had personal freedom in order to discourage them from seeking reform during his diatribe , he emphasises the importance of poetry to civic education : small children have a teacher helping them , for young men there ’ s the poets—we ’ ve got a solemn duty to say useful things '' amongst the persons there the most renowned for their learning all their wisdom in state matters was one thales , whom lycurgus , by importunities and assurances of friendship , persuaded to go over to lacedaemon ; where , though by his outward appearance and his own profession he seemed to be no other than a lyric poet , in reality he performed the part of one of the ablest lawgivers in the world '' here he had the first sight of homer 's works , in the hands , we may suppose , of the posterity of creophylus ; and , having observed that the few loose expressions and actions of ill example which are to be found in his poems were much outweighed by serious lessons of state and rules of morality , he set himself eagerly to transcribe and digest them into order , as thinking they would be of good use in his own country in the euripides tragedy the suppliants , adrastus of argos describes how hippomedon received his civic education for endurance , martial skill , and service to the state : such another was hippomedon , third of all this band ; from his very boyhood he refrained from turning towards the allurements of the muses , to lead life of ease ; his home was in the fields , and gladly would he school his nature to hardships with a view to manliness , aye hasting to the chase , rejoicing in his steeds or straining of his bow , because he would make himself of use unto his state '' and then , that i did not fall into the ambition of ordinary sophists , either to write tracts concerning the common theorems , or to exhort men unto virtue and the study of philosophy by public orations ; as also that i never by way of ostentation did affect to show myself an active able man , for any kind of bodily exercises '' from his brother he imbibed a specific ideal for the roman state : he it was also that did put me in the first conceit and desire of an equal commonwealth , administered by justice and equality ; and of a kingdom wherein should be regarded nothing more than the good and welfare of the subjects he also followed the example of his adopted father antoninus pius , who he said kept careful watch of government administration and finances , was open to hearing ideas about how to serve the common good , and cared neither neither for ambition nor pandering to the popular will : again , that secrets he neither had many , nor often , and such only as concerned public matters : his discretion and moderation , in exhibiting of the public sights and shows for the pleasure and pastime of the people : in public buildings aurelius was also taught by his father how to live as a public figure restrained by modesty : that i lived under the government of my lord and father , who would take away from me all pride and vainglory , and reduce me to that conceit and opinion that it was not impossible for a prince to live in the court without a troop of guards and followers , extraordinary apparel , such and such torches and statues , and other like particulars of state and magnificence ; but that a man may reduce and contract himself almost to the state of a private man , and yet for all that not to become the more base and remiss in those public matters and affairs , wherein power and authority is requisite from aristotles civill philosophy , they have learned , to call all manner of common-wealths but the popular , ( such as was at that time the state of athens , ) tyranny neither hath learning an influence and operation only upon civil merit and moral virtue , and the arts or temperature of peace and peaceable government ; but likewise it hath no less power and efficacy in enablement towards martial and military virtue and prowess , as may be notably represented in the examples of alexander the great and cæsar the dictator ( mentioned before , but now in fit place to be resumed ) , of whose virtues and acts in war there needs no note or recital , having been the wonders of time in that kind ; but of their affections towards learning and perfections in learning it is pertinent to say somewhat but is it not true also , that much less young men are fit auditors of matters of policy , till they have been thoroughly seasoned in religion and morality ; lest their judgments be corrupted , and made apt to think that there are no true differences of things ? project gutenberg
