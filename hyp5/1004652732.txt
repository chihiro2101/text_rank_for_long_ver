in particularly dangerous times , such as when the home countries were at war , a convoy system would be used whereby the ships were escorted by a warship while the british used armed passenger liners defensively for protecting their shipping , the german approach was to use them offensively to attack enemy shipping a famous amc of world war i was the british which , after a battle that caused heavy damage on both sides , sank the german auxiliary cruiser near the brazilian island of trinidade in 1914 . both the spanish and united states navy used auxiliary cruisers during the spanish–american war of 1898 in world war i , the imperial german navy initially used fast passenger ships , such as past holders of the blue riband for fastest north atlantic crossings , but they made obvious and easy targets because of their very familiar silhouettes the germans , therefore , soon moved on to using captured and refitted allied vessels , but principally modified transport ships many were sunk after being caught by regular warships & nbsp ; – an unequal battle , since auxiliary cruisers had poor fire control and no armor her sister ship , , had a legendary journey , sinking or capturing a total of 15 ships in 1914 and 1915 , before finally running out of supplies and having to put into port in virginia , where the americans interned her and eventually converted her into the united states navy troop transport uss von steuben this was the only occasion in history when an armed merchantman managed to sink a modern warship ; in most cases , auxiliary cruiser raiders tried to avoid confrontation with warships during world war ii , german auxiliary cruisers are believed to have either sunk or captured some of allied shipping cam and mac ships remained as civilian ships operated by civilian crews , with fleet air arm or royal netherlands navy '' air parties '' despite a rise in modern piracy , it was up until the early 2010s very unusual for modern merchant ships to be armed , save for maybe a number of small arms and the use of the ship 's fire hoses to repel boarders transporting enough fissile material between them to produce 50–60 nuclear weapons , these ships , beginning with the pacific pintail and pacific teal , became armed in 1999 to avoid the cost of a royal navy escort since the late 19th century various navies have used armed merchant ships in the role of auxiliary cruisers , also called armed merchant cruisers
