after world war ii , anti-communist sentiments quickly became associated with the personal secrets of people who worked for the us government the gay couple introduced martin and lyon to another lesbian couple , one of whom suggested they create a social club one of their priorities was to have a place to dance , as dancing with the same sex in a public place was illegal 77 although unsure of how exactly to proceed with the group , they began to meet regularly , realized they should be organized , and quickly elected martin as president martin and lyon justified the name , writing later , '' if anyone asked us , we could always say we belong to a poetry club the organization filed a charter for non-profit corporation status in 1957 , writing a description so vague , phyllis lyon remembered , '' it could have been a charter for a cat-raising club within a year of its creation , most of the original eight participants were no longer part of the group , but their numbers had grown to 16 , and they decided they wanted to be more than only a social alternative to bars they knew that.without support to develop the self-confidence necessary to advocate for one 's rights , no social change would be possible for lesbians 149 soon after forming , the dob wrote a mission statement that addressed the most significant problem martin and lyon had faced as a couple : the complete lack of information about female homosexuality in what historian martin meeker termed '' the most fundamental journey a lesbian has to make 79 when the club realized they were not allowed to advertise their meetings in the local newspaper , lyon and martin , who both had backgrounds in journalism , began to print a newsletter to distribute to as many women as the group knew in october 1956 it became the ladder , the first nationally distributed lesbian publication in the u.s 426 the statement was composed of four parts that prioritized the purpose of the organization , and it was printed on the inside of the cover of every issue of the ladder until 1970 : education of the variant.to enable her to understand herself and make her adjustment to society.this to be accomplished by establishing.a library.on the sex deviant theme ; by sponsoring public discussions.to be conducted by leading members of the legal psychiatric , religious and other professions ; by advocating a mode of behavior and dress acceptable to society new york chapter president barbara gittings noted that the word '' variant '' was used instead of '' lesbian '' in the mission statement because '' lesbian '' was a word that had a very negative connotation in 1956 retrieved november 11 , 2007 this was reflected in ongoing debate over the propriety of butch and femme dress and role play among its members 24 barbara gittings recalled years later an instance when , in preparation for a national convention , members of the dob persuaded a woman who had worn men 's clothing all her life '' to deck herself out in as 'feminine ' a manner as she could 4 issue 3 : p.23 wolden was responsible for materials that stated , '' you parents of daughters — do not sit back complacently feeling that because you have no boys in your family everything is all right 150 even the fbi was curious enough to attend meetings to report in 1959 , '' the purpose of the dob is to educate the public to accept the lesbian homosexual into society press releases announcing the convention were sent to local radio and newspapers , prompting san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen to direct a jab at russell wolden and publicize the convention , writing : '' russ wolden , if no one else , will be interested to learn that the daughters of bilitis will hold their nat ' l convention here may 27–30 the second national convention , held in 1962 , was also notable for its being covered on television on the kttv 's confidential file , a nationally syndicated show ; this was probably the first american national broadcast that specifically covered lesbianism however , in 1962 at the daughters ' second convention , national president jaye bell again argued for the pragmatic approach of integration and patience with a slow criminal justice system two things happened in 1963 that changed the course of the organization '' pennsylvania '' wrote 3,000 checks to different dob members , who in turn signed them over to the organization in 1964 , martin and lyon began to control less of the organization , saying , '' we felt that if the organization had any validity at all it could n't be based on two people , it had to be able to stand and grow on its own most notably , on the eve of january 1 , 1965 , several homophile organizations in san francisco , california , including the dob , the crh , the society for individual rights , and the mattachine society , held a fund-raising ball for their mutual benefit at california hall on polk street this event has been called '' san francisco 's stonewall '' by some historians ; the participation of such prominent litigators in the defense of smith , donaldson and the other two lawyers marked a turning point in gay rights on the west coast of the united states gittings also ran a regular column in the ladder that she called '' living propaganda '' encouraging women to come out to their friends and family members del martin has written that the daughters of bilitis was a feminist organization from the beginning , focusing on the problems of women as well as problems of the female homosexual ; however , in the mid-1960s feminism became a much higher priority to many of the women in the organization in 1966 , del martin and phyllis lyon joined the national organization for women , and urged readers of the ladder to do the same , even reporting they got a family discount 59 the historian martin meeker points to the 1966 dob convention that was a 10-day affair joining the dob with the north american conference of homophile organizations ( nacho ) as the turning point where women 's issues in the dob began to have more importance to its members than gay issues the daughters were also affected by the changing times younger members did not share the concerns of older members ; they were more moved by revolutionary tactics ( though not all older members in the dob were anti-radical ; for example , as president of the new york chapter of the dob , ruth simpson organized gay rights demonstrations as well as educational programs for dob members during the period of 1969–71 ) problems in the organization of the national governing board were becoming increasingly worse when local chapters were unable to take action on issues important to them without the approval of the national board because laporte took the list over state lines , pursuing it would have been a federal matter , and the daughters did not have the resources to see it through 161 grier severed ties with dob leadership and in doing so took away the daughters ' primary method of communication from the national organization to its individual chapters as a national organization , the daughters of bilitis folded in 1970 , although some local chapters still continued until 1995 grier also effectively ended the ladder , despite her plans for the magazine to run on advertising ( something the ladder had not previously had ) and subscriptions , when the 3,000 checks from '' pennsylvania '' written to the dob stopped coming faderman , chapters 8-10 however , the impact of the 14-year run of the dob on the lives of women was described by historian martin meeker thusly : '' the dob succeeded in linking hundreds of lesbians across the country with one another and gathering them into a distinctly modern communication network that was mediated through print and , consequently , imagination , rather than sight , sound , smell , and touch daughters of bilitis ( australia ) history of lesbianism in the united states minorities research group ruth simpson the ladder ( magazine )
