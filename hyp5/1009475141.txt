in 1759 , charles iii of spain ascended to the throne of spain ; he soon sent out a visitor-general with the power to investigate and reform all parts of colonial government after receiving private instruction , likely from the priest of the neighboring parish , hidalgo was ready for further education hidalgo 's study of french allowed him to read and study works of the enlightenment current in europe but , at the same time , forbidden by the catholic church in mexico as rector , hidalgo continued studying the liberal ideas that were coming from france and other parts of europe in his personal life , he did not advocate or live the way expected of 18th-century mexican priests as a secular cleric , he was not bound by a vow of poverty , so he , like many other secular priests , pursued business activities , including owning three haciendas ; guedea , '' miguel hidalgo y costilla '' , p fearing his arrest , hidalgo commanded his brother mauricio , as well as ignacio allende and mariano abasolo , to go with a number of other armed men to make the sheriff release prison inmates in dolores on the night of 15 september 1810 on the morning of 16 september 1810 , hidalgo celebrated mass , which was attended by about 300 people , including hacienda owners , local politicians and spaniards there he gave what is now known as the grito de dolores ( cry of dolores ) , calling the people of his parish to leave their homes and join with him in a rebellion against the current government , in the name of their king intellectuals , liberal priests and many poor people followed hidalgo with a great deal of enthusiasm hidalgo permitted indians and mestizos to join his war in such numbers that the original motives of the querétaro group were obscured however , hidalgo 's actions and the people 's response , meant he would lead and not allende the people who followed hidalgo also had no military training , experience or equipment many villagers that joined the insurgent army came to believe that fernando vii himself commanded their loyalty to hidalgo and the monarch was in new spain personally directing the rebellion against his own government they remained here for a while and then decided to march towards mexico city hidalgo and his forces took valladolid with little opposition on 17 october 1810 the insurgents stayed in the city for some days preparing to march to the capital of new spain , mexico city the canon of the cathedral went unarmed to meet hidalgo and got him to promise that the atrocities of san miguel , celaya and guanajuato would not be repeated in valladolid so he jailed all the spaniards , replaced city officials with his own and looted the city treasury before marching off toward mexico city left after the battle of monte de las cruces on 30 october 1810 , hidalgo still had some 100,000 insurgents and was in a strategic position to attack mexico city the royalist government in mexico city , under the leadership of viceroy francisco venegas , prepared psychological and military defenses hidalgo 's forces came as close as what is now the cuajimalpa borough of mexico city allende wanted to press forward and attack the capital , but hidalgo disagreed as the capital was guarded by some of the best-trained soldiers in new spain , hidalgo might have feared a bloodbath hidalgo established an alternative government in guadalajara with himself at the head and then appointed two ministers he named pascacio ortiz de letona as representative of the insurgent government and sent him to the united states to seek support there , but ortiz de letona was apprehended by the spanish army en route to philadelphia and promptly executed after he arrived at the city , allende again objected to hidalgo concerning the insurgent violence however , hidalgo knew the royalist army was on its way to guadalajara and wanted to stay on good terms with his own army bishop abad y queipo had formerly been a friend of hidalgo and also worked for the welfare of the people , but the bishop was adamantly opposed to hidalgo 's tactics and the resultant disruptions , alleged '' sacrileges '' and purported ill-treatment of priests fearful of losing the support of his army , hidalgo responded that he had never departed from church doctrine in the slightest degree allende and abasolo wanted to concentrate their forces in the city and plan an escape route should they be defeated , but hidalgo rejected this their second choice then was to make a stand at the calderon bridge ( puente de calderón ) just outside the city at hacienda de pabellón , on 25 january 1811 , near aguascalientes , allende and other insurgent leaders took military command away from hidalgo , blaming him for their defeats hidalgo remained as head politically but with military command going to allende the heads remained there for ten years until the end of the mexican war of independence to serve as a warning to other insurgents he has been hailed as the father of the nation even though it was agustín de iturbide and not hidalgo who achieved mexican independence in 1821 shortly after gaining independence , the day to celebrate it varied between 16 september , the day of hidalgo 's grito , and 27 september , the day iturbide rode into mexico city to end the war later , political movements would favor the more liberal hidalgo over the conservative iturbide , and 16 september 1810 became the officially recognized day of mexican independence the reason for this is that hidalgo is considered to be '' precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the ( mexican war of ) independence next to it is a lamp lit to represent the sacrifice of those who gave their lives for mexican independence
