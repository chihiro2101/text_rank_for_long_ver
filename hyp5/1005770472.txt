most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen as started somewhere between the 1970s , the early 1990s transformations of the socialist east and the 2000s period that formed most of today 's net principles and currently as is changing the way societies work fundamentally information technology goes beyond the internet , as the principles of internet design and usage influence other areas , and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is frank webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society : technological , economic , occupational , spatial and cultural one problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship , we can describe some societies ( especially the japanese society ) as an information society because we think of it as such according to buckland in information and society , most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge : information as knowledge , information as a process , and information as a thing . the growth of computer information in society beniger describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way : “ the need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period ( 1740-1830 ) ” ( p development of the information society model one of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the economist fritz machlup this book was widely regarded susan crawford : '' the origin and development of a concept : the information society '' ideas of a knowledge or information economy , post-industrial society , postmodern society , network society , the information revolution , informational capitalism , network capitalism , and the like , have been debated over the last several decades fritz machlup ( 1962 ) introduced the concept of the knowledge economy peter drucker has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge based on such indicators , the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the gnp is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy 68-88 for daniel bell the number of employees producing services and information is an indicator for the informational character of a society that is why we can call it the programmed society , because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management , production , organization , distribution , and consumption , so that such a society appears , at all its functional levels , as the product of an action exercised by the society itself , and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities '' ( touraine 1988 : 104 ) in the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information , consumption , health , research , education would be industrialized this makes touraine 's concept substantially different from that of daniel bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning similarly to bell , peter otto and philipp sonntag ( 1985 ) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs , i.e nico stehr ( 1994 , 2002a , b ) says that in the knowledge society a majority of jobs involves working with knowledge '' contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge '' ( stehr 2002b : 18 ) also alvin toffler argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society : '' in a third wave economy , the central resource – a single word broadly encompassing data , information , images , symbols , culture , ideology , and values – is actionable knowledge '' ( dyson/gilder/keyworth/toffler 1994 ) at the end of the twentieth century , the concept of the network society gained importance in information society theory '' one of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure , which explains the use of the concept of 'network society ' '' ( castells 2000 : 21 ) '' as an historical trend , dominant functions and processes in the information age are increasingly organized around networks for castells the network society is the result of informationalism , a new technological paradigm jan van dijk ( 2006 ) defines the network society as a '' social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels ( individual , group/organizational and societal ) for van dijk networks have become the nervous system of society , whereas castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation , van dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society darin barney uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics : '' the first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution , technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social , political and economic practices that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society critics such as frank webster argue that these approaches stress discontinuity , as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago they acknowledge that information society theories stress some important new qualities of society ( notably globalization and informatization ) , but charge that they fail to show that these are attributes of overall capitalist structures for describing contemporary society based on a new dialectic of continuity and discontinuity , other critical scholars have suggested several terms like : transnational network capitalism , transnational informational capitalism ( christian fuchs 2008 , 2007 ) : '' computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism , that is , regimes of accumulation , regulation , and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic , political , and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication '' networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before '' ( schiller 2000 : xiv ) virtual capitalism : the '' combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares , and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital '' ( dawson/john bellamy foster 1998 : 63sq ) , high-tech capitalism wolfgang fritz haug ( 2003 ) high-tech-kapitalismus castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society ( castells 2000 : 500 ) overall , neo-marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge , information technologies , and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ( david harvey 1989 ) information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society , the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society , and how to define such concepts as technology has advanced so too has the way people have adapted in sharing information with each other '' second nature '' refers a group of experiences that get made over by culture so , by following a particular pattern created by culture we are able to recognise how we use and move information in different ways therefore , through the use of second nature and third nature society is able to use and explore new vectors of possibility where information can be moulded to create new forms of interaction theoreticians like ulrich beck , anthony giddens and manuel castells argue that since the 1970s a transformation from industrial society to informational society has happened on a global scale as steam power was the technology standing behind industrial society , so information technology is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation , societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century a number of terms in current use emphasize related but different aspects of the emerging global economic order the information age is somewhat limiting , in that it refers to a 30-year period between the widespread use of computers and the knowledge economy , rather than an emerging economic order the computer revolution , and knowledge revolution refer to specific revolutionary transitions , rather than the end state towards which we are evolving the information revolution relates with the well known terms agricultural revolution and industrial revolution in connection with the development of the information society , information pollution appeared , which in turn evolved information ecology – associated with information hygiene one of the central paradoxes of the information society is that it makes information easily reproducible , leading to a variety of freedom/control problems relating to intellectual property caveat : information society is often used by politicians meaning something like '' we all do internet now '' ; the sociological term information society ( or informational society ) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure the information age : economy , society and culture ( 2014 ) italian operaismo and the information machine , theory , culture & society , first
