he came to the kingdom of jerusalem before 1153 when he was mentioned as a mercenary fighting in the army of baldwin iii of jerusalem louisvii left the holy land for france in the summer of 1149 , but raynald stayed behind in palestine raymond , prince of antioch , and thousands of his soldiers fell in the battle of inab on 28june 1148 , leaving the principality almost undefended baldwiniii of jerusalem ( who was the cousin of raymond 's widow , constance , the ruling princess of antioch ) came to antioch at the head of his army at least three times during the following years it is certain that raynald fought in baldwin 's army during the siege of ascalon in early 1153 he may have already been engaged to constance of antioch ( as runciman suggests ) , or their betrothal took place during raynald 's visit to the principality before the end of the siege ( as malcolm barber proposes ) emperor manuel sent his envoys to antioch , proposing to recognize raynald as the new prince if he launched a campaign against the armenians of cilicia , who had risen up against byzantine rule they only left cyprus on the rumour of an imperial fleet approaching the island , but only after they had forced all cypriots to ransom themselves , with the exception of the wealthiest individuals ( including emperor manuel 's nephew , john doukas komnenos ) , whom they carried off to antioch before the capitulation of the garrison , baldwin decided to grant the fortress to thierry of flanders , but raynald demanded that the count should pay homage to him for the town william of tyre stated that '' the glory of the latin world was put to shame '' on this occasion , because envoys from the nearby muslim and christian rulers were also present at raynald 's humiliation raynald also had to promise that he would allow a byzantine garrison to stay in the citadel whenever it was required and would send a troop to fight in the byzantine army when gümüshtekin , governor of aleppo , one of the last independent muslim rulers in syria before saladin , had conquered almost all neighboring states , he released raynald , along with joscelin of courtenay and all other christians prisoners in 1176 hugo etherianis , who lived in constantinople after around 1165 , mentioned in the preface of his about the procession of the holy spirit that he had asked '' prince raynald '' to deliver a copy of the work to aimery of limoges according to historian bernard hamilton , these words suggest that raynald led the embassy that baldwiniv sent to constantinople to confirm an alliance between jerusalem and the byzantine empire against egypt baldwin iv 's cousin , philip i , count of flanders , came to the holy land at the head of a crusader army in early august 1177 the king offered him the regency , but philip refused the offer , saying that he did not want to stay in the kingdom philip declared that he was '' willing to take orders '' from anybody , but he protested when baldwin confirmed raynald 's position as '' regent of the kingdom and of the armies '' philip left the kingdom a month after his arrival saladin invaded the region of ascalon , but the royal army launched an attack on him in the battle of montgisard on 25november , leading to his defeat raynald was the first among the witnesses to sign most royal charters between 1177 and 1180 , showing that he was the king 's most influential official during this period raynald became one of the principal supporters of guy of lusignan , who married the king 's elder sister , sybilla , in early 1180 , although many barons of the realm had opposed the marriage raymond 's return to the royal court put an end to raynald 's paramount position he accepted the new situation and cooperated with the king and raymond during the fights against saladin in summer 1182 raynald 's soldiers were executed , and saladin took an oath that he would never forgive him though raynald 's naval expedition '' showed a remarkable degree of initiative '' , according to historian bernard hamilton , most modern historians agree that it contributed to the unification of syria and egypt under saladin 's rule according to ernoul , raynald 's wife sent dishes from the wedding to saladin , persuading him to stop bombarding the tower where her son and his wife stayed the high court of jerusalem had ruled that neither baldwinv 's mother , sybilla ( who was guy of lusignan 's wife ) , nor her sister , isabella ( who was the wife of raynald 's stepson ) , could be crowned without the decision of the pope , the holy roman emperor , and the kings of france and england about baldwinv 's lawful successor however , sybilla 's uncle , josceliniii of courtenay , took control of jerusalem with the support of raynald and other influential prelates and royal officials raynald headed the list of secular witnesses in four royal charters issued between 21october 1186 and 7march 1187 , showing that he had become a principal figure in the new king 's court this '' seems unlikely to be true '' , according to historian bernard hamilton , because the truce between the kingdom of jerusalem and saladin covered raynald 's domains raynald seized the caravan , possibly because he regarded the presence of soldiers as a breach of the truce , according to hamilton saladin sent his envoys to guy of lusignan , who accepted his demands saladin proclaimed a jihad ( or holy war ) against the kingdom , taking an oath that he would personally kill raynald for breaking the truce raynald and gerard of ridefort convinced guy of lusignan to take the initiative and attack saladin 's army , although raymondiii of tripoli had tried to persuade the king to avoid a direct fight with it according to ernoul , raynald 's head was struck off by saladin 's mamluks and it was brought to damascus to be '' dragged along the ground to show the saracens , whom the prince had wronged , that vengeance had been exacted '' baha ad-din also wrote that raynald 's fate shocked guy of lusignan , but saladin soon comforted him , stating that '' a king does not kill a king , but that man 's perfidy and insolence went too far '' the author of the estoire of eracles stated that raynald 's attack against a caravan at the turn of 1186 and 1187 was the '' reason of the loss of the kingdom of jerusalem '' among modern historians , bernard hamilton describes raynald as '' an experienced and responsible crusader leader '' who made several attempts to prevent saladin from uniting the muslim realms along the borders of the crusader states .
