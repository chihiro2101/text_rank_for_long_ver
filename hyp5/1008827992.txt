the other important aspect of the multiplier is that to the extent that government spending generates new consumption , it also generates '' new '' tax revenues the idea is that the total increase in production and income by all parties throughout the economy may be greater than the original increment to government spending , as additional resources are drawn into the circular flows of money spending and business activity through the economy the existence of idle capacity and involuntary unemployment of labor in the economy can be represented as an output gap—a difference between actual gdp and potential gdp—and a policy of fiscal stimulus may aim at introducing sufficient additional spending , amplified by the multiplier , to speed the closing of the output gap increased taxes exactly matched to increased spending might seem designed to draw out of the circulating flow of the economy an amount of income in taxes exactly equal to the amount being injected by additional government purchases increased borrowing to finance additional government purchases might also be supposed to be designed to draw out of the circulating flow an amount equal to the additional government purchases , perhaps by crowding out private borrowing for investment spending in the history of economic thought , the notion that any increase in government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending or investment , through taxation or borrowing , and thus has no net impact on economic activity , is known as the treasury view , and is regarded as generally fallacious the argument that the choice of taxes or borrowing to finance government spending must be equivalent in that taxpayers observe borrowing and save in anticipation of taxes to repay the borrowing is known as ricardian equivalence , and is sometimes cited as a rationale for believing that fiscal stimulus policy will be made futile by the reactions of rational consumers and businesses , reducing their spending or investing in exact proportion to increases in public spending , in a scenario similar to that envisioned in the treasury view whether an incremental increase to government spending will have a multiplier effect is thought to depend on circumstances in the economy : first , particularly on the extent to which unemployment of resources may be high , so that the additional demand represented by government purchases may be realized by additional production and higher utilization of resources , without bidding up prices ; second , by the state of the financial and credit markets , where demand for money and money instruments may welcome additional government debt as low-risk securities , but may regard investment in private production capacity or capital formation as too risky , given a low level of general business activity even a balanced budget fiscal stimulus—additional public purchases fully financed by equivalent increases in taxation without any additional public borrowing—may have a multiplier greater than 1 , as the increase in output and business activity reduces persistent unemployment and the anxiety driving hoarding , with resulting increases in private consumption and investment reducing the time it takes for the economy to return to full employment in such circumstances , policy to increase aggregate demand and total business activity by means of fiscal measures may treat additional purchases and reductions in taxes as interchangeable near equivalents , with the changes in the net difference between spending and taxation identified as the deficit-financed fiscal stimulus many economists subscribe to a consensus view in which monetary policy is preferred as a means of regulating the business cycle , and fiscal stimulus is regarded as effective only in circumstances in which monetary policy has become ineffective , because policy interest rates are approaching the zero lower bound or a liquidity trap has developed , in which the financial system is hoarding money and failing to finance risky investment in capital formation and increased output additional public borrowing and spending would tend to increase interest rates , because the monetary authority would increase interest rates in response to additional public borrowing and spending , in an effort to contain the effects on the level of public activity—to prevent overheating in the demand for resources and inflation , for example whether that would or should justify otherwise wasteful government spending is controversial , on the one hand , and on the other hand , whether the supposed wastefulness of government spending justifies reducing multiplier estimates that reflect only gdp effects to smaller estimates reflecting welfare effects , remains a matter of political controversy it is sometimes argued that if the money is borrowed , it must eventually be paid back with interest , such that the long-term effect on the economy depends on the trade off between the immediate increase to the gdp and the long-term cost of servicing the resulting government debt this finding is consistent with research suggesting that in today ’ s environment of substantial economic slack , monetary policy constrained by the zero lower bound , and synchronized fiscal adjustment across numerous economies , multipliers may be well above 1 : in answering the question , we are concerned with the aggregate impact of different types of fiscal tightening on gdp ( measured using so-called ‘ fiscal multipliers ’ ) and not simply the direct contribution that government investment and consumption of goods and services makes to the expenditure measure of gdp this phenomenon is argued to be less likely to occur in a recession , when the saving rate is traditionally higher and capital is not being fully utilized in the private market
