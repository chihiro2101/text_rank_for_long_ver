the term cabriolet originated from a carriage cabriolet : '' a light , two-wheeled , one-horse carriage with a folding top , capable of seating two persons '' , however the term is also used to describe other convertibles these days as car engines became more powerful by the end of the 19th century , folding textile or leather roofs ( as had been used on victoria or landau carriages ) began to appear on cars less expensive cars , such as the runabouts , sporting roadsters or sturdy touring cars , remained either completely open air or were fitted with a rudimentary folding top and detachable side curtains by the mid 1930s , the remaining small number of convertibles sold were high priced luxury models many other models also include a convertible body style in the model range other materials are also used in the convertible top rigid removable hardtops , many of which store in a car 's trunk/boot , have been around at least since the 1950s on early thunderbirds ( and corvettes through 1967 ) , buyers could choose between a detachable hardtop and a folding canvas top at no additional cost , but paid extra for both the metal-framed '' carson top '' was a popular addition for the 1930s ford convertibles or roadsters because it turned these models into an almost instant hardtop improvements in canvas tops have rendered the detachable hardtop less common in recent years , in part because the top can not be stored in the vehicle when not in use , requiring a garage or other storage facility a retractable hardtop — also known as '' coupé convertible '' or '' coupé cabriolet '' — is a car with an automatically operated , self-storing hardtop ( as opposed to the textile-based roof used by traditional convertibles ) traditionally , the rear window in a soft-top was made from plastic ; however , more recently some convertibles have used glass for the rear window modern safety features specifically for convertibles include : roll over protection structure with pyrotechnics roll hoops hidden behind the rear seats that deploy under rollover conditions heated rear window ( for improved visibility ) boron steel-reinforced a-pillars safety cage construction & nbsp ; – a horseshoe-like structure around the passenger compartment & nbsp ; door-mounted side-impact airbag which inflates upward ( instead of downward like the typical curtain airbag ) to provide head protection even with an open window convertibles have offered numerous iterations that fall between the first mechanically simple but attention-demanding fabric tops to highly complex modern retractable hardtops : roadster : a roadster ( also called spider or spyder ) is an open two-seat car with emphasis on sporting appearance or character as an example , citroën 's 1948 citroën 2cv featured rigid bodysides and two doors on each side , along with a sunroof that rolled back on itself and extended to the rear bumper in place of a separate trunk lid file : late model ford model t.jpg ford model t circa 1925 , with minimal weather protection file : bentley 4,5 litre sporting four seater 1929.jpg bentley 4½ litre 1929 with luxury snap-on and thumbscrew sidescreens file:1934 ford model 40 750 de luxe phaeton.jpg ford phaeton 1934 open four-door touring car file:1953.mg.td.arp.jpg mg td circa 1953 , with manual soft top and manually detachable sidescreens with clear plastic windows and perspex rear window file : lancia d23 spyder 1953.jpg lancia d23 spyder 1953 file:1955 porsche 550 spyder interior.jpg 1955 porsche 550 spyder jpg lincoln continental circa 1962 , four-door with integral automatically operating , self-storing tonneau file : ma 1963 e-type.jpg jaguar e-type 1963 , with vinyl foldable tonneau installed and snap-secured file:1971eldofront.jpg cadillac eldorado 1972 , with detachable , two-part , fully rigid '' parade boot '' tonneau cover file:2cv pinkdylan frome.jpg citroën 2cv fixed profile convertible circa 1975 , with roll-back roof and rigid doors file : may 2011 parade - beginning.jpeg zil-41047 parading on victory day 2011 file : volkswagen new beetle cabriolet red iaa 2003.jpg volkswagen new beetle circa 2003 , with raised textile ( cloth ) convertible top featuring interior headliner , an acoustic insulation layer , and heatable glass rear window file : porsche boxster hr silver.jpg porsche boxster circa 2004 , with detachable clear plastic windblocker and a z-fold top , automatically raiseable in 12 seconds and optional detachable aluminum hardtop ( not shown ) file : citroen c3 pluriel rear 20071104.jpg citroën c3 circa 2007 , a multiconfigurable convertible with roll-back textile roof and removable rigid sidebars file : fiat 500c 1.2 8v lounge – heckansicht , 16 , lightweight ) hardtop concealed by self-storing tonneau cover file : daihatsu.copen.arp.750pix.jpg daihatsu copen circa 2001 with retracted hardtop , qualifying for the ultra-compact japanese kei class file : paris 2006 - ford focus cc.jpg ford focus cc circa 2006 with its roof retracted , its final assembly performed by pininfarina file : chevrolet ssr.jpg chevrolet ssr circa 2004 , a retractable hardtop convertible pickup truck , its top engineered by american specialty cars file : volkswagen eos front-view.jpg volkswagen eos circa 2007 , the five-segment top features an independently sliding sunroof , made by oasys
