he started what would be a lifelong series of experiments with electrical phenomena and began to investigate what he thought was an electro-gravity phenomenon while still in high school brown was assigned from the naval research laboratory with the primary duties of sonar and radio operator and had little involvement in scientific work in 1933 brown lost his job at the naval research lab due to depression era budget cutbacks so he joined the u.s townsend brown , 2005-2006-2007-2008 - tanglewood books , chapter 43 - for the good of the service after 1944 he worked as a radar consultant to the vega aircraft corporation in 1952 brown moved to cleveland in hopes of selling his gravitor device to the military establishment but there was little interest in it brown became involved in the subject of unidentified flying objects ( ufos ) and in 1956 helped found the national investigations committee on aerial phenomena ( nicap ) although he was forced out as director in 1957 with allegations that brown was using funds to further his own anti-gravity research the canonical hamiltonian the intersection of chip design and physics by hamilton carter , thomas townsend brown : part iv of the holiday serial brown was convinced that he had managed to influence gravity electrically at caltech in 1923 brown tried to convince his instructors about his theories via inviting them to his home laboratory , but they showed little interest he also invited the press and the may 26 , 1924 edition los angeles evening express ran a story on brown titled '' claims gravity is a push , not a pull '' after quitting caltech brown studied one year at denison university where he claimed that he did a series of experiments with professor of astronomy paul alfred biefeld although the present day denison university claims they have no record of such experiments being carried out , or of any association between brown and biefeld in 1929 brown published '' how i control gravity '' , in science and invention , where he claimed these devices were producing a mysterious force that interacted with the pull of gravity brown spent the rest of his life working in his spare time and sometimes in funded projects trying to prove his ideas on electricity 's effect on gravity townsend brown , 2005-2006-2007-2008 - tanglewood books , chapter 64 : flying saucer pipe dreams ( online excerpts ) at some point it also gained the moniker '' biefeld–brown effect '' , probably coined by brown to claim biefeld as his mentor and co-experimenter martin company placed advertisements looking for scientists who were '' interested in gravity '' , but rapidly declined in popularity thereafter ( see united states gravity control propulsion research ) a physicist invited to observe brown 's disk device in the early 50s noted during the demonstration that its motivation force was the well known phenomenon of '' electric wind '' , and not anti-gravity , saying “ i ’ m afraid these gentlemen played hooky from their high school physics classes… chapter 10 of the book was titled '' the force fields of townsend brown '' , retelling of brown 's early work and claiming he was involved in the experiment and implying brown 's electrogravitics was the propulsion being used by ufos chapter six ufos and electrogravity propulsion , did tesla discover the secrets of antigravity ? brown 's research and the '' biefeld–brown effect '' has since become something of a popular pursuit around the world , with amateur experimenters replicating his early experiments in the form of '' ionocraft '' powered by high voltage
