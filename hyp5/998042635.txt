when division is explained at the elementary arithmetic level , it is often considered as splitting a set of objects into equal parts 598–668 ) is the earliest text to treat zero as a number in its own right and to define operations involving zero the four basic operations – addition , subtraction , multiplication and division – as applied to whole numbers ( positive integers ) , with some restrictions , in elementary arithmetic are used as a framework to support the extension of the realm of numbers to which they apply for instance , to make it possible to subtract any whole number from another , the realm of numbers must be expanded to the entire set of integers in order to incorporate the negative integers loosely speaking , since division by zero has no meaning ( is undefined ) in the whole number setting , this remains true as the setting expands to the real or even complex numbers for instance , in the realm of integers , subtraction is no longer considered a basic operation since it can be replaced by addition of signed numbers the next step is to define the rational numbers keeping in mind that this must be done using only the sets and operations that have already been established , namely , addition , multiplication and the integers suppes 's §8.5 the problem of division by zero begins this way : '' that everything is not for the best in this best of all possible worlds , even in mathematics , is well illustrated by the vexing problem of defining the operation of division in the elementary theory of arithmetic '' ( p he ends his chapter '' ( a discussion of this rather difficult problem exactly one number satisfying a definiens will be omitted here & nbsp ; 189 ) wherein he asks for a proof of the following : '' in section 53 , the definition of the number ' 0 ' was stated by way of an example to be certain this definition does not lead to a contradiction , it should be preceded by the following theorem : there exists exactly one number x such that , for any number y , one has : y + x y ''
