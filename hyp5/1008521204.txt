he described george washington as a '' high-flying aristocrat '' , and he found the aristocracy of money and achievement in america still less to his liking than the european aristocracy of birth finding himself at philadelphia in the company of reynolds , rowan , and tandy , tone went to paris to persuade the french government to send an expedition to invade ireland a commission was given him as adjutant-general in the french army , which he hoped might protect him from the penalty of treason in the event of capture by the british ;

if in consequence of the measures in which i have been engaged misfortunes have been brought upon this country , i heartily lament it , but let it be remembered that it is now nearly four years since i have quit ireland and consequently i have been personally concerned in none of them ; if i am rightly informed very great atrocities have been committed on both sides , but that does not at all diminish my regret ; for a fair and open war i was prepared ; if that has degenerated into a system of assassination , massacre , and plunder i do again most sincerely lament it , and those few who know me personally will give me i am sure credit for the assertion this was a remarkable act , given that the rebellion had just occurred with great loss of life , and one that could never be enlarged upon as kilwarden was killed at the beginning of emmet 's revolt in 1803 as a pillar of the protestant ascendancy and , as attorney-general for ireland the prosecutor of the case against united irishman william orr , kilwarden had no other obvious motive for trying to assist tone in 1795 and 1798 history ireland essay , 1998 , vol.6 ;
