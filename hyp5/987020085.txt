rosa figured that he would honor the written word best by sending the ducks on an epic quest for the library of alexandria , where he : : '' could show the evolution of books from papyrus scrolls through parchment tomes and the first gutenberg volumes on up to the present day and what could be better than for the key to tracing the library around the world be that most famous mythical book of all - the junior woodchuck guidebook ? !
