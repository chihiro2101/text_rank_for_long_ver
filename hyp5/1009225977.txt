the act declaring england to be a commonwealth , which established england , together with '' all the dominions and territoryes thereunto belonging '' , as a republic , had been passed on 19 may 1649 , following the trial and execution of charles i in january of that year the process of placing the governance of scotland on a more long term constitutional footing began shortly after the defeat of the scottish royalists and charles ii at the battle of worcester on 20 april 1653 , after learning that parliament was attempting to stay in session despite an agreement to dissolve , and having failed to come up with a working constitution , cromwell , with the backing of the grandees in the army council , marched soldiers into the debating chamber and forcibly ended the rump 's session within a month of the rump 's dismissal , oliver cromwell on the advice of thomas harrison and with the support of other officers in the army , sent a request to congregational churches in every county to nominate those they considered fit to take part in the new government however it proved just as difficult for the grandees to control and was in addition a subject of popular ridicule , so on 8 december 1653 mps who supported cromwell engineered its end by passing a dissolution motion at a time of day when the house usually had few members in attendance however , cromwell 's power was also buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army , which he had built up during the civil wars , and which he subsequently prudently guarded the first protectorate parliament met on 3 september 1654 , and after some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by cromwell , began to work on a moderate programme of constitutional reform their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by major general john desborough to provide financial backing for their work , which the second protectorate parliament—instated in september 1656—voted down for fear of a permanent military state it was this—allied to cromwell 's toleration of private worship of non-puritans—that led to his resettlement of the jews in england , 350 years after their banishment by edward i , in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the civil wars in 1657 , oliver cromwell was offered the crown by parliament as part of a revised constitutional settlement , presenting him with a dilemma , since he had been instrumental in abolishing the monarchy he was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out , but in a speech on 13 april 1657 he made clear that god 's providence had spoken against the office of king : “ i would not seek to set up that which providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust , and i would not build jericho again '' however , cromwell '' had never gained the willing consent of the nation '' and the protectorate relied on armed force three things undermined the protectorate : the '' anxieties of the army , the irresponsibility of the parliament and the rashness of richard cromwell '' ; what ultimately prevented the retention of the protectorate was the opposition of the '' junior officers '' and '' many of the common soldiers '' richard had proved he could neither manage the parliament nor control the army after richard cromwell was removed from power by the grandees of the new army , the rump parliament was instated and soon after was replaced by the committee of safety and council of state under the authority of charles fleetwood
