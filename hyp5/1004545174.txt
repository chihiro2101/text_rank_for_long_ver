to generate the key table , one would first fill in the spaces in the table ( a modified polybius square ) with the letters of the keyword ( dropping any duplicate letters ) , then fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the letters of the alphabet in order ( usually omitting '' j '' or '' q '' to reduce the alphabet to fit ; other versions put both '' i '' and '' j '' in the same space ) since encryption requires pairs of letters , messages with an odd number of characters usually append an uncommon letter , such as '' x '' , to complete the final digram to perform the substitution , apply the following 4 rules , in order , to each pair of letters in the plaintext : if both letters are the same ( or only one letter is left ) , add an '' x '' after the first letter some variants of playfair use '' q '' instead of '' x '' , but any letter , itself uncommon as a repeated pair , will do the order is important – the first letter of the encrypted pair is the one that lies on the same row as the first letter of the plaintext pair when only the ciphertext is known , brute force cryptanalysis of the cipher involves searching through the key space for matches between the frequency of occurrence of digrams ( pairs of letters ) and the known frequency of occurrence of digrams in the assumed language of the original message identifying nearby reversed digraphs in the ciphertext and matching the pattern to a list of known plaintext words containing the pattern is an easy way to generate possible plaintext strings with which to begin constructing the key switching letters , rows , or reflecting the entire square ) to see if the candidate plaintext is more like standard plaintext than before the change ( perhaps by comparing the digrams to a known frequency chart ) this is obviously beyond the range of typical human patience , but computers can adopt this algorithm to crack playfair ciphers with a relatively small amount of text if there are no double letter digrams in the ciphertext and the length of the message is long enough to make this statistically significant , it is very likely that the method of encryption is playfair a good tutorial on reconstructing the key for a playfair cipher can be found in chapter 7 , '' solution to polygraphic substitution systems , '' of field manual 34-40-2 , produced by the united states army in this story , a playfair message is demonstrated to be cryptographically weak , as the detective is able to solve for the entire key making only a few guesses as to the formatting of the message ( in this case , that the message starts with the name of a city and then a date ) they adapted it by introducing a second square from which the second letter of each bigram was selected , and dispensed with the keyword , placing the letters in random order as the german numbers 1 ( eins ) to twelve ( zwölf ) contain all but eight of the letters in the double playfair squares , pro forma traffic was relatively easy to break ( smith , page 74-75 ) listener crossword database normally between four and six answers have to be entered into the grid in code , and the playfair keyphrase is thematically significant to the final solution but the way the cipher is used is always the same
