a deliberative assembly may form a committee ( or '' commission '' ) consisting of one or more persons to assist with the work of the assembly committees can serve several different functions : ; governance : in organizations considered too large for all the members to participate in decisions affecting the organization as a whole , a smaller body , such as a board of directors , is given the power to make decisions , spend money , or take actions a governance committee is formed as a separate committee to review the performance of the board and board policy as well as nominate candidates for the board for example , an organization considering a major capital investment might create a temporary working committee of several people to review options and make recommendations to upper management or the board of directors sometimes these meetings are held through videoconferencing or other means if committee members are not able to attend in person , as may be the case if they are in different parts of the country or the world however , some bodies require that committees take minutes , especially if the committees are public ones subject to open meeting laws if the committee is not ready to report , it may provide a partial report or the assembly may discharge the committee of the matter so that the assembly can handle it whether the committee continues to exist after presenting its report depends on the type of committee generally , committees established by the bylaws or the organization 's rules continue to exist , while committees formed for a particular purpose go out of existence after the final report a motion to commit should specify to which committee the matter is to be referred , and if the committee is a special committee appointed specifically for purposes of the referred motion , it should also specify the number of committee members and the method of their selection , unless that is specified in the bylaws any proposed amendments to the main motion that are pending at the time the motion is referred to a committee go to the committee as well in robert 's rules of order newly revised ( ronr ) , the motion to commit has three variations which do not turn a question over to a smaller group , but simply permit the assembly 's full meeting body to consider it with the greater freedom of debate that is allowed to committees in robert 's rules of order newly revised , the motion to discharge a committee is used to take a matter out of a committee 's hands before the committee has made a final report on it under the standard code of parliamentary procedure , the assembly that has referred a motion or a matter to a committee may , by a majority vote , withdraw it at any time from the committee , refer it to another committee , or decide the question itself the executive committee may function more like a board than an actual committee in organizations , the term '' conference committee '' may have a different meaning a standing committee is a subunit of a political or deliberative body established in a permanent fashion to aid the parent assembly in accomplishing its duties , for example by meeting on a specific , permanent policy domain ( e.g a standing committee is granted its scope and powers over a particular area of business by the governing documents standing committees meet on a regular or irregular basis depending on their function , and retain any power or oversight originally given them until subsequent official actions of the governing body ( through changes to law or by-laws ) disbands the committee the legislative reorganization act of 1946 greatly reduced the number of committees , and set up the legislative committee structure still in use today , as modified by authorized changes via the orderly mechanism of rules changes these committees continue to exist after presenting their reports , although the membership in the committees may change a special committee ( or working , select , or ad hoc committee ) is established to accomplish a particular task or to oversee a specific area in need of control or oversight once the committee makes its final report to its parent body , the special committee ceases to exist
