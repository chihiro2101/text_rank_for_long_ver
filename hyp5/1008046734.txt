in 1952 , his father began working for the cia 's directorate of operations in virginia , and in 1953 was posted to southeast asia for three years , accompanied by his family carleton received a '' particularly negative performance appraisal '' in part because of serious alcoholism and spent the remainder of his career at cia headquarters beginning in 1957 , following his sophomore year , he worked for the cia for three summers as a low-ranking ( gs-3 ) records analyst , marking classified documents for filing however , a bright point in that assignment was ames 's handling of a czech asset , preventing his recapture , which so impressed ames 's superiors that he was recommended for a more demanding assignment in 1976 , ames was assigned to new york city where he handled two important soviet assets despite cia regulations , ames did not report his romance with a foreign national to his superiors , even though some of his colleagues were aware of it ames thought the divorce might bankrupt him , and later said that this financial pressure was what had first led him to consider spying for the soviet union ames routinely assisted another cia office that assessed soviet embassy officials as potential intelligence assets as part of this responsibility , and with the knowledge of both the cia and the fbi , ames began making contacts within the soviet embassy in april 1985 , ames provided information to the soviets that he believed was '' essentially valueless '' but would establish his credentials as a cia insider he also asked for 50,000 , which the soviets paid quickly ames later claimed that he had not prepared for more than the initial '' con game '' to satisfy his immediate indebtedness , but having '' crossed a line '' he '' could never step back '' ames soon identified more than ten top-level cia and fbi sources who were reporting on soviet activities not only did ames believe that there was '' as much money as he could ever use '' in betraying these intelligence assets , but their elimination would also reduce the chance of his own espionage being discovered double agent , simon & schuster , the cia initially blamed asset losses on another former cia agent , edward lee howard , who had also been passing information to the soviets however , when the cia lost three other important assets about whom howard could have known nothing , it was clear that the arrests ( and executions ) were the result of information provided by another source as one cia officer put it , the soviets '' were wrapping up our cases with reckless abandon '' , which was highly unusual because the '' prevailing wisdom among the agency 's professional 'spy catchers ' '' was that suddenly eliminating all the assets known to the mole would put him in danger in fact , ames 's kgb handlers apologized to him , saying they disagreed with that course of action , but that the decision to immediately eliminate all american assets had been made at the highest political levels ultimately , ames received 4.6 million from the soviets , which allowed him to enjoy a lifestyle well beyond the means of a cia officer a 1994 report by the washington post , however , stated that '' after six weeks of questioning ames an fbi report later stated that ames had not advised the soviets about gordievsky until 13 june 1985 ; by that time , the spy was under kgb surveillance but he was not charged with treason as of 19 july 1985 when mi6 agents began to exfiltrate him to britain in 1986 , following the loss of several cia assets , ames told the kgb that he feared he would be a suspect mole hunters investigated ninety employees at wtc for almost a year and came up with ten suspects , although the lead investigator noted that '' there are so many problem personalities that no one stands out '' nevertheless , in 1990–1991 , he was reassigned to the cia 's counterintelligence center analysis group , providing him with access to '' extremely sensitive data '' , including information on u.s prior to that , in november 1989 , a fellow employee reported that ames seemed to be enjoying a lifestyle well beyond the means of a cia officer , and that his wife 's family was less wealthy than he had claimed when the investigator assigned to look at ames 's finances began a two-month training course , no one immediately replaced him investigators were also diverted by a false story from a cia officer abroad who claimed that the soviets had penetrated the cia with an employee born in the ussr '' assessment , '' 44–45 ; the kgb instructed ames to get '' a real good night 's sleep also , according to early , except for a handful of staff members , the cia had largely abandoned trying to solve the case , and more credit for the resolution should be given the fbi at his arrest , ames told the officers , '' you 're making a big mistake ! you must have the wrong man ! '' on february 22 , 1994 , ames and his wife were formally charged by the department of justice with spying for the soviet union and russia in court , ames admitted that he had compromised '' virtually all soviet agents of the cia and other american and foreign services known to me '' , and had provided the ussr and russia with a '' huge quantity of information on united states foreign , defense and security policies '' some of this '' feed material '' was incorporated into cia intelligence reports , several of which even reached three presidents ames said he was not afraid of being caught by the fbi or cia but was afraid of soviet defectors , saying , '' virtually every american who has been jailed in connection with espionage has been fingered by a soviet source '' the cia was criticized for not focusing on ames sooner , given the obvious increase in his standard of living there was a '' huge uproar '' in congress when cia director james woolsey decided that no one in the agency would be dismissed or demoted in a 2004 interview with howard hart , who was the cia station chief of bonn , west germany in the late 1980s , it was revealed that in 1988 , ames also betrayed a mikoyan engineer who had been working with the cia for fourteen years , and had provided complete technical , test , and research data on all of the soviet union 's fighter jets eitan stated that pollard never exposed american agents in the soviet union or elsewhere and that he believed ames tried to blame pollard to clear himself of suspicion eitan said '' i have no doubt that had pollard been tried today , in light of what is known about ames and other agents who were exposed , he would have received a much lighter sentence '' ames was also mentioned in the 2003 film the recruit , which uses the examples of ames , nicholson and howard , to examine the ways in which the cia works to prevent external espionage , but is , and always will be , subject to internal espionage ames is also a subject of thematic card in a cold war related board game twilight struggle
