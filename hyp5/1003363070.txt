instead , dram memories came onto the market in the early 1970s that rapidly replaced all previous random access memory systems one interesting side-effect of the twistor concept was noticed in production ; under certain conditions , passing a current through one of the electrical wires running inside the tape would cause the magnetic fields on the tape to move in the direction of the current if used properly , it allowed the stored bits to be pushed down the tape and pop off the end , forming a type of delay line memory , but one where the propagation of the fields was under computer control , as opposed to automatically advancing at a set rate defined by the materials used the memory density of twistor was a function of the size of the wires ; the length of any one wire determined how many bits it held , and many such wires were laid side-by-side to produce a larger memory system this led to the possibility of making a memory system similar to the moving-domain twistor concept , but using a single block of magnetic material instead of many twistor wires these bubbles were much smaller than the domains of normal media like tape , which suggested that very high area densities were possible five significant discoveries took place at bell labs : the controlled two-dimensional motion of single wall domains in permalloy films the application of orthoferrites the discovery of the stable cylindrical domain the invention of the field access mode of operation the discovery of growth-induced uniaxial anisotropy in the garnet system and the realization that garnets would be a practical material the bubble system can not be described by any single invention , but in terms of the above discoveries when a small magnetic field was applied , they would become magnetized , and the bubbles would '' stick '' to one end better yet , bubble memory devices needed no moving parts : the field that pushed the bubbles along the surface was generated electrically , whereas media like tape and disk drives required mechanical movement finally , because of the small size of the bubbles , the density was in theory much higher than existing magnetic storage devices in fact , it seemed that bubble memory would soon be the only form of memory used in the vast majority of applications , with the high-performance market being the only one they could not serve by the early 1980s , however , bubble memory technology became a dead end with the introduction of hard disk systems offering higher storage densities , higher access speeds , and lower costs tie communication used it in the early development of digital phone systems in order to lower their mtbf rates and produce a non-volatile telephone system 's central processor the bubble logic would use nanotechnology and has been demonstrated to have access times of 7 & nbsp ; ms , which is faster than the 10 & nbsp ; ms access times that present hard drives have , though it is slower than the access time of traditional ram and of traditional logic circuits , making the proposal not commercially practical at present
