the central idea of this program was that if we could give finitary proofs of consistency for all the sophisticated formal theories needed by mathematicians , then we could ground these theories by means of a metamathematical argument , which shows that all of their purely universal assertions ( more technically their provable arithmetical hierarchy ) are finitarily true ; once so grounded we do not care about the non-finitary meaning of their existential theorems , regarding these as pseudo-meaningful stipulations of the existence of ideal entities the failure of the program was induced by kurt gödel 's incompleteness theorems , which showed that any ω-consistent theory that is sufficiently strong to express certain simple arithmetic truths , can not prove its own consistency , which on gödel 's formulation is a \pi^0_1 sentence barkley rosser 's refinement , weakening the above requirement of ω-consistency to simple consistency ; axiomatisation of the core of gödel 's result in terms of a modal language , provability logic ; transfinite iteration of theories , due to alan turing and solomon feferman ; the discovery of self-verifying theories , systems strong enough to talk about themselves , but too weak to carry out the diagonal lemma that is the key to gödel 's unprovability argument jan łukasiewicz suggested in 1926 that one could improve on hilbert systems as a basis for the axiomatic presentation of logic if one allowed the drawing of conclusions from assumptions in the inference rules of the logic and went on to make fundamental advances in the formalisation of intuitionistic logic , and provide the first combinatorial proof of the consistency of peano arithmetic together , the presentation of natural deduction and the sequent calculus introduced the fundamental idea of analytic proof to proof theory gentzen 's natural deduction calculus also supports a notion of analytic proof , as shown by dag prawitz the definition is slightly more complex : we say the analytic proofs are the normal forms , which are related to the notion of normal form in term rewriting structural proof theory is connected to type theory by means of the curry–howard correspondence , which observes a structural analogy between the process of normalisation in the natural deduction calculus and beta reduction in the typed lambda calculus other research topics in structural theory include analytic tableau , which apply the central idea of analytic proof from structural proof theory to provide decision procedures and semi-decision procedures for a wide range of logics , and the proof theory of substructural logics ordinal analysis allows one to measure precisely the infinitary content of the consistency of theories consequences of ordinal analysis include ( 1 ) consistency of subsystems of classical second order arithmetic and set theory relative to constructive theories , ( 2 ) combinatorial independence results , and ( 3 ) classifications of provably total recursive functions and provably well-founded ordinals the first breakthrough in this direction was takeuti 's proof of the consistency of π-ca 0 using the method of ordinal diagrams reverse mathematics is a program in mathematical logic that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics the reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the axiom of choice and zorn 's lemma are equivalent over zf set theory the goal of reverse mathematics , however , is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory research in reverse mathematics often incorporates methods and techniques from recursion theory as well as proof theory these interpretations contribute to a form of hilbert 's program , since they prove the consistency of classical theories relative to constructive ones functional interpretations also provide a way to extract constructive information from proofs in the reduced theory checking formal proofs is usually simple , whereas finding proofs ( automated theorem proving ) is generally hard intermediate logic model theory proof ( truth ) proof techniques
