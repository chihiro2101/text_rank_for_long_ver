from the outset , theories of heteronormativity included a critical look at gender ; warner wrote that '' every person who comes to a queer self-understanding knows in one way or another that her stigmatization is intricated with gender 5 may 2008 heteronormativity describes how social institutions and policies reinforce the presumption that people are heterosexual and that gender and sex are natural binaries following berlant and warner , laurie and stark also argue that the domestic '' intimate sphere '' becomes '' the unquestioned non‐place that anchors heteronormative public discourses , especially those concerning marriage and adoption rights '' according to cultural anthropologist gayle rubin , heteronormativity in mainstream society creates a '' sex hierarchy '' that graduates sexual practices from morally '' good sex '' to '' bad sex '' the hierarchy places reproductive , monogamous sex between committed heterosexuals as '' good '' and places any sexual acts and individuals who fall short of this standard lower until they fall into '' bad sex '' patrick mccreery , lecturer at new york university , views this hierarchy as partially explanatory for the stigmatization of gay people for socially '' deviant '' sexual practices that are often practiced by straight people as well , such as consumption of pornography or sex in public places mccreery states that this heteronormative hierarchy carries over to the workplace , where gay , lesbian and bisexual individuals face discrimination such as anti-homosexual hiring policies or workplace discrimination that often leaves '' lowest hierarchy '' individuals such as transsexual people vulnerable to the most overt discrimination and unable to find work applicants and current employees can be legally passed over or fired for being non-heterosexual or perceived as non-heterosexual in many countries , such as the case with chain restaurant cracker barrel , which cracker barrel lgbt policies after they fired an employee for being openly lesbian , citing their policy that employees with '' sexual preferences that fail to demonstrate normal heterosexual values were inconsistent with traditional american values shared earning/shared parenting marriage ( also known as peer marriage ) where two heterosexual parents are both providers of resources and nurturers to children has become popular societal factors influence adults to search for a partner of the opposite sex to engage in heterosexual marriage with the goal of having children through the traditional nuclear family structure schalet , it seems that the bulk of parent-child sex education revolves around abstinence only practices in the united states , but this differs in other parts of the world the child is then usually raised and enculturated as a cisgender heterosexual member of the assigned sex , which may or may not match their emergent gender identity throughout life or some remaining sex characteristics ( for example , chromosomes , genes or internal sex organs ) ' a certain kind of freedom : power and the truth of bodies – four essays on gender '' an umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from what is typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth '' '' usi lgbt campaign – transgender campaign '' ( retrieved 11 january 2012 ) defines transgender people as '' people who were assigned a sex , usually at birth and based on their genitals , but who feel that this is a false or incomplete description of themselves '' transgender is also an umbrella term because , in addition to including trans men and trans women whose gender binary identity is the opposite of their assigned sex ( and who are sometimes specifically termed transsexual if they desire medical assistance to transition ) , it may include genderqueer people ( whose identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine , but may , for example , be bigender , pangender , genderfluid , or agender ) other definitions include third-gender people as transgender or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender , susan stryker , stephen whittle , the

transgender people although transgender studies scholar susan stryker , in her article '' transgender history , homonormativity , and disciplinary '' , noted that it was also used by transgender activists in the 1990s in reference to the imposition of gay/lesbian norms over the concerns of transgender people in addition , homonormativity can be used today to cover or erase the radical politics of the queer community during the gay liberation , by not only replacing these politics with more conservative goals like marriage equality and adoption rights , but also commercializing and mainstreaming queer subcultures for example , one empirical study found that in the netherlands , transgender people and other gender non-conforming lgbt people are often looked down upon within their communities for not acting '' normal '' five different studies have shown that gay characters appearing on tv decreases the prejudice among viewers in today 's media , specifically television , heterosexual character are used more often than homosexual characters media portrays heterosexuality as '' normal '' in today 's society so we see less homosexuality on television because of this for example , mainstream media promote the idea that gay men are more likely to be attracted to advertisements that sell expensive , flamboyant , and possibly feminine products because of their assumed attitudes and way of life television shows are also another aspect of media where there are stereotypes and negatively represented homosexuals
