the english use of stadium comes from the tiered infrastructure surrounding a roman track of such length the first stadiums to be built in the modern era were basic facilities , designed for the single purpose of fitting as many spectators in as possible with tremendous growth in the popularity of organised sport in the late victorian era , especially association football in the united kingdom and baseball in the united states , the first such structures were built all of the 19th-century wooden parks were replaced , some after only a few years , and none survive today the ground was originally designed with a capacity of 100,000 spectators and featured seating in the south stand under cover , while the remaining three stands were left as terraces and uncovered these early venues , originally designed to host football matches , were adopted for use by the olympic games , the first one being held in 1896 in athens , greece the white city stadium , built for the 1908 summer olympics in london is often cited as the first modern seater stadium , at least in the uk during these decades , parallel stadium developments were taking place in the u.s the baker bowl , a baseball park in philadelphia that opened in its original form in 1887 but was completely rebuilt in 1895 , broke new ground in stadium construction in two major ways the stadium 's second incarnation featured the world 's first cantilevered second deck ( tier ) in a sports venue , and was the first baseball park to use steel and brick for the majority of its construction it was the world 's first stadium to use concrete-and-steel construction but , in the context of sports stadiums , the term '' dome '' has become standard for all covered stadiums , '' dome '' , merriam-webster particularly because the first such enclosed stadium , the houston astrodome , was built with an actual dome-shaped roof even though enclosed , dome stadiums are called stadiums because they are large enough for , and designed for , what are generally considered to be outdoor sports such as athletics , american football , association football , rugby , and baseball stadiums built specifically for association football are common in europe ; gaelic games stadiums , such as croke park , are common in ireland , while stadia built specifically for baseball or american football are common in the united states the most common multiple use design combines a football pitch with a running track , although certain compromises must be made all three configurations ( open , oval and horseshoe ) are common , especially in the case of american college football stadiums rectangular stadiums are more common in europe , especially for football where many stadiums have four often distinct and very different stands on the four sides of the stadium the vastly differing character of european football stadiums has led to the growing hobby of ground hopping where spectators make a journey to visit the stadium for itself rather than for the event held there in recent years the trend of building completely new oval stadiums in europe has led to traditionalists criticising the designs as bland and lacking in the character of the old stadiums they replace in north america , where baseball and american football are the two most popular outdoor spectator sports , a number of football/baseball multi-use stadiums were built , especially during the 1960s , and some of them were successful however , since the requirements for baseball and football are significantly different , the trend has been toward the construction of single-purpose stadiums , beginning with truman sports complex and accelerating in the 1990s in several cases , an american football stadium has been constructed adjacent to a baseball park , to allow for the sharing of mutual parking lots and other amenities with the rise of mls , the construction of soccer-specific stadiums has also increased since the late 1990s to better fit the needs of that sport in many cases , earlier baseball stadiums were constructed to fit into a particular land area or city block since the development of electrical grids , lighting has been an important element in stadium design , allowing games to be played after sundown , and in covered , or partly covered stadiums that allow less natural light , but provide more shelter for the public in europe and south america , during the twentieth century , it was common for violent bands of supporters to fight inside or close to association football stadiums in north america , with its closed-league '' franchise '' system , there are fewer teams than cities which would like them '' the dow of professional sports '' harvard magazine in europe and latin america , where there are multiple association football clubs in any given city , and several leagues in each country , no such monopoly power exists , and stadiums are built primarily with private money in recent decades , to help take the burden of the massive expense of building and maintaining a stadium , many american and european sports teams have sold the rights to the name of the facility this trend , which began in the 1970s , but accelerated greatly in the 1990s , has led to sponsors ' names being affixed to both established stadiums and new ones in some cases , the corporate name replaces ( with varying degrees of success ) the name by which the venue has been known for many years in recent years , some government-owned stadiums have also been subject to naming-rights agreements , with some or all of the revenue often going to the team ( s ) that play there san francisco 's historic candlestick park was renamed as 3com for several years , but the name was dropped when the sponsorship agreement expired , and it was another two years before the new name of monster cable products ' monster park was applied on the other hand , los angeles ' great western forum , one of the earliest examples of corporate renaming , retained its name for many years , even after the namesake bank no longer existed , the corporate name being dropped only after the building later changed ownership this new trend in corporate naming ( or renaming ) is distinguishable from names of some older venues , such as crosley field , wrigley field , and the first and second busch stadiums , in that the parks were named by and for the club 's owner , which also happened to be the name of the company owned by those clubowners
