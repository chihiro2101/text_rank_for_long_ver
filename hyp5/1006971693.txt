these fresh converts—zealous for their new faith—were in fact a sort of new movement within swiss anabaptism in 1693 , jakob ammann , '' together with the ministers and elders , '' sent a general letter to people within the swiss brethren congregations , asking for a meeting in which he wanted clarification about where they stood on three issues : 1 ) shunning those who had been banned , 2 ) whether liars should be excommunicated , and 3 ) if people could be saved who did not follow god ’ s word however , other issues surfaced during the discussions in the following years , including frequency of communion and how church discipline should be conducted at first , a few of the swiss ministers agreed with ammann ’ s view , but in a later meeting hans reist would not agree with social avoidance , using matthew 15:17 as a basis for '' what enters the mouth is no sin within a few years , several attempts were made at reconciliation also , they felt that they should not have excommunicated the swiss ministers on the spot , but should have consulted with the whole congregation before proceeding some of the other issues had been accepted by the swiss ministers , but the main body of amish and the reist side were never able to reconcile on the issue of social shunning however , official sharing of ministry and communion is rare among the most conservative groups of old order amish and mennonites
