the torii , a gateway erected on the approach to every shinto shrine , may be derived from the indian word torana according to several scholars , the vast evidence shows how the torii , both etymologically and architecturally , were originally derived from the torana , a free-standing sacred ceremonial gateway which marks the entrance of a sacred enclosure , such as hindu-buddhist temple or shrine , or city for this reason , the road leading to a shinto shrine ( sandō ) is almost always straddled by one or more torii , which are therefore the easiest way to distinguish a shrine from a buddhist temple the following ones , closer to the shrine , are usually called , in order , and also , because of the strong relationship between shinto shrines and the japanese imperial family , a torii stands also in front of the tomb of each emperor in the past torii must have been used also at the entrance of buddhist temples for this reason halls dedicated to her can be found at both temples and shrines , and in either case in front of the hall stands a torii the torii is also sometimes used as a symbol of japan in non-religious contexts these structures however can assume a great variety of forms , only some of which actually somewhat resemble a torii unlike its chinese counterpart , the hongsal-mun does not vary greatly in design and is always painted red , with '' arrowsticks '' located on the top of the structure ( hence the name ) another hypothesis takes the name literally : the gate would originally have been some kind of bird perch this is based on the religious use of bird perches in asia , such as the korean sotdae ( 솟대 ) , which are poles with one or more wooden birds resting on their top although they do not look like torii and serve a different function , these '' bird perches '' show how birds in several asian cultures are believed to have magic or spiritual properties , and may therefore help explain the enigmatic literal meaning of the torii 's name ( '' bird perch '' ) torii used to be also called poles believed to have supported wooden bird figures very similar to the sotdae have been found together with wooden birds , and are believed by some historians to have somehow evolved into today 's torii in japan birds have also long had a connection with the dead , this may mean it was born in connection with some prehistorical funerary rite many later texts also show some relationship between dead souls and white birds , a link common also in other cultures , shamanic like the japanese the first torii could have evolved already with their present function through the following sequence of events : four posts were placed at the corners of a sacred area and connected with a rope , thus dividing sacred and mundane this hypothetical stage corresponds to a type of torii in actual use , the so-called , an example of which can be seen in front of ōmiwa shrine 's haiden in nara ( see also the photo in the gallery ) because the gate was structurally weak , it was reinforced with a tie-beam , and what is today called or ( see illustration at right ) was born kamakura 's kamakura-gū for example has a white and red one at the center of the nuki there may be a supporting strut called , sometimes covered by a tablet carrying the name of the shrine ( see photo in the gallery ) the pillars often rest on a white stone ring called or the gate has a purely symbolic function and therefore there usually are no doors or board fences , but exceptions exist , as for example in the case of ōmiwa shrine 's triple-arched torii ( miwa torii , see below ) probably one of the oldest types of torii , it consists of two posts with a sacred rope called shimenawa tied between them the , which gives the name to the family , is constituted solely by a lintel ( kasagi ) and two pillars ( hashira ) united by a tie beam ( nuki ) the style takes its name from kasuga-taisha 's , or main torii almost identical to a kasuga torii ( see illustration above ) , but with the two upper lintels at a slant , the first appeared during the heian period the name comes from the fact that this type of torii is often used at hachiman shrines the ( see illustration above ) is a type of torii which appears to be formed from three individual torii ( see gallery ) also called , or ( see illustration above ) , the is composed of three myōjin torii without inclination of the pillars also called , or , the is a daiwa torii whose pillars are reinforced on both sides by square posts ( see illustration above ) the famous torii rising from the water at itsukushima is a ryōbu torii , and the shrine used to be also a shingon buddhist temple , so much so that it still has a tō the example in the gallery below is the main torii at : ja : 千栗八幡宮 in saga prefecture , and a city-designated important cultural property
