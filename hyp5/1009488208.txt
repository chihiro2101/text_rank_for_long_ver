this heightened inter-ethnic tensions as the malay people found that ethnic chinese had replaced them in certain jobs and work became more difficult to find one example was a 24-hour general strike organised by the mcp on 29 january 1946 eric stahl , '' doomed from the start : a new perspective on the malayan insurgency '' ( master 's thesis , 2003 ) during this time , the british administration was attempting to organise malaya 's economy , as revenue from malaya 's tin and rubber industries was important to britain 's own post-war recovery immediately after the war , the british authorities had set up the malayan union , a state where all citizens , malay , chinese and indian , would have equal rights this was rejected by many ethnic malays and by the rulers of the various protected states under effective british control in 1948 the british replaced the malayan union with the federation of malaya which reduced chinese influence and for many chinese this appeared as a betrayal after their community had borne the brunt of fighting the japanese occupation the mnla was organised into regiments , although these had no fixed establishments and each included all communist forces operating in a particular region the mnla also stipulated that their soldiers needed official permission for any romantic involvement with civilian women in the early stages of the conflict , the guerrillas envisaged establishing control in '' liberated areas '' from which the government forces had been driven , but did not succeed in this on the military front , the security forces did not know how to fight an enemy moving freely in the jungle and enjoying support from the chinese rural population the initial government strategy was primarily to guard important economic targets , such as mines and plantation estates the central tenet of the briggs plan was that the best way to defeat an insurgency , such as the government was facing , was to cut the insurgents off from their supporters amongst the population a major part of the strategy involved targeting the mnla food supply , which briggs recognised came from three main sources : camps within the malayan jungle where land was cleared to provide food , aboriginal jungle dwellers who could supply the mnla with food gathered within the jungle , and the mnla supporters within the 'squatter ' communities on the edge of the jungle it was templer who is widely credited with turning the situation in favour of the british forces many of the captured guerrillas changed sides during templer 's two-year command , '' two-thirds of the guerrillas were wiped out and lost over half their strength , the incident rate fell from 500 to less than 100 per month and the civilian and security force casualties from 200 to less than 40 '' orthodox historiography suggests that templer changed the situation in the emergency and his actions and policies were a major part of british success during his period in command in the end , the conflict involved a maximum of 40,000 british and other commonwealth troops , against a peak of about 7–8,000 communist guerrillas at all levels of the malayan government ( national , state , and district levels ) , the military and civil authority was assumed by a committee of military , police and civilian administration officials in addition to british and malayan units and personnel , a range of commonwealth forces were also involved , including troops from australia , new zealand , fiji , kenya , nyasaland , and northern and southern rhodesia in november 1955 133 soldiers of what was to become the special air service of new zealand arrived from singapore , for training in-country with the british sas , beginning operations by april 1956 the killing has been described as a major factor in causing the malayan population to roundly reject the mnla campaign , and also as leading to widespread fear due to the perception that '' if even the high commissioner was no longer safe , there was little hope of protection and safety for the man-in-the-street in malaya '' later , mnla leader chin peng stated that the killing had little effect and that the communists were already altering their strategy , according to new guidelines enshrined in the so-called '' october resolutions '' the october resolutions , a response to the briggs plan , involved a change of tactics by the mpla by reducing attacks on economic targets and civilians , increasing efforts to go into political organisation and subversion , and bolstering the supply network from the min yuen as well as jungle farming gurney 's successor , lieutenant general gerald templer , was instructed by the british government to push for immediate measures to give chinese ethnic residents the right to vote you may surrender now and to whom you like including to members of the public alliance ministers in the federal government travelled extensively up and down the country exhorting the people to call upon the communists to lay down their arms and take advantage of the amnesty realising that the tide of the war was turning against him , chin peng indicated that he would be ready to meet with british officials alongside senior malayan politicians in 1955 as a result , the conflict heightened , and , in response , new zealand sent nzsas soldiers , no macgillivray to the secretary of state for the colonies , 15 march 1956 , co1030/22 despite the failure of the talks , the mcp made every effort to resume peace talks with the malayan government , without success meanwhile , discussions began in the new emergency operations council to intensify the '' people 's war '' against the guerillas in july 1957 , a few weeks before independence , the mcp made another attempt at peace talks , suggesting the following conditions for a negotiated peace : its members should be given privileges enjoyed by citizens a guarantee that political as well as armed members of the mcp would not be punished the failure of the talks affected mcp policy on 31 july 1960 the malayan government declared the state of emergency was over , and chin peng left south thailand for beijing where he was accommodated by the chinese authorities in the international liaison bureau , where many other southeast asian communist party leaders were housed brian lapping said that there was '' some vicious conduct by the british forces , who routinely beat up chinese squatting when they refused , or possibly were unable , to give information '' about the insurgents some civilians and detainees were also shot , either because they attempted to flee from and potentially aid insurgents or simply because they refused to give intelligence to british forces these tactics strained relations between civilians and british forces in malaya and were therefore counterproductive in generating the one resource critical in a counterinsurgency , good intelligence the other forgotten war : understanding atrocities during the malayan emergency british troops were often unable to tell the difference between enemy combatants and non-combatant civilians while conducting military operations through the jungles , due to the fact the guerrillas wore civilian clothing and had support from sympathetic civilian populations the massacre later became the focus of decades of legal battles between the uk government and the families of the civilians executed by british troops decapitation of suspected insurgents by british forces was also common practice as a way to identify dead guerrillas when it was not possible to bring their corpses in from the jungle a photograph of a royal marine commando holding two insurgents ' heads caused a public outcry in april 1952 as part of briggs ' plan devised by british general sir harold briggs , 500,000 people ( roughly ten percent of malaya 's population ) were eventually removed from the land over the course of the war some 30,000 mostly ethnic chinese were deported by the british authorities to mainland china image : jungle service dress.jpg thumb upright 0.8 jungle service dress of the somerset light infantry used in the emergency the conflicts in malaya and vietnam have often been compared , with historians asking how a british force of 35,000 succeeded to quell a communist insurgency in malaya , while over half a million u.s 211 and the people 's republic of china ( prc ) provided large amounts of the latest military hardware , logistical support , personnel and training to north vietnam , whereas the mnla received no material support , weapons or training from any foreign government or party britain did n't approach the emergency as a conventional conflict and quickly implemented an effective intelligence strategy , led by the malayan police special branch , and a systematic hearts and minds operation , both of which proved effective against the largely political aims of the guerrilla movement however , the more numerous indigenous malays , many of whom were animated by anti-chinese sentiments , remained largely loyal to the government and enlisted in high numbers into the security services thus there was a bond of trust between many malays and the british forces who had fought alongside them and overthrown the japanese occupiers , whereas no such bond or gratitude existed between the population of vietnam and either the french colonial authorities or , later , the americans ) even though many british soldiers were conscripted national servicemen , the necessary skills and attitudes were taught at a jungle warfare school , which also developed the optimum tactics based on experience gained in the field in vietnam , soldiers and supplies passed through external countries such as laos and cambodia where us forces were not legally permitted to enter this allowed vietnamese communist troops safe haven from us ground attacks many tactics used by the americans in vietnam were similar to those used by the british in malaya however , after this strategy failed , the use of herbicides and defoliants in effort to fight the insurgents was restarted under the command of british general gerald templer in february 1953 , as a means of destroying food crops grown by communist forces in jungle clearings an estimated 10,000 civilians and insurgents in malaya also suffered from the effects of the defoliant ( though many historians think the number is much larger , given that agent orange was used on a large scale in the malayan conflict and , unlike the us , the british government limited information about its use to avoid negative world public opinion ) after the malayan conflict ended in 1960 , the us used the british precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a law of war like the us air force in vietnam , widespread saturation bombardment was used by the royal air force throughout the conflict in malaya britain conducted 4,500 airstrikes in the first five years of the malayan war buzzing likely enemy positions was used ( the modern 'show of force ' ) , and the bombing of potential escape routes was also occasionally practised '' the attack was entirely successful '' , jackson declares , since '' four terrorists were killed '' like the usa later did in vietnam , british troops sometimes set fire to villages whose inhabitants were accused of supporting the insurgents , detaining thousands of suspected collaborators , and to deny the insurgents cover insurgents had numerous advantages over british forces ; they lived in closer proximity to villagers , they sometimes had relatives or close friends in the village , and they were not afraid to threaten violence or torture and murder village leaders as an example to the others , forcing them to assist them with food and information british forces thus faced a dual-threat : the insurgents and the silent network in villages who supported them the indonesia–malaysia confrontation of 1963–66 arose from tensions between indonesia and the new british backed malaysia that was conceived in the aftermath of the malayan emergency communist insurgency
