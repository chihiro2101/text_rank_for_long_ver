the autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system the nts also receives input from a nearby chemosensory center , the area postrema , that detects toxins in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid and is essential for chemically induced vomiting or conditional taste aversion ( the memory that ensures that an animal that has been poisoned by a food never touches it again ) autonomic nerves travel to organs throughout the body pain in any internal organ is perceived as referred pain , more specifically as pain from the dermatome corresponding to the spinal segment another example is the constant , second-to-second , modulation of heart rate by sympathetic and parasympathetic influences , as a function of the respiratory cycles higher organisms maintain their integrity via homeostasis which relies on negative feedback regulation which , in turn , typically depends on the autonomic nervous system some typical actions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are listed below promotes a fight-or-flight response , corresponds with arousal and energy generation , and inhibits digestion diverts blood flow away from the gastro-intestinal ( gi ) tract and skin via vasoconstriction blood flow to skeletal muscles and the lungs is enhanced ( by as much as 1200 % in the case of skeletal muscles ) dilates bronchioles of the lung through circulating epinephrine , which allows for greater alveolar oxygen exchange increases heart rate and the contractility of cardiac cells ( myocytes ) , thereby providing a mechanism for enhanced blood flow to skeletal muscles dilates pupils and relaxes the ciliary muscle to the lens , allowing more light to enter the eye and enhances far vision provides vasodilation for the coronary vessels of the heart constricts all the intestinal sphincters and the urinary sphincter inhibits peristalsis stimulates orgasm functions of nerves within the parasympathetic nervous system include : dilating blood vessels leading to the gi tract , increasing the blood flow constricting the bronchiolar diameter when the need for oxygen has diminished dedicated cardiac branches of the vagus and thoracic accessory nerve nerves impart parasympathetic control of the heart ( myocardium ) constriction of the pupil and contraction of the ciliary muscles , facilitating accommodation and allowing for closer vision stimulating salivary gland secretion , and accelerates peristalsis , mediating digestion of food and , indirectly , the absorption of nutrients sexual short-term physiological effects of caffeine include increased blood pressure and sympathetic nerve outflow this tendency is likely due to caffeine 's ability to increase sympathetic nerve outflow the caffeine-stimulated increase in nerve activity is likely to evoke other physiological effects as the body attempts to maintain homeostasis the effects of caffeine on parasympathetic activity may vary depending on the position of the individual when autonomic responses are measured one study found that the seated position inhibited autonomic activity after caffeine consumption ( 75 & nbsp ; mg ) ; however , parasympathetic activity increased in the supine position
