the book is a visual essay about sex roles in advertising and the differences , as well as the symbolism implied in the depictions of men and women in advertising as many consumers and professionals think , sex is used to grab a viewer 's attention but this is a short-term success whether using sex in advertising is effective depends on the product the use of physically attractive models in advertising is a form of sex in advertising this form of sex in advertising is effective as it draws attention and influences the overall feeling of the ad marketers often use tactics such as using sexual imagery in their advertisements to capture the consumer 's attention for longer sexual behaviour can also be displayed using several models interacting in a more or less sexual way this advertisement , directed at women , puts an emphasis on the sense of touch by using words such as '' moist '' , and on the whole the ad creates a subconscious association between the product and sexual pleasure the ads offered women a visual vocabulary to imagine their new social and political roles as citizens and to play an active role in shaping their identity as modern women the soap 's sales decline was reversed , however , with ads containing images of romantic couples and promises of love and intimacy for those using the brand '' this research has led to the popular idea that '' sex sells '' a & f have expressed that they will move away from sexual marketing , and focus on showcasing product and trends however , the introduction of attraction and especially sexuality into an ad often distracts from the original message and can cause an adverse effect of the consumer wanting to take action a 2005 research by mediaanalyzer has found that less than 10 % of men recalled the brand of sexual ads , compared to more than 19 % of non sexual ads ; a similar result was found in women ( 10.8 % vs he found that brand recall was higher for participants who saw neutral tv programs and neutral commercials versus those who saw sexual or violent commercials embedded in sexual or violent tv programs other studies have found that sex in television is extremely overrated and does not sell products in ads using sex may attract one market demographic while repelling another at the same time recent research indicates that the use of sexual images of females in ads negatively affects women 's interest a study from the university of minnesota in 2013 of how printed ads with sexual content affects women clearly showed that women are not attracted to them except in the case of products being luxurious and expensive besides alienating women there is a serious risk that the audience in general will reduce support to organisations that uses the sexual images of women without a legitimate reason further research found that men have a positive attitude to sexual adverts , whereas women have a negative response to them , this study used an advert with both a male and female in adverts sex tends to be represented in its own right and not as part of a relationship leading to the difference in responses this theory is supported by research which found that women respond less negatively to sexual adverts when it is in the context of gift giving from a man to a women this is in line with evolutionary theory that women value men for their resources and men value women for sex and fertility further research found that even in men , recall of the advert is worsened by sexual content , as they focus on breasts and legs but not on the product a 2016 study by the korea internet advertising foundation ( kiaf ) noted that 94.5 % of south korean high schoolers were familiar with sex-driven ads , 83.4 % of adults thought such ads have negative influence on society , and 91.2 % said there are too many of such ads in the 21st century , the use of increasingly explicit sexual imagery in consumer-oriented print ads have become almost commonplace ads for jeans , perfumes and many other products have featured provocative images that were designed to elicit sexual responses from as large a cross section of the population as possible , to shock by their ambivalence , or to appeal to repressed sexual desires , which are thought to carry a stronger emotional load it was hoped by using images explicitly directed towards homosexual men , their use of condoms would increase , which would help decrease rates of hiv transmission amongst gay and bisexual men the rate at which sex in advertising is being used increased from 15 % to 27 % in the advertisements that the researchers looked at their reasoning behind the increase is because they believe sex still sells , specifically with “ low-risk products impulse purchases ” the study also mentions “ alcohol , entertainment and beauty are the main product categories that use sex in advertising since the late 1970s , many researchers have determined that advertisements depict women as having less social power than men , but the ways in which females are displayed as less powerful than men have evolved over time however , as this change occurred there has been a substantial increase in the number of images that showcase women as less sexually powerful than men and as objects of men 's desire the increase in self-objectification caused by the use of sex in advertising has been found in women and men sex in advertising is an accepted marketing technique however it is not unusual for it to cause backlash when it breaks social norms body image exploitation of women in mass media feminism gender advertisement promotional model family in advertising media and gender sexual objectification shock advertising killing us softly miss representation
