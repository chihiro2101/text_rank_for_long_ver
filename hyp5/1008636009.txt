fermented foods have a long history in many cultures , with sauerkraut being one of the most well-known instances of traditional fermented moist cabbage side dishes although '' sauerkraut '' is a german word , the dish did not originate in germany , as fermenting cabbage as suan cai was already practised back in the days of the building of the great wall of china , and the practice was likely transmitted from china to europe by the tartary before frozen foods , refrigeration , and cheap transport from warmer areas became readily available in northern , central and eastern europe , sauerkraut – like other preserved foods – provided a source of nutrients during the winter see / what did they eat ? which begins '' one of cook 's most important discoveries yeasts also are present , and may yield soft sauerkraut of poor flavor when the fermentation temperature is too high the second phase starts as the acid levels become too high for many bacteria , and leuconostoc mesenteroides and other leuconostoc species take dominance the dutch sauerkraut industry found that inoculating a new batch of sauerkraut with an old batch resulted in an excessively sour product this sourdough process is known as '' backslopping '' or '' inoculum enrichment '' ; when used in making sauerkraut , first- and second-stage population dynamics , important to developing flavor , are bypassed the resulting sauerkraut salad is typically served cold , as zakuski or a side dish a home made type of very mild sauerkraut is available , where white cabbage is pickled with salt in a refrigerator for only three to seven days sometimes in russia the double fermentation is used , with the initial step producing an exceptionally sour product , which is then '' corrected '' by adding 30-50 % more fresh cabbage and fermenting the mix again the flavor additives like apples , beets , cranberries and sometimes even watermelons are usually introduced at this step sauerkraut , along with pork , is eaten traditionally in pennsylvania on new year 's day sauerkraut is also used in american cuisine as a condiment upon various foods , such as sandwiches and hot dogs many health benefits have been claimed for sauerkraut : it is a high source of vitamins c and k ; the fermentation process increases the bioavailability of nutrients rendering sauerkraut even more nutritious than the original cabbage a polish study in 2010 concluded that '' induction of the key detoxifying enzymes by cabbage juices , particularly sauerkraut , may be responsible for their chemopreventive activity demonstrated by epidemiological studies and in animal models ''
