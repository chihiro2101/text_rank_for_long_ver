for light aircraft , usually full power is used during takeoff the term rotation is used because the aircraft pivots around the axis of its main landing gear while still on the ground , usually because of gentle manipulation of the flight controls to make or facilitate this change in aircraft attitude ( once proper air displacement occurs under / over the wings , an aircraft will lift off on its own ; controls are to ease that in ) for most aircraft , attempting a takeoff without a pitch-up would require cruise speeds while still on the runway fixed-wing aircraft designed for high-speed operation ( such as commercial jet aircraft ) have difficulty generating enough lift at the low speeds encountered during takeoff for a given aircraft , the takeoff speed is usually dependent on the aircraft weight ; the heavier the weight , the greater the speed needed retrieved 12 august 2015 some aircraft are specifically designed for short takeoff and landing , which they achieve by becoming airborne at very low speeds the takeoff speed required varies with aircraft weight and aircraft configuration ( flap or slat position , as applicable ) , and is provided to the flight crew as indicated airspeed the v r for transport category aircraft is calculated such as to allow the aircraft to reach the regulatory screen height at v 2 with one engine failed in a single-engine or light twin-engine aircraft , the pilot calculates the length of runway required to take off and clear any obstacles , to ensure sufficient runway to use for takeoff most vertical take off aircraft are also able to land horizontally , but there were certain rocket-powered aircraft of the luftwaffe that only took off vertically , landing in other ways others , such as some helicopters , can only operate by vtol , due to the aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle horizontal motion
