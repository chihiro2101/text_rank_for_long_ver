further , the high costs of photomask and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built also , designers may want more information about the circuit than is available from a single mock-up cancer is an acronym for '' computer analysis of nonlinear circuits , excluding radiation '' , a hint to berkeley 's liberalism in the 1960s : life of spice at these times many circuit simulators were developed under contracts with the united states department of defense that required the capability to evaluate the radiation hardness of a circuit spice1 has relatively few circuit elements available and uses a fixed-timestep transient analysis spice2 , also coded in fortran , is a much-improved program with more circuit elements , variable timestep transient analysis using either the trapezoidal ( second order adams-moulton method ) or the gear integration method ( also known as bdf ) , equation formulation via modified nodal analysis ( avoiding the limitations of nodal analysis ) , and an innovative fortran-based memory allocation system developed by another graduate student , ellis cohen as an early public domain software program with source code available , history-of-spice on allaboutcircuits.com spice source code was from the beginning distributed by uc berkeley for a nominal charge ( to cover the cost of magnetic tape ) 871-874 , 10â€“13 may 1992 developed at georgia tech , which added mixed analog/digital '' code models '' for behavioral simulation ; cider codecs : a mixed-level circuit and device simulator , k the integrated circuit industry adopted spice quickly , and until commercial versions became well developed many ic design houses had proprietary versions of spice academic publishers , boston , 1995 today a few ic manufacturers , typically the larger companies , have groups continuing to develop spice-based circuit simulation programs analog devices offers a similar free tool called adisimpe ( based on the simetrix/simplis simertrix/simplis implementation of spice ) spice became popular because it contained the analyses and models needed to design integrated circuits of the time , and was robust enough and fast enough to be practical to use retrieved on 2007-11-10 precursors to spice often had a single purpose : the bias program , for example , did simulation of bipolar transistor circuit operating points ; the slic program did only small-signal analyses spice combined operating point solutions , transient analysis , and various small-signal analyses with the circuit elements and device models needed to successfully simulate many circuits other circuit simulators have since added many analyses beyond those in spice2 to address changing industry requirements however , a public-domain circuit simulator containing the modern analyses and features needed to become a successor in popularity to spice has not yet emerged spice3 added more sophisticated mosfet models , which were required due to advances in semiconductor technology commercial and industrial spice simulators have added many other device models as technology advanced and earlier models became inadequate to attempt standardization of these models so that a set of model parameters may be used in different simulators , an industry working group was formed , the compact model council , to choose , maintain and promote the use of standard models the building block netlist of both the photonic and electronic circuits , including their net and port connections , can be expressed in a spice format with some schematic editors , like the ones used for electronic design automation however , photonic integrated circuit simulators need to test multiple communication channels in match with different carrier frequencies , or equivalently more amplitudes in any single channel , a type of sophisticated signal that is unsupported on the program features and structure as described above spice3 also added basic x plotting , as unix and engineering workstations became common several free versions of these extended programs are available , some as introductory pspice , and some linear technology since transient analysis is dependent on time , it uses different analysis algorithms , control options with different convergence-related issues and different initialization parameters than dc analysis however , since a transient analysis first performs a dc operating point analysis ( unless the uic option is specified in the for these circuits , either the feedback loop must be broken so that a dc operating point can be calculated or the initial conditions must be provided in the simulation input
