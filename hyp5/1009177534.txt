racial boundaries can involve many factors ( such as ancestry , physical appearance , national origin , language , religion , and culture ) , and maybe set in law by governments , or may depend on local cultural norms discrimination based on skin color , ( measured for example on the fitzpatrick scale ) is closely related to racial discrimination , as skin color is often used as a proxy for race in everyday interactions , and is one factor used by legal systems that apply detailed criteria hyperdescent ) classify the same people differently , and for various reasons some people '' pass '' as a member of a different race than they would otherwise be classified in , possibly avoiding legal or interpersonal discrimination a person 's national origin ( the country in which they were born or have citizenship ) is sometimes used in determining a person 's ethnicity or race , but discrimination based on national origin can also be independent of race ( and is sometimes specifically addressed in anti-discrimination laws ) many statistical reports apply both characteristics , for example comparing non-hispanic whites to other groups when people of different races are treated differently , decisions about how to treat a particular person raise the question of which racial classification that person belongs to the common american notion that all people of geographically european ancestry and of light skin are '' white '' prevailed for finns , and other european immigrants like irish americans and italian americans whose whiteness was challenged and who faced interpersonal if not legal discrimination more than 30 years of field experimental studies have found significant levels of discrimination against non-whites in labor , housing , and product markets in 10 countries a study conducted in the netherlands and published in 2013 found significant levels of discrimination against job applicants with arabic-sounding names with regard to employment , multiple audit study have found strong evidence of racial discrimination in the united states ' labor market , with magnitudes of employers ' preferences of white applicants found in these studies ranging from 50 % to 240 % racial discrimination in the workplace falls into two basic categories : disparate treatment : an employer 's policies discriminate based upon any immutable racial characteristic , such as skin , eye or hair color , and certain facial features ; disparate impact : although an employer may not intend to discriminate based on racial characteristics , its policies nonetheless have an adverse effect based upon race the researchers view these results as strong evidence of unconscious biases rooted in discrimination in the united states ( e.g multiple experimental audit studies conducted in the united states have found that blacks and hispanics experience discrimination in about one in five and one in four housing searches , respectively a 2014 study also found evidence of racial discrimination in an american rental apartment market researchers found in contrast to white families , families of color were led to obtain housing in poor , low-quality communities due to discrimination during the home-buying process many say that the education level of people affect whether or not they admit to healthcare facilities , leaning to the argument that people of color purposefully avoid hospitals compared to white counterparts however , this is not the case although the medicaid program was passed to ensure african americans and other minorities received the healthcare treatment they deserved and to limit discrimination in hospital facilities , there still seems to be an underlying cause for the low number of black patients admitted to hospitals , like not receiving the proper dosage of medication although programs like medicaid exists to support minorities , there still seems to be a large number of people who are not insured to investigate these relationships , the researchers examined data containing reports of racial discrimination from children , which served as a significant tool to further explore these ideas subsequently , the results show a relationship between racial discrimination and negative outcomes relating to youth wellness across all three categories moreover , while examining differences among racial groups , children of asian and latino descent were found to be most at risk for mental health development , and latino children , for academic success although the studies â€™ results correlate reported racial discrimination with outcomes to well-being , this does not conclude that one or more racial groups experience greater discrimination than other racial groups for example , evidence of a weaker relationship between racial discrimination and well-being in children of african descent may be linked to parent-guided socialization practices to help children cope with racial discrimination , or possibly lack of research concerning the severity of discrimination ( 2020 ) argued that a decrease in racial discrimination can happen when white youth are aware of differences in groups and injustices due to their critical consciousness similarly , another poll conducted earlier in the year found that 41 % of us citizens believed there was '' widespread '' discrimination against whites
