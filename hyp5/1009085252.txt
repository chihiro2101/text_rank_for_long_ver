in that nineteenth-century social and historical context , the term '' conspicuous consumption '' applied narrowly in association with the men , women , and families of the upper class who applied their great wealth as a means of publicly manifesting their social power and prestige , either real or perceived in the twentieth century the significant improvement of the material standard of living of societies and the consequent growth of the middle class saw the term '' conspicuous consumption '' broadly applied to the men , women , and households who possessed the discretionary income that allowed them to practice the patterns of economic consumerism—of goods and services—which were motivated by the desire for prestige , the public display of social status , rather than by the intrinsic , practical utility of the goods and the services proper in the 1920s economists , such as paul nystrom ( 1878–1969 ) , proposed that changes in the style of life , made feasible by the economics of the industrial age , had induced in the mass of society a '' philosophy of futility '' that would increase the consumption of goods and services as a social fashion – i.e more recent economic research indicated that conspicuous consumption is in fact less common among the affluent and more common among lower-income groups , regardless of racial or ethnic background , and also common to the societies of countries with emerging markets : '' it signals that the owner came from a poor group and has something to prove as proposed by thorstein veblen in the 19th century , conspicuous consumption explains the psychological mechanics of a consumer society , and the increase in the number and the types of the goods and services that people consider necessary to and for their lives in a developed economy definitions – the term conspicuous consumption denotes the act of buying many things , especially expensive things , that are not necessary to one 's life , done in a way that makes people notice the buyer 's having bought the merchandise trigg defined conspicuous consumption as the behaviours whereby a man or a woman can display great wealth , by means of idleness—expending much time in the practice of leisure activities , and spending much money to consume luxury goods and services said that status consumption is based upon conspicuous consumption ; yet , the literature of contemporary marketing does not establish definitive meanings for the terms status consumption and conspicuous consumption mason reported that the classical , general theories of consumer decision-processes do not readily accommodate the construct of '' conspicuous consumption '' , because the nature of said socio-economic behaviours varies according to the social class and the economic group studied motivations – in the article '' status consumption in cross-national context : socio–psychological , brand and situational antecedents '' ( 2010 ) , paurav shukla said that , whilst marketing and sales researchers recognise the importance of the buyer 's social and psychological environment—the definition of the term status-directed consumption remains ambiguous , because , to develop a comprehensive general theory requires that social scientists accept two fundamental assumptions , which usually do not concord first , though the '' rational '' ( economic ) and the '' irrational '' ( psychologic ) elements of consumer decision-making often influence a person 's decision to buy particular goods and services , marketing and sales researchers usually consider the rational element dominant in a person 's decision to buy the particular goods and services high levels of conspicuous consumption may be seen as socially undesirable on two grounds ; firstly , as it is often associated with high relative income , high levels of conspicuous consumption may be an indicator of high levels of income inequality , which may be found intrinsically or instrumentally objectionable ; secondly conspicuous consumption differs from other forms of consumption in that the main reason for the purchase of positional goods is not due to the additional direct utility provided by the good 's alleged high quality , but rather the social prestige associated with the consumption of that good in this case , the externality is status anxiety , the loss of social status suffered by people whose stock of high-status goods ( positional goods ) is diminished , in relation to the stocks of other conspicuous consumers , as they increase their consumption of high-status goods and services ; effectively , status-seeking is a zero-sum game—by definition , the rise of one person in the social class can occur only at the expense of other people frank proposed the application of a progressive consumption tax ; in the article '' the big city : rich and poor , consumed by consuming '' ( 1998 ) , john tierney said that as a remedy for the social and psychological malaise that is conspicuous consumption , the personal income tax should be replaced with a progressive tax upon the yearly sum of discretionary income spent on the conspicuous consumption of goods and services when individuals are concerned with their relative income or consumption in comparison to their peers , the optimal degree of public good provision and of progression of the tax system is raised pigou said that the redistribution of wealth might lead to great gains in social welfare : the economic case for the taxation of positional , luxury goods has a long history ; in the mid-19th century , in principles of political economy with some of their applications to social philosophy ( 1848 ) , john stuart mill said : '' conspicuous nonconsumption '' is a phrase used to describe a conscious choice to opt out of consumption with the intention of sending deliberate social signals
