olaf catholic church , minneapolis , minnesota the son of åsta gudbrandsdatter and harald grenske , a petty king in vestfold , whom later icelandic sagas would describe as a great-great-grandchild of harald fairhair , norway 's first king finally , many hagiographic sources describe st watson , 'fact or folklore : the viking attack on london bridge ' , london archaeologist , 12 ( 2005 ) , pp olaf saw it as his calling to unite norway into one kingdom , as harald fairhair had largely succeeded in doing olaf returned to norway in 1015 and declared himself king , obtaining the support of the five petty kings of the uplands , norway he stayed for some time in the swedish province of nerike , where , according to local legend , he baptised many locals the exact position of saint olaf 's grave in nidaros has been unknown since 1568 , due to the effects of the lutheran iconoclasm in 1536–37 king cnut , though distracted by the task of governing england , ruled norway for five years after stiklestad , with his son svein and svein 's mother ælfgifu ( known as álfífa in old norse sources ) as regents olaf has traditionally been seen as leading the christianisation of norway , but most scholars of the period now believe that olaf had little to do with the process olaf brought with him grimkell , who is usually credited with helping olaf create episcopal sees and further organising the norwegian church also , olaf and grimkell most likely did not introduce new ecclesiastical laws to norway ; these were ascribed to olaf at a later date questions have also been raised about the nature of olaf 's christianity it seems that , like many scandinavian kings , olaf used his christianity to gain more power for the monarchy and centralise control in norway olaf himself is portrayed in later sources as a saintly miracle-working figure to help support this quick view of conversion for norway , but the historical olaf did not act this way , as seen especially in the skaldic verses attributed to him olaf swiftly became norway 's patron saint ; bishop grimkell performed his canonisation only a year after his death owing to olaf 's later status as norway 's patron saint , and to his importance in later medieval historiography and in norwegian folklore , it is difficult to assess the historical olaf 's character olaf haraldsson and olaf tryggvason are both traditionally regarded as the driving forces behind norway 's final conversion to christianity but large stone crosses and other christian symbols suggest that at least norway 's coastal areas were deeply influenced by christianity long before olaf 's time ; with one exception , all of norway 's rulers since håkon the good ( c 920–961 ) were christians , as was olaf 's main opponent , cnut the great many believe olaf introduced christian law into norway in 1024 , based upon the kuli stone the codification of christianity as the legal religion of norway was attributed to olaf , and his legal arrangements for the church of norway came to stand so high in the norwegian people 's and clergy 's eyes that when pope gregory vii attempted to make clerical celibacy binding on the priests of western europe in 1074–75 , norwegians largely ignored it , since there was no mention of clerical celibacy in olaf 's legal code for their church only after norway was made a metropolitan province with its own archbishop in 1153—making the norwegian church , on the one hand , more independent of its king , but on the other hand , more directly responsible to the pope—did canon law gain a greater prominence in the life and jurisdiction of the norwegian church for various reasons , most importantly the death of king cnut the great in 1035 but perhaps also a certain discontent among norwegian nobles with danish rule in the years after olaf 's death in 1030 , olaf 's illegitimate son with the concubine alvhild , magnus the good , assumed power in norway , and eventually also in denmark numerous danish churches were dedicated to olaf during his reign , and the sagas give glimpses of the young king 's efforts to promote the cult of his deceased father in christian times this legitimation of a dynasty 's right to rule and its national prestige was based on its descent from a saintly king thus the kings of norway promoted the cult of st sigrid undset noted that olaf was baptised in rouen , the capital of normandy , and suggested that olaf may have used priests of norman descent for his missionaries among the bishops olaf is known to have brought with him from england was grimkell he was probably the only one of the missionary bishops left in the country at the time of olaf 's death , and he stood behind the translation and beatification of olaf on 3 august 1031 grimkell later became the first bishop of sigtuna in sweden but olaf ii died before the east-west schism and a strict roman rite was not well-established in scandinavia at the time this is probably why the earliest traces of a liturgical cult of olaf are found in england writing around 1070 , adam of bremen mentions pilgrimage to st by this time he was also being called norway 's eternal king olaf during most of the middle ages were probably compiled or written by eystein erlendsson , the second archbishop of nidaros ( 1161–1189 ) his presence was even felt in finland and many travelled from all over the norse world in order to visit his shrine several churches in england were dedicated to him ( often as st olave ) ; the name was presumably popular with scandinavian immigrants this is generally accepted to be the earliest datable church foundation dedicated to olaf and is further evidence of a cult of st olaf was also , together with the virgin mary , the patron saint of the chapel of the varangians , the scandinavian warriors who served as the bodyguard of the byzantine emperor olaf was also the last saint venerated by both the western and eastern churches before the great schism its altarpiece contains a painting of the saint , shown as a martyr king defeating a dragon , representing victory over his pagan past in germany , there used to be a shrine of st popular tradition also made marks in the ecclesiastical material
