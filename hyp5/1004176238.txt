the national institute on drug abuse defines medical cannabis as '' using the whole , unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat symptoms of illness and other conditions '' in comparison , typical government-approved medications contain only one or two chemicals the number of active chemicals in cannabis is one reason why treatment with cannabis is difficult to classify and study overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear whether it is a useful treatment for any condition , or whether harms outweight any benefit it is unclear whether american states might be able to mitigate the adverse effects of the opioid epidemic by prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative pain management drug medical cannabis is somewhat effective in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( cinv ) and may be a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment when cannabis is inhaled to relieve pain , blood levels of cannabinoids rise faster than when oral products are used , peaking within three minutes and attaining an analgesic effect in seven minutes evidence also suggests that oral cannabis extract is effective for reducing patient-centered measures of spasticity in the united states , cannabidiol , one of the cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant , has been approved for treating two severe forms of epilepsy , lennox-gastaut syndrome and dravet syndrome there is no good evidence that medical cannabis is effective for treating posttraumatic stress disorder , and its use for this purpose is not recommended the amount of cannabis normally used for medicinal purposes is not believed to cause any permanent cognitive impairment in adults , though long-term treatment in adolescents should be weighed carefully as they are more susceptible to these impairments withdrawal symptoms are rarely a problem with controlled medical administration of cannabinoids these statistics include visits in which the patient was treated for a condition induced by or related to recent cannabis use compared to non-smokers , people who smoked cannabis regularly in adolescence exhibit reduced connectivity in specific brain regions associated with memory , learning , alertness , and executive function one study suggested that sustained heavy , daily , adolescent onset cannabis use over decades is associated with a decline in iq by age 38 , with no effects found in those who initiated cannabis use later , or in those who ceased use earlier in adulthood a follow-up review found that iq deficit may be a precursor , rather than result , of cannabis use , and that social and environmental factors are a likely influence there has been a limited amount of studies that have looked at the effects of smoking cannabis on the respiratory system regular cannabis use has not been shown to cause significant abnormalities in lung function light and moderate use of cannabis is not believed to increase risk of lung or upper airway cancer there is serious suspicion among cardiologists , spurring research but falling short of definitive proof , that cannabis use has the potential to contribute to cardiovascular disease research in these events is complicated because cannabis is often used in conjunction with tobacco , and drugs such as alcohol and cocaine these putative effects can be taken in context of a wide range of cardiovascular phenomena regulated by the endocannabinoid system and an overall role of cannabis in causing decreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output , which potentially could pose a threat to those with cardiovascular disease cannabis usually causes no tolerance or withdrawal symptoms except in heavy users the discrepancies between studies may reflect greater long-term effects among heavier users relative to occasional users , and greater duration of effect among those with heavy use as adolescents compared to later in life a second systematic review focused on neuroimaging studies found little evidence supporting an effect of cannabis use on brain structure and function a 2007 meta analysis concluded that cannabis use reduced the average age of onset of psychosis by 2.7 years relative to non-cannabis use a 2004 literature review on the subject concluded that cannabis use is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of psychosis , but that cannabis use is '' neither necessary nor sufficient '' to cause psychosis a french review from 2009 came to a conclusion that cannabis use , particularly that before age 15 , was a factor in the development of schizophrenic disorders smoking and inhalation of vaporized cannabis have better absorption than do other routes of administration , and therefore also have more predictable distribution smoking has been the means of administration of cannabis for many users , but it is not suitable for the use of cannabis as a medicine it was the most common method of medical cannabis consumption in the us it is difficult to predict the pharmacological response to cannabis because concentration of cannabinoids varies widely , as there are different ways of preparing it for consumption ( smoked , applied as oils , eaten , infused into other foods , or drunk ) and a lack of production controls the potential for adverse effects from smoke inhalation makes smoking a less viable option than oral preparations the us food and drug administration ( fda ) has not approved smoked cannabis for any condition or disease , as it deems that evidence is lacking concerning safety and efficacy the fda issued a 2006 advisory against smoked medical cannabis stating : '' marijuana has a high potential for abuse , has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states , and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision o'shaughnessy discovered cannabis in the 1830s while living abroad in india , where he conducted numerous experiments investigating the drug 's medical utility ( noting in particular its analgesic and anticonvulsant effects ) the use of cannabis in medicine began to decline by the end of the 19th century , due to difficulty in controlling dosages and the rise in popularity of synthetic and opium-derived drugs cannabis began to attract renewed interest as medicine in the 1970s and 1980s , in particular due to its use by cancer and aids patients who reported relief from the effects of chemotherapy and cachexia in mexico , thc content of medical cannabis is limited to one percent cannabis is classified as a schedule i drug under the single convention treaty , meaning that medical use is allowed but that it is considered to be an addictive drug with a serious risk of abuse – along with other drugs such as opium and cocaine cannabis remains illegal at the federal level under the controlled substances act , which classifies it as a schedule i drug with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use before this can happen , the fda must first permit the study of the medical benefits and drawbacks of the substance , which it has not done since it was placed on schedule i of the controlled substances act in 1970 the american heart association says that '' many of the concerning health implications of cannabis include cardiovascular diseases '' but that it supports rescheduling to allow '' more nuanced cancer research uk say that while cannabis is being studied for therapeutic potential , '' claims that there is solid 'proof ' that cannabis or cannabinoids can cure cancer is highly misleading to patients and their families , and builds a false picture of the state of progress in this area '' the authors of a report on a 2011 survey of medical cannabis users say that critics have suggested that some users '' game the system '' to obtain medical cannabis ostensibly for treatment of a condition , but then use it for nonmedical purposes – though the truth of this claim is hard to measure for reasons including increased popular support of cannabis use , a trend of cannabis legalization , and the perception of medical usefulness , more scientists are doing medical cannabis research medical cannabis is unusually broad as a treatment for many conditions , each of which has its own state of research similarly , various countries conduct and respond to medical cannabis research in different ways .
