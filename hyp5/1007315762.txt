according to the big bang theory , the very early universe was an extremely hot and dense state about age of the universe which rapidly expanded matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars , galaxy and other astronomical objects , leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space the present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe these observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is '' flat '' , meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe , except for local gravity the flat universe , combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating hubble 's law , indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy , which is called dark energy the density of the universe is clearly not uniform ; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies , such as planets , stars , and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density , at least in terms of visible matter unlike matter and dark matter , dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies : although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the universe , dark energy 's influence is 5 order of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the milky way it has effectively no friction , allowing stars , planets , and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits , following the initial formation stage the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered : the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 10 23 & nbsp ; km , or 10 & nbsp ; billion light years above this altitude , isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas , as it is on earth the gas temperatures in outer space can vary widely magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object the panspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world a conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the solar system , with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between venus , earth , and mars even at relatively low altitudes in the earth 's atmosphere , conditions are hostile to the human body the altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the vapor pressure of water at the human body temperature is called the armstrong line , named after american physician harry g most space suits use around 30–39 & nbsp ; kpa of pure oxygen , about the same as on the earth 's surface on a round-trip mars mission lasting three years , a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut 's body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei the energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers.the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew space is a partial vacuum : its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and '' winds '' that dominate within them , and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond geospace extends from earth 's atmosphere to the outer reaches of earth 's magnetic field , whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts , even in low earth orbit although it meets the definition of outer space , the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites the region outside earth 's atmosphere and extending out to just beyond the moon 's orbit , including the lagrange points , is sometimes referred to as cislunar space the itu-r ( including satellites ) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind , a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere ( the heliosphere ) for billions of kilometers into space interplanetary space extends out to the astropause where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the sun the volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum , with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the earth interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma the density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably : the average is around 10 6 particles per m 3 , but cold molecular clouds can hold 10 8 –10 12 per m 3 the local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100 & nbsp ; parsecs ( pc ) of the sun , which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the solar system this volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the local bubble , which is characterized by a lack of dense , cold clouds instead , these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the universe has a foam-like structure , with galaxy groups and clusters lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space ) computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the universe might exist in this warm–hot , rarefied state the energy required to reach earth orbital velocity at an altitude of is about 36 & nbsp ; mj/kg , which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude the rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite 's cross-sectional area and mass , as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere the escape velocity required to pull free of earth 's gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about there is no clear boundary between earth 's atmosphere and space , as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases nasa 's space shuttle used 400,000 feet , as its re-entry altitude ( termed the entry interface ) , which roughly marks the boundary where atmospheric drag becomes noticeable , thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces in 2009 , scientists reported detailed measurements with a supra-thermal ion imager ( an instrument that measures the direction and speed of ions ) , which allowed them to establish a boundary at above earth the boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the earth 's atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space , which can reach speeds well over he correctly noted that the atmosphere of the earth surrounds the planet like a shell , with the density gradually declining with altitude in 1887 , the michelson–morley experiment tried to detect the earth 's motion through this medium by looking for changes in the speed of light depending on the direction of the planet 's motion this corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years this theory holds that the universe originated from a very dense form that has since undergone continuous expansion using the estimated radiation of the background stars , he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6 & nbsp ; k before reliable rocket technology , the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through balloon flights they remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space , as well as for observation of the earth in august 2012 , voyager 1 became the first man-made object to leave the solar system and enter interstellar space the absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum likewise , a site like the daedalus crater on the far side of the moon could shield a radio telescope from the electromagnetic interference that hampers earth-based observations the deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes , such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces interstellar travel for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility for example , the project daedalus study , which proposed a spacecraft powered by the fusion of deuterium and helium-3 , would require 36 years to reach the '' nearby '' alpha centauri system
