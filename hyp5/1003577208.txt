typical requirements which are considered in the design process are : the filter should have a specific frequency response the filter should have a specific phase shift or group delay the filter should have a specific impulse response the filter should be causal the filter should be stable the filter should be localized ( pulse or step inputs should result in finite time outputs ) the computational complexity of the filter should be low the filter should be implemented in particular hardware or software in relation to the desired frequency function , there may also be an accompanying weighting function , which describes , for each frequency , how important it is that the resulting frequency function approximates the desired one however , in certain applications it may be the filter 's impulse response that is explicit and the design process then aims at producing as close an approximation as possible to the requested impulse response given all other requirements for example , we may want both a specific frequency function of the filter and that the resulting filter have a small effective width in the signal domain as possible in order to be implementable , any time-dependent filter ( operating in real time ) must be causal : the filter response only depends on the current and past inputs on the other hand , filters based on feedback circuits have other advantages and may therefore be preferred , even if this class of filters includes unstable filters a consequence of applying a filter to a signal is , in intuitive terms , that the duration of the local phenomena is extended by the width of the filter this implies that it is sometimes important to keep the width of the filter 's impulse response function as short as possible according to the uncertainty relation of the fourier transform , the product of the width of the filter 's impulse response function and the width of its frequency function must exceed a certain constant consequently , it may not be possible to simultaneously meet requirements on the locality of the filter 's impulse response function as well as on its frequency function this means that by choosing a low order filter , the computation time can be reduced if the filter has many coefficients , for example in the case of multidimensional signals such as tomography data , it may be relevant to reduce the number of coefficients by removing those which are sufficiently close to zero in this case , a significant reduction in computational complexity can be obtained if the filter can be separated as the convolution of one 1d filter in the horizontal direction and one 1d filter in the vertical direction digital filters are classified into one of two basic forms , according to how they respond to a unit impulse : finite impulse response , or fir , filters express each output sample as a weighted sum of the last n input samples , where n is the order of the filter if the fir coefficients are symmetrical ( often the case ) , then such a filter is linear phase , so it delays signals of all frequencies equally which is important in many applications such a filter contains internal state , and the output and the next internal state are determined by a linear combination of the previous inputs and outputs ( in other words , they use feedback , which fir filters normally do not ) additionally , since the phase shift is inherently a non-linear function of frequency , the time delay through such a filter is frequency-dependent , which can be a problem in many situations often , this is done by adding analog anti-aliasing filters at the input and output , thus avoiding any frequency component above the nyquist frequency the previous method can be extended to include an additional error term related to a desired filter impulse response in the signal domain , with a corresponding weighting function the ideal impulse response can be chosen independently of the ideal frequency function and is in practice used to limit the effective width and to remove ringing effects of the resulting filter in the signal domain the optimal filter can still be calculated by solving a simple least squares problem and the resulting filter is then a '' compromise '' which has a total optimal fit to the ideal functions in both domains
