when barthes was eleven , his family moved to paris , though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life his life from 1939 to 1948 was largely spent obtaining a licence in grammar and philology , publishing his first papers , taking part in a medical study , and continuing to struggle with his health during this time , he contributed to the leftist parisian paper combat , out of which grew his first full-length work , writing degree zero ( 1953 ) ( michelet and writing degree zero had already been published in france , but he was not yet known in america—not even in most french departments many of his works challenged traditional academic views of literary criticism and of renowned figures of literature his unorthodox thinking led to a conflict with a well-known sorbonne professor of literature , raymond picard , who attacked the french new criticism ( a label that he inaccurately applied to barthes ) for its obscurity and lack of respect towards france 's literary roots during this time , he wrote his best-known work , the 1967 essay '' death of the author , '' which , in light of the growing influence of jacques derrida 's deconstruction , would prove to be a transitional piece in its investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought throughout the 1970s , barthes continued to develop his literary criticism ; he developed new ideals of textualism and novelistic neutrality his last major work , camera lucida , is partly an essay about the nature of photography and partly a meditation on photographs of his mother barthes 's response was to try to discover that which may be considered unique and original in writing in writing degree zero ( 1953 ) , barthes argues that conventions inform both language and style , rendering neither purely creative however , a writer 's form is vulnerable to becoming a convention once it has been made available to the public in studying his writings , he continued , one should not seek to learn from michelet 's claims ; rather , one should maintain a critical distance and learn from his errors , since understanding how and why his thinking is flawed will show more about his period of history than his own observations in this sense , barthes believed that art should be critical and should interrogate the world , rather than seek to explain it , as michelet had done the former pertains to the literal or explicit meaning of things while the latter is composed of the language used to speak about the first order barthes used the term '' myth '' while analyzing the popular , consumer culture of post-war france in order to reveal that '' objects were organized into meaningful relationships via narratives that expressed collective cultural values in this work he explained how in the fashion world any word could be loaded with idealistic bourgeois emphasis in the end barthes 's mythologies became absorbed into bourgeois culture , as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon , being interested in his control over his readership as barthes 's work with structuralism began to flourish around the time of his debates with picard , his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing , which he felt was overlooked by old criticism by breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality this is to say that without some regular standard of measurement , a system of criticism that references nothing outside of the actual work itself could never prove useful in the wake of this trip barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work , the essay '' the death of the author '' ( 1968 ) barthes saw the notion of the author , or authorial authority , in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature , but others see it as more of a transitional phase for barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the bourgeois norms since barthes contends that there can be no originating anchor of meaning in the possible intentions of the author , he considers what other sources of meaning or significance can be found in literature he concludes that since meaning ca n't come from the author , it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis from this project barthes concludes that an ideal text is one that is reversible , or open to the greatest variety of independent interpretations and not restrictive in meaning in the late 1970s , barthes was increasingly concerned with the conflict of two types of language : that of popular culture , which he saw as limiting and pigeonholing in its titles and descriptions , and neutral , which he saw as open and noncommittal as a reaction to this , he wrote the pleasure of the text ( 1975 ) , a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking : hedonism the theory he developed out of this focus claimed that , while reading for pleasure is a kind of social act , through which the reader exposes him/herself to the ideas of the writer , the final catharsis climax of this pleasurable reading , which he termed the bliss in reading or jouissance , is a point in which one becomes lost within the text this loss of self within the text or immersion in the text , signifies a final impact of reading that is experienced outside the social realm and free from the influence of culturally associative language and is thus neutral with regard to social progress despite this newest theory of reading , barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing , which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object he became interested in finding the best method for creating neutral writing , and he decided to try to create a novelistic form of rhetoric that would not seek to impose its meaning on the reader yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one , and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader the end result is one that challenges the reader 's views of social constructs of love , without trying to assert any definitive theory of meaning the theory , which is also described as ethico-political entity , considers the idea of the body as one that functions as a '' fashion word '' that provides the illusion of a grounded discourse many of his monthly myth articles in the 50s had attempted to show how a photographic image could represent implied meanings and thus be used by bourgeois culture to infer 'naturalistic truths ' barthes found the solution to this fine line of personal meaning in the form of his mother 's picture as one of his final works before his death , camera lucida was both an ongoing reflection on the complicated relations between subjectivity , meaning and cultural society as well as a touching dedication to his mother and description of the depth of his grief 110 it contains fragments from his journals : his soirées de paris ( a 1979 extract from his erotic diary of life in paris ) ; an earlier diary he kept which explicitly detailed his paying for sex with men and boys in morocco ; and light of the sud ouest ( his childhood memories of rural french life ) in november 2007 , yale university press published a new translation into english ( by richard howard ) of barthes 's little known work what is sport while his influence is mainly found in these theoretical fields with which his work brought him into contact , it is also felt in every field concerned with the representation of information and models of communication , including computers , photography , music , and literature one consequence of barthes 's breadth of focus is that his legacy includes no following of thinkers dedicated to modeling themselves after him the fact that barthes 's work was ever adapting and refuting notions of stability and constancy means there is no canon of thought within his theory to model one 's thoughts upon , and thus no '' barthesism '' readerly and writerly are terms barthes employs both to delineate one type of literature from another and to implicitly interrogate ways of reading , like positive or negative habits the modern reader brings into one 's experience with the text itself a culture and its texts , barthes writes , should never be accepted in their given forms and traditions '' the author '' is our traditional concept of the lone genius creating a work of literature or other piece of writing by the powers of his/her original imagination in place of the author , the modern world presents us with a figure barthes calls the '' scriptor , '' whose only power is to combine pre-existing texts in new ways barthes believes that all writing draws on previous texts , norms , and conventions , and that these are the things to which we must turn to understand a text as a way of asserting the relative unimportance of the writer 's biography compared to these textual and generic conventions , barthes says that the scriptor has no past , but is born with the text he also argues that , in the absence of the idea of an '' author-god '' to control the meaning of a work , interpretive horizons are opened up considerably for the active reader '' the sinologist simon leys , in a review of barthes 's diary of a trip to china during the cultural revolution , disparages barthes for his seeming indifference to the situation of the chinese people , and says that barthes '' has contrived—amazingly—to bestow an entirely new dignity upon the age-old activity , so long unjustly disparaged , of saying nothing at great length '' laurent binet 's novel the 7th function of language is based on the premise that barthes was not merely accidentally hit by a van but that he was instead murdered , as part of a conspiracy to acquire a document known as the '' seventh function of language '' critical essays ( 1972 ) , northwestern university press a barthes reader ( 1982 ) , hill and wang : new york the responsibility of forms : critical essays on music , art , and
