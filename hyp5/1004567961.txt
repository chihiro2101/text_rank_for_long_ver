against the vc and the role of the arvn became less and less significant although the american news media has often portrayed the vietnam war as a primarily american and north vietnamese conflict , the arvn carried the brunt of the fight before and after large-scale american involvement , and participated in many major operations with american troops arvn troops pioneered the use of the m113 armored personnel carrier as an infantry fighting vehicle by fighting mounted rather than as a '' battle taxi '' as originally designed , and the armored cavalry ( acav ) modifications were adopted based on arvn experience one notable arvn unit equipped with m113s , the 3d armored cavalry squadron , used the new tactic so proficiently and with such extraordinary heroism against hostile forces

out american forces and rendering the arvn capable of fighting an effective war against the people 's army of vietnam ( pavn ) and vc slowly , the arvn began to expand from its counter-insurgency role to become the primary ground defense against the pavn/vc starting in 1968 , south vietnam began calling up every available man for service in the arvn , reaching a strength of one million soldiers by 1972 in 1970 they performed well in the cambodian incursion and were executing three times as many operations as they had during the american-led war period however , the arvn equipment continued to be of lower standards than their american and other allies , even as the u.s still , sir robert thompson , a british military officer widely regarded as the worlds foremost expert in counterinsurgency warfare during the vietnam war , thought that by 1972 , the arvn had developed into one of the best fighting forces in the world , comparing them favorably with the israeli defence forces forced to carry the burden left by the americans , the arvn actually started to perform rather well , though with continued american air support the assault combined infantry wave assaults , artillery and the
