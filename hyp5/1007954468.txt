the word galleon , '' large ship '' , comes from spanish ( castilian ) galeón , '' armed merchant ship '' , from old french galion , '' little ship '' ( 13c in the early 16th century , the venetian galleoni was a new class of galley used to hunt down pirates in the mediterranean later , when the term started to be applied to sail-only vessels , it meant , like the english term '' man-of-war '' , any large warship that was otherwise no different from the other sailing ships of the time with the introduction of the galleon in portuguese india armadas during the first quarter of the 16th century , os navios e as técnicas náuticas atlânticas nos séculos xv e xvi : os pilares da estratégia 3c – rear admiral antonio silva ribeiro – revista militar galeão – navegações portuguesas by francisco contente domingues carracks ' armament was reduced as they became almost exclusively cargo ships ( which is why the portuguese carracks were pushed to such large sizes ) , leaving any fighting to be done to the galleons carracks also tended to be lightly armed and used for transporting cargo in all the fleets of other western european states , while galleons were purpose-built warships , and were stronger , more heavily armed , and also cheaper to build ( five galleons could cost around the same as three carracks ) and were therefore a much better investment for use as warships or transports '' the galleon evolved in response to spain 's need for an ocean-crossing cargo ship that could beat off corsairs they were used in both military and trade applications , most famously in the spanish treasure fleet , and the manila galleons the galleon was the prototype of all square-rigged ships with three or more masts for over two and a half centuries , including the later full-rigged ship the principal warships of the opposing england and spain fleets in the 1588 confrontation of the spanish armada were galleons , with the modified english race-built galleons developed by john hawkins proving decisive , while the capacious spanish galleons , designed primarily as transports , showed great endurance in the battles and in the great storms on the voyage home ; most survived the ordeal therefore , most galleons were originally consigned for trade , although those captured by rival states were usually put into military service because of the long periods often spent at sea and poor conditions on board , many of the crew often perished during the voyage ; therefore advanced rigging systems were developed so that the vessel could be sailed home by an active sailing crew a fraction of the size aboard at departure the galleons solidified the place of the square-rig and the centrally situated tallest main-masts and the slightly shorter fore-masts of a square-rigged ship characteristic of the 16th–19th centuries , but introduced the use of the lateen rig to sail closer to the wind on a tack than could a square-rigged vessel—an important attribute in restricted waters , but more so over long voyages where holding a few compass points closer to the wind might save hundreds of miles and days or weeks of sailing 'beating into the wind ' the galleon continued to be used into the 18th century , by which time purpose-built vessels such as the fluyt , the brig and the full-rigged ship , both as a trading vessel and ship of the line , rendered it obsolete for trade and warfare respectively the vessel was so large it could not enter st he was captured by the spanish in the action of atacames bay in 1594 and served in the spanish navy in the south american pacific for several years revenge , a galleon built in 1577 , the flagship of sir francis drake in the battle of the spanish armada in 1588 , was captured by a spanish fleet off flores in the azores in 1591 and sank while being sailed back to spain
