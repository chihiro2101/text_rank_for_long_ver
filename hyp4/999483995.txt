with the onset of the great depression in the united kingdom , the government became more parsimonious with funding for science at the same time , lawrence 's recent invention , the cyclotron , promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics , and chadwick felt that the cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one he therefore chafed under rutherford , who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large , expensive equipment , and turned down the request for a cyclotron chadwick was himself a critic of big science in general , and lawrence in particular , whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science the laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on direct current electricity , but chadwick seized the opportunity , assuming the chair on 1 october 1935 determined not to spend another war in an internment camp , chadwick made his way to stockholm as fast as he could , but when he arrived there with his family , he found that all air traffic between stockholm and london had been suspended in october 1939 , chadwick received a letter from sir edward appleton , the secretary of the department of scientific and industrial research , asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atomic bomb pegram and harold urey visited britain to see how the project , now known as tube alloys , was going , chadwick was able to tell them : '' i wish i could tell you that the bomb is not going to work , but i am 90 per cent sure that it will '' in a recent book about the bomb project , graham farmelo wrote that '' chadwick did more than any other scientist to give churchill the bomb sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us sir hermann bondi suggested that it was fortunate that chadwick , not rutherford , was the doyen of uk physics at the time , as the latter 's prestige might otherwise have overpowered chadwick 's interest in '' looking forward '' to the bomb 's prospects at the same time that the british became convinced that a joint project was necessary , the progress of the american manhattan project was such that british cooperation seemed less essential , although the americans were still eager to utilise chadwick 's talents leaving rotblat in charge in liverpool , chadwick began a tour of the manhattan project facilities in november 1943 , except for the hanford site where plutonium was produced , which he was not allowed to see he became the only man apart from groves and his second in command to have access to all the american research and production facilities for the uranium bomb for security reasons , he was given the cover name of james chaffee chadwick accepted that the americans did not need british help , but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion he also endeavoured to place british scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war british nuclear weapons project to which chadwick was committed requests from groves via chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company , ministry or university currently employing them , only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to tube alloys as a result , the british team was critical to the project 's success although he had more knowledge of the project than anyone else from britain , chadwick had no access to the hanford site knight bachelor he considered this to be a recognition of the work of the whole tube alloys project he was present at the meeting of the combined policy committee on 4 july when field marshal sir henry maitland wilson gave britain 's agreement to use the atomic bomb against japan , and at the trinity nuclear test on 16 july , when the first atomic bomb was detonated laurence , the new york times reporter attached to the manhattan project , wrote that '' never before in history had any man lived to see his own discovery materialize itself with such telling effect on the destiny of man
