during the world war i , the then-lieutenant langsdorff received the iron cross 2nd class at the battle of jutland in 1916 , and subsequently worked on minesweepers for the rest of the war he received the iron cross 1st class sometime during the remainder of the war , but the exact date is unknown following the rise to power of the nazis , langsdorff requested duty at sea in 1934 , but was instead appointed to the interior ministry on 21 august 1939 , admiral graf spee left port with orders to raid enemy commercial shipping in the south atlantic following the outbreak of the second world war for the first three weeks of the war , the ship hid in the open ocean east of brazil while the german government determined how serious britain was about the war the uruguayan authorities followed international treaties and , although granting an extra 72 hours stay over the normal 24 hours , required that admiral graf spee leave port by 20:00 on 17 december 1939 or else be interned for the duration of the war langsdorff sought orders from berlin , and was given instructions that the ship was not to be interned in uruguay ( which was sympathetic to britain ) , or to be allowed to fall into enemy hands , but he was given no directive as to what action to take he therefore considered that he could try to take the ship to the argentina during world war ii although it was thought that the channel was not sufficiently deep for the ship ; he could take the ship out to sea to battle the british forces again ( british propaganda was trying to persuade people that a large british force already lay in wait for himâ€”though in fact it would not be able to arrive for five days ) ; or he could scuttle the ship he wrote on 19 december 1939 : i can now only prove by my death that the fighting services of the third reich are ready to die for the honour of the flag ajax is named after the royal navy cruiser involved in the battle of the river plate and many of its streets are named after people involved in the action
