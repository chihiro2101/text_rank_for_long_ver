; bacterial recombination in bacteria there are : regular bacterial recombination , as well as noneffective transfer of genetic material , expressed as unsuccessful transfer or abortive transfer which is any bacterium dna transfer of the donor cell recipients who have set the incoming dna as part of the genetic material of the recipient the shuffling of genes brought about by genetic recombination produces increased genetic variation it is the frequency of crossing over between two linked gene loci ( markers ) , and depends on the mutual distance of the genetic loci observed for any fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions , recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure ( chromosome ) tends to be constant , and the same is then true for the crossing-over value which is used in the production of genetic maps in gene conversion , a section of genetic material is copied from one chromosome to another , without the donating chromosome being changed b cells of the immune system perform genetic recombination , called immunoglobulin class switching in genetic engineering , recombination can also refer to artificial and deliberate recombination of disparate pieces of dna , often from different organisms , creating what is called recombinant dna a prime example of such a use of genetic recombination is gene targeting , which can be used to add , delete or otherwise change an organism 's genes in bacteria , transformation is a process of gene transfer that ordinarily occurs between individual cells of the same bacterial species when two or more viruses , each containing lethal genomic damages , infect the same host cell , the virus genomes can often pair with each other and undergo hrr to produce viable progeny in the case of pathogenic viruses , multiplicity reactivation may be an adaptive benefit to the virus since it allows the repair of dna damages caused by exposure to the oxidizing environment produced during host infection however , other types of dna damage may also initiate recombination pmid : 17166055 ; pmcid : pmc1657055 the nco/sdsa pathway contributes little to genetic variation , since the arms of the chromosomes flanking the recombination event remain in the parental configuration numerous rna viruses are capable of genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same host cell rna recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genome architecture and the course of viral evolution among picornavirus ( ( + ) ssrna ) ( e.g hiv ) , damage in the rna genome appears to be avoided during reverse transcriptase by strand switching , a form of recombination switching between template strands during genome replication , referred to as copy-choice recombination , was originally proposed to explain the positive correlation of recombination events over short distances in organisms with a dna genome ( see first figure , sdsa pathway ) thus , the forced copy-choice model implies that recombination is required for virus integrity and survival , as it is able to correct for genomic damage in order to create proviral dna another recombination model counters this idea , and instead proposes that recombination occurs sporadically when the two domains of reverse transcriptase , the rnase h and the polymerase , differ in their activity speeds recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genetic variability within coronaviruses , as well as the ability of coronavirus species to jump from one host to another and , infrequently , for the emergence of novel species , although the mechanism of recombination in is unclear
