( this supports the belief that great zimbabwe 's decline was due to a shortage of resources ) the first european visit may have been made by the portuguese traveler antónio fernandes in 1513-1515 , who crossed twice and reported in detail the region of present-day zimbabwe ( including the shona kingdoms ) and also fortified centers in stone without mortar 738 portuguese traders heard about the remains of the ancient city in the early 16th century , and records survive of interviews and notes made by some of them , linking great zimbabwe to gold production and long-distance trade two of those accounts mention an inscription above the entrance to great zimbabwe , written in characters not known to the arab merchants who had seen it as to the actual identity of the builders of great zimbabwe , de barros writes : additionally , with regard to the purpose of the great zimbabwe ruins , de barros asserted that : '' in the opinion of the moors who saw it great zimbabwe it is very ancient and was built to keep possessions of the mines , which are very old , and no gold has been extracted from them for years , because of the wars it would seem that some prince who has possession of these mines ordered it to be built as a sign thereof , which he afterwards lost in the course of time and through their being so remote from his kingdom '' thus , great zimbabwe appears to have still been inhabited as recently as the early 16th century bent stated in the first edition of his book the ruined cities of mashonaland ( 1892 ) that the ruins revealed either the phoenicians or the arabs as builders , and he favoured the possibility of great antiquity for the fortress by the third edition of his book ( 1902 ) he was more specific , with his primary theory being '' a semitic race and of arabian origin '' of '' strongly commercial '' traders living within a client african city other theories on the origin of the ruins , among both white settlers and academics , took a common view that the original buildings were probably not made by local bantu peoples however , archaeological evidence and recent scholarship support the construction of great zimbabwe ( and the origin of its culture ) by the shona and venda peoples in mid 1929 gertrude caton-thompson concluded , after a twelve-day visit of a three-person team and the digging of several trenches , that the site was indeed created by bantu caton-thompson 's claim was not immediately favoured , although it had strong support among some scientific archaeologists due to her modern methods her most important contribution was in helping to confirm the theory of a medieval origin for the masonry work of circa the 14th-15th century by 1931 , she had modified her bantu theory somewhat , allowing for a possible arabian influence for the towers through the imitation of buildings or art seen at the coastal arabian trading cities since the 1950s , there has been consensus among archaeologists as to the african origins of great zimbabwe archaeologists generally agree that the builders probably spoke one of the shona languages , based upon evidence of pottery , summers ( 1970 ) p195 oral traditions summers ( 1970 ) p164 and anthropology and were probably descended from the gokomere culture archaeological evidence indicates that it constitutes an early phase of the great zimbabwe culture isichei , elizabeth allo , a history of african societies to 1870 cambridge university press , 1997 , page 435 gokomere peoples were probably also related to certain nearby early bantu groups like the mapungubwe civilisation of neighbouring north eastern south africa , which is believed to have been an early venda-speaking culture , and to the nearby sotho continuity and change : an archaeological study of farming communities in northern zimbabwe ad 500–1700 today , the most recent consensus appears to attribute the construction of great zimbabwe to the shona people some evidence also suggests an early influence from the probably venda-speaking peoples of the mapungubwe civilization damage to the ruins has taken place throughout the last century thumb martin hall writes that the history of iron age research south of the zambezi shows the prevalent influence of colonial ideologies , both in the earliest speculations about the nature of the african past and in the adaptations that have been made to contemporary archaeological methodologies when white colonialists like cecil rhodes first saw the ruins , they saw them as a sign of the great riches that the area would yield to its new masters in the early 21st century , the government of zimbabwe endorsed the creation of a university in the vicinity of the ruins
