most of the designs featured a large delta wing , but in 1959 another design was offered as an offshoot of boeing 's efforts in the swing-wing tfx project ( which led to the purchase of the general dynamics f-111 instead of the boeing offering ) two projects were started , project beacon on new navigational systems and air traffic control , and project horizon on advanced civil aviation developments the basic concept behind the sst was that its fast flight would allow them to fly more trips than a subsonic aircraft , leading to higher utilization these problems were well understood within the industry ; the iata released a set of '' design imperatives '' for an sst that were essentially impossible to meet—the release was a warning to promoters of the sst within the industry by mid-1962 , it was becoming clear that tentative talks earlier that year between the british aircraft corporation and sud aviation on a merger of their sst projects were more serious than originally thought in november 1962 , still to the surprise of many , the concorde project was announced this set off something of a wave of panic in other countries , as it was widely believed that almost all future commercial aircraft would be supersonic , bill yenne , '' inside boeing : building the 777 '' as if this were not enough , it soon became known that the soviets were also working on a similar design three days after the concorde announcement , halaby wrote a letter to kennedy suggesting that if they did not immediately start their own sst effort , the us would lose 50,000 jobs , 4 billion in income , and 3 billion in capital as local carriers turned to foreign suppliers a report from the supersonic transport advisory group ( stag ) followed , noting that the european team was in the lead in basic development , and suggested competing by developing a more advanced design with better economics the baseline design in the report called for an aircraft with mach 3 performance with 2,400 mile range in order to serve the domestic market they felt that there was no way to build a transatlantic design with that performance in time to catch the concorde 's introduction , abandoning the trans-atlantic market to the europeans this might have been delayed , but in may , pan am announced they had placed options on the concorde despite not having a selected design , orders from air carriers started flowing in immediately the latter name became the best known in public , while boeing continued to use 733 model numbers internally a '' downselect '' of the proposed models resulted in the nac-60 and curtiss-wright efforts being dropped from the program , with both boeing and lockheed asked to offer sst models meeting the more demanding faa requirements and able to use either of the remaining engine designs from ge or p & w in november , another design review was held , and by this time boeing had scaled up the original design into a 250-seat model , the model 733-290 boeing predicted that if the go-ahead were given , construction of the sst prototypes would begin in early 1967 and the first flight could be made in early 1970 production aircraft could start being built in early 1969 , with the flight testing in late 1972 and certification by mid-1974 a major change in the design came when boeing added canards behind the nose—which added weight flexing of the fuselage ( it would have been the longest ever built ) threatened to make control difficult in october 1968 , the company was finally forced to abandon the variable geometry wing a promotional film claimed that airlines would soon pay back the federal investment in the project , and it was projected that ssts would dominate the skies with subsonic jumbo jets ( such as boeing 's 747 ) being only a passing intermediate fad the latter became the most significant rallying point , especially after the publication of the anti-sst paperback , sst and sonic boom handbook edited by william shurcliff , which claimed that a single flight would '' leave a 'bang-zone ' 50 miles wide by 2,000 miles long '' along with a host of associated problems supersonic flight over land in the united states was eventually banned , and several states added additional restrictions or banned concorde outright labor unions also supported the sst project , worried that the winding down of both the vietnam war and apollo program would lead to mass unemployment in the aerospace sector afl-cio president george meany suggested that the race to develop a first-generation sst was already lost , but the us should '' enter the competition for the second generation —the ssts of the 1980s and 1990s due to the loss of several government contracts and a downturn in the civilian aviation market , boeing reduced its number of employees by more than 60,000 when concorde was launched , sales were predicted to be 150 aircraft , but only 14 aircraft were actually built for commercial service these few aircraft went on to have a very long in-service flight life and were claimed to be ultimately commercially successful for their operators , until finally removed from service in the aftermath of the type 's only crash in 2000 and the 9/11 terrorist attacks when airbus decided to end servicing arrangements ultimately , supersonic passenger service was not economically competitive , and ceased with the retirement of concorde in 2003 ; , no commercial supersonic aircraft operate in the world , due largely to poor fuel economy and high maintenance costs though many designs have been studied since , it is unlikely sst aircraft will be economically feasible in the near future even faster subsonic designs , like the boeing sonic cruiser , have been met with little industry interest in an era of increasingly higher economic pressures on the airlines museum of flight while the soviet tu-144 had a short service life , nasa dryden tu-144 '' limited range and other technical problems led to service being discontinued in 1978 after only 102 passenger flights '' concorde was successful enough to fly as a small luxury fleet from 1976 until 2003 , for the most part highly profitable for the airlines in the niche transatlantic market
