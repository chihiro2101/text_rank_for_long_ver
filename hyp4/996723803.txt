for carl borgward , already the successful creator of the goliath-blitzkarren business , the misfortunes of hansa-lloyd presented an opportunity to greatly expand the scope of his auto business , and he took control of it after world war ii , in 1946 carl borgward used some of the brand names from businesses he had acquired over the years to found three separate companies : borgward , goliath and lloyd for many purposes the companies would be run as a single entity ; but in a business operated by a man to whom delegation did not come naturally , the proliferation of legal entities nevertheless added unhelpful layers of complexity through the 1950s and encouraged a broadening of the range which in the end proved financially unsustainable with the sales volumes achievable the isabella would become borgward 's most popular model and remained in production for the life of the company although borgward pioneered technical novelties in the german market such as air suspension and automatic transmission , the company had trouble competing in the marketplace while larger companies like opel and vw took advantage of economies of scale and kept their prices low to gain market share , borgward 's cost structure was even higher than necessary for its size , as it basically operated as four tiny independent companies and never implemented such basic cost reduction strategies as joint development and parts sharing between the company 's makes lloyd lost money on the car even though it was more expensive than its direct competitors this proved to be true in the sense that after the creditors were paid in full , there was still 4.5 million marks left over from the business it was strongly critical of his business approach , and included many of the arguments later advanced to explain or justify the company 's demise the widest range of cars from any manufacturer in germany , produced by three till recently operationally autonomous companies ( borgward , goliath and lloyd ) was supporting a turnover of only 650 million marks , placing the overall sales value from the combined borgward auto businesses only in fifth position among germany 's auto-makers the 70-year-old carl borgward 's '' hands-on '' insistence on an increasingly manic proliferation of new and modified models featuring adventurous , but under-developed technological innovations ( fast manische konstruierwut ) gave rise to components which too often did not work , broke down or fell apart , resulting in massive bills for pre-delivery remediation and/or post delivery warranty work that found their way back to the company capital intensive businesses such as auto manufacturing use their expensive machines and tools most efficiently if they use them constantly at full capacity , but the car market in europe in the 1950s/60s was more seasonal than today , with sales diminishing in winter , then peaking in the early summer months : borgward 's inventory of unsold cars at the end of 1960 was higher than usual , reflecting ambitious growth plans , most obviously in respect of the united states market the december 1960 der spiegel article speculated that of the 15,000 borgward cars ordered by the north american dealers in 1960 ( and of the 12,000 delivered to them ) 6,000 might have to be taken back following a slump in north american demand after a tense 13-hour meeting widely reported in a still hostile media , borgward agreed to the senate ’ s terms on 4 february 1961 , thereby averting the bankruptcy of the business two months later , however , in september 1961 , the borgward and goliath businesses were declared bankrupt , followed in november by the lloyd business in the light of what was known at the time , and increasingly in the light of subsequent events , the argument that the business was not really insolvent at all has , if anything , gained support the appointment appeared stranger still after his simultaneous appointment , in 1960 , to the board of bmw in munich , his more recent political power base and by now his adopted home city bmw had itself come close to bankruptcy in 1959 , but had been rescued thanks to a massive additional investment by herbert quandt , who became , behind the scenes , a remarkably successful “ hands-on ” principal bmw shareholder hahnemann who later would assert that the bmw 1500 , launched at the frankfurt motor show in september 1961 , created an important new niche in the german car market in a period of boom there was little doubt that the affected workers would have found job opportunities with other german automakers , but they would have needed to relocate away from bremen , and the spiegel 's description of carl borgward 's implementation of the redundancies savagely implied a singular absence of human sensitivity in west germany only opel , at this time , came close to borgward in terms of frequency of model changes and facelifts but opel were backed by the financial muscle and the strong management support of general motors , the world 's largest auto-maker and at that time itself a fabulously profitable corporation even without his own personal bmw connections , chairman semler might reasonably have concluded that the borgward business as then configured had no realistic prospect of remaining solvent for more than few more months without collapsing into a yet more destructive bankruptcy from which creditors would not recover all their cash , and which could easily end up with the company becoming a third significant foreign transplant to compete on financially unequal terms with the domestically-owned auto industry history of borgward given that all the company 's creditors were eventually paid in full , the liquidation decision appeared nevertheless to have been taken prematurely when the german parent company closed its doors in 1961 , the operation happened to have local control , and continued for a short time to complete the total manufacture of 1,050 cars during its short life in argentine territory
