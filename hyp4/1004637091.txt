however , by this point , a number of other companies — notably apple , ibm , microsoft , and even sun itself — were claiming they would soon be releasing similar object-oriented operating systems and development tools of their own ) on february 4 , 1997 , apple computer acquired next for 427 million , and used openstep as the basis for mac os x , as it was called at the time after considering the purchase of beos — a multimedia-enabled , multi-tasking os designed for hardware similar to apple 's , the company decided instead to acquire next and use openstep as the basis for their new os at first , the plan was to develop a new operating system based almost entirely on an updated version of openstep , with the addition of a virtual machine subsystem — known as the blue box — for running '' classic '' macintosh applications over the next two years , major effort was applied to porting the original macintosh apis to unix libraries known as carbon mac os applications could be ported to carbon without the need for a complete re-write , making them operate as native applications on the new operating system meanwhile , applications written using the older toolkits would be supported using the '' classic '' mac os 9 environment the first release of the new os — mac os x server 1.0 — used a modified version of the mac os gui , but all client versions starting with mac os x developer preview 3 used a new theme known as aqua with the exception of mac os x server 1.0 and the original public beta , the first several macos versions were named after big cats on september 13 , 2000 , apple released a 29.95 '' preview '' version of mac os x ( internally codenamed kodiak ) in order to gain feedback from users it marked the first public availability of the aqua interface , and apple made many changes to the ui based on customer feedback for instance , a q & a was created in 2005 which mentions it the initial version was slow , incomplete , and had very few applications available at the time of its launch , mostly from independent developers simply releasing mac os x was received by the macintosh community as a great accomplishment , for attempts to completely overhaul the mac os had been underway since 1996 , and delayed by countless setbacks on january 7 , 2002 , apple announced that mac os x was to be the default operating system for all macintosh products by the end of that month on august 23 , 2002 , apple followed up with mac os x 10.2 jaguar , the first release to use its code name as part of the branding see apple.com , '' jaguar '' press release , compared to mac os x 10.0 press release and mac os x 10.1 press release it brought great raw performance improvements , a sleeker look , and many powerful user-interface enhancements ( over 150 , according to apple ) , including quartz extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ati radeon or nvidia geforce2 mx agp-based video card with at least 16 mb of vram , a system-wide repository for contact information in the new address book , and an instant messaging client named ichat the happy mac which had appeared during the mac os startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey apple logo with the introduction of mac os x 10.2 panther included as many or more new features as jaguar had the year before , including an updated finder , incorporating a brushed-metal interface , fast user switching , exposé ( window manager ) , filevault , safari , ichat av ( which added videoconferencing features to ichat ) , improved portable document format ( pdf ) rendering and much greater microsoft windows interoperability apple stated that tiger contained more than 200 new features the initial release of the apple tv used a modified version of tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services this operating system functioned identically on the powerpc-based macs and the new intel-based machines , with the exception of the intel release dropping support for the classic environment new features include a new look , an updated finder , time machine , spaces , boot camp pre-installed , full support for 64-bit applications ( including graphical applications ) , new features in mail and ichat , and a number of new security features leopard dropped support for the classic environment and all classic applications , and was the final version of mac os x to support the powerpc architecture for most users , the most noticeable changes are these : the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean installation compared to mac os x leopard , a more responsive finder rewritten in cocoa , faster time machine backups , more reliable and user friendly disk ejects , a more powerful version of the preview application , as well as a faster safari web browser apple also made changes to applications : they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed ( similar to ios ) it incorporates some features seen in ios 5 , which include game center , support for imessage in the new messages messaging application , and reminders as a to-do list app separate from ical ( which is renamed as calendar , like the ios app ) notification center , which makes its debut in mountain lion , is a desktop version similar to the one in ios 5.0 and higher unlike previous versions of os x , which had progressively decreasing prices since 10.6 , 10.9 was available at no charge to all users of compatible systems running snow leopard ( 10.6 ) or later , beginning apple 's policy of free upgrades for life on its operating system and business software os x yosemite was released to the general public on october 16 , 2014 , as a free update through the mac app store worldwide apple described this release as containing '' refinements to the mac experience '' and '' improvements to system performance '' rather than new features metal api , an application enhancing software , had debuted in this operating system , being available to '' all macs since 2012 '' the release includes many under-the-hood improvements , including a switch to apple file system , the introduction of metal 2 , support for hevc video , and improvements to vr support it is the first version of macos not to support 32-bit applications the major version number is changed , for the first time since '' mac os x '' was released , making it macos 11
