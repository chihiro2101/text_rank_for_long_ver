the patricians had developed into the upper class by monopolising the priesthoods , which played an important part in the politics of archaic rome and , in the early republic , the consulship ( the office of the two annual elected heads of the roman republic and the army ) , and the seats of the ( unelected ) senate , the advisory body for the consuls this led to the first secessio plebis ( 494 bc ) , which was the start of the conflict of the orders however , the plebeian demands were not fully met rather , they obtained the recognition of the institutions which they had created during the rebellion , the plebeian council ( an assembly restricted to plebeians where they could debate their issues ) cornell , the beginnings of rome , pp & nbsp ; 259–260 the latter acted as the defenders of the plebeians from abuse by consuls or officials through the provocatio , the power to veto the actions of the consuls and officials livy said '' two states had been created out of one ; each faction had its own magistrates officials , its own laws '' livy , the history of rome , 2.44.9 the main role of the plebeian institutions in the early days of the conflict of the orders was self-defence ) , chapter 7 , from protection and decense to offense and participation : stages in the conflict of the orders the next step in the conflict was the lex terentilia proposed by terentilius , a plebeian tribune , in 462 & nbsp ; bc they asked the senate to “ consent to the appointment of a body of legislators , chosen in equal numbers from plebeians and patricians to enact what would be useful to both orders and secure equal liberty for each ” livy , the history of rome , 3.32 the patricians replied that this was worthy of consideration , but said that only patricians could legislate although disputed by historians such as niebuhr , cornell and grant , according to livy and dionysius , three envoys were sent to athens to study the law of solon and inquire about the laws of other greek city-states in 452 & nbsp ; bc the envoys “ returned with the laws of athens so was one of the consuls of the previous year ( 452 bc ) , publius sestius capitolinus vaticanus , because he had put the proposal to the senate despite the opposition of his colleague there was a general feeling that two more tables were needed to have a corpus of all roman law when they issued the two additional tables there was no longer any justification for their rule and people looked forward to elections however , when the time came , they were not held and the decimviri became violent however , the senators denounced the decemviri and tried to oppose them , called them private citizens and refused to call a levy in the end they allowed its proclamation of the levy in silence because they feared a popular uprising would bolster the plebeian tribunes , their political adversaries however , the messengers had already arrived and verginius had already been given leave according to livy , verginius stabbed his daughter to death saying that that was the only way he could assert her freedom two patricians , lucius valerius potitus and marcus horatius barbatus pushed the lictors back , announcing that “ if appius proceeded legally , they would protect icilius from the prosecution of a mere citizen ; if he sought to make use of violence , there too they would be a match for him the senate decided to take no harsh action as it had been partly responsible for the mutiny verginius proposed the election of ten leaders to be given the military title , military tribune on hearing of the election of military tribunes at the aventine , icilius , thinking that these men would then be elected as plebeian tribunes and wanting to become one himself , arranged the election of the same number of '' military tribunes '' among these soldiers , who headed for rome , marched through the city and to the aventine the latter said that they would do so only after the enactment of the two tables of laws for which they were elected some senators , including valerius and horatius , argued that their restoration was needed in order to both get rid of the decemviri and restore patrician magistrates then '' they not only restored a consular law about the appeal , but they also safeguarded it for the future by the solemn enactment of a new law , that no one should declare the election of any magistrate without appeal , and that he who should so declare might be put to death by anyone without offence to law or religion , and that such a homicide should not be held a capital crime they also introduced the practice of delivering the decrees of the senate to the aediles at the temple of ceres , “ up to that time they were wont to be suppressed or falsified , at the pleasure of the consuls '' in addition , the plebeian council passed a law whereby those who left the plebeians without tribunes or elected a magistrate without appeal were to be scourged and beheaded however , he said that he would arrest appius claudius unless he named a referee who could prove that he had not illegally adjudged a free citizen to the custody of one who claimed her as a slave appius claudius asked for a trial to assess whether his new laws had established tyranny or freedom and whether the appeal '' had been merely a parade of meaningless forms , or had been really granted the reason why the first decemvirate had a dual role -- as a new magistracy which replaced the consuls and took on governance with extraordinary powers , and as a commission for compiling law -- is not explained by the sources a theory has tried to explain this contradiction by positing that the first decemvirate differed from the second one by being a commission to compile laws , while the latter was a permanent governing body 296 cornell notes that if this was the case the consuls and the plebeian tribunes would have been suspended at the start of the second decemvirate instead of the first moreover , that the second decemvirate was elected because it was felt that two new tables were needed implies that the decemvirate was meant to be a temporary body for the duration of the drawing up of the laws if this was the case , the fact that livy seemed to suggest that only patricians sat on the first decemvirate would be a contradiction genucius , who had a plebeian name , have led some historians to reject both that this man was a decemvir and the existence of a second decemvirate , which they see as fiction some historians see the sharp contrast between the first , good decemvirate and the second , bad one as a legend to explain the twelve tables in general being good while the prohibition of marriage between patricians and plebeians was bad if this was a fiction to explain this law , why were the last two tables ( one of which contained this law ) published by the consuls for 449 & nbsp ; bc after the deposition of the bad decemvirate ? why was a law banning marriage between patricians and plebeians drawn up by a body composed by both patricians and plebeians ( the majority of the members of the second decemvirate being plebeians ) ? cornell , t.j forsythe sees similarities with the story of the decemviri , where the republican offices are suspended and replaced by the decemviri who were also tasked with drafting new laws , who then refused to leave office when their term was up , became tyrannical , were forced to resign by a secession and the republican offices were restored the first decemvirate represents “ ideal aristocratic rule in its ideal form , followed by the corrupt oligarchy of the second one whose misrule leads to rebellion and further political change therefore , although the later historians who have given us the accounts of the decemvirate might have added additional elaborations , there is no evidence that they made up the core story appius claudius was the victim of a later tradition of hostility towards the claudii , his family ( mommsen showed traces of this , but did not see it as a reason for rejecting the story ) ; the character of verginia bears similarities with that of lucretia , whose rape led to the overthrow of the monarchy ( ogilvie notes that in the original story might not have provided names and that she may have been referred to as ‘ a maiden ’ and the name verginia was ascribed to her later , but she did exist ) ; the story was the subject of a traditional ballade if it had gone to athens , by that time the law of solon would have been replaced by the radical reforms of pericles in the first half of the 5th century bc he thinks that the source was likely to have been the greek cities of southern italy and that it is there that efforts to familiarise with greek written laws would have been directed he also points out that according to an alternative tradition the decemviri were advised by hermodorus of ephesus , a greek philosopher in exile the decemviri stlitibus judicandis ( '' the ten men who judge lawsuits '' ) was a civil court of ancient origin ( traditionally attributed to king servius tullius ) mainly concerned with questions bearing on the status of individuals it originally served as a jury rendering verdicts under the presidency of the praetor , but these decemviri subsequently became annual minor magistrates ( magistratus minores ) of the republic , elected by the roman assemblies and forming part of the vigintisexviri ( '' twenty-six men '' ) membership in this ecclesiastical college ( collegium ) was for life , and the college was increased to a quindecimvirate—that is , a college of fifteen members—and renamed accordingly ( see quindecimviri sacris faciundis ) in the last century of the republic , possibly by the dictator lucius cornelius sulla ; the dictator julius caesar added a sixteenth member , but this precedent was not followed
