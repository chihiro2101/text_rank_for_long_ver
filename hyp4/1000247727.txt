however , the influence of american english modes of expression and slang is strong , particularly among malaysian youth while english is widely used , many malay words have become part of common usage in informal english or manglish an example is suffixing sentences with lah , as in , '' do n't be so worried-lah '' , which is usually used to present a sentence as rather light-going and not so serious ; the suffix has no specific meaning however , chinese dialects also make abundant use of the suffix lah and there is some disagreement as to which language it was originally borrowed from while all varieties of english used by malaysians may be considered malaysian english , some make a distinction between malaysian english and manglish ; malaysian english being a form of english that largely follows the standard rules of english grammar but with some local characteristics , while manglish is a pidgin that does not follow the grammatical rules or structure of english many malaysians however tend to refer to the colloquialisms used by those taught in english-medium school as malaysian english , while some argued for the basilect form or pidgin as the '' real '' malaysian english at the lexical level , limited lexis is used and consequently , a number of words serve a variety of functions , giving extended meanings not normally accepted in standard british english the term malaysian english is not used in any official context except for the ever-changing school curriculum modules in attempts to improve the command of english but without going into advanced lessons it is however , possible to speak manglish without substituting english words with those from another language speakers of manglish from the country 's different ethnic groups tend to intersperse varying amounts of expressions or interjections from their mother tongue – be it malay , chinese or one of the indian languages – which , in some cases , qualifies as a form of code-switching people tend to translate phrases directly from their first languages into english , for instance , '' on the light '' instead of '' turn on the light '' or sometimes , '' open the light '' , translated directly from chinese aside from borrowing lexicons and expressions at varying levels depending on the speaker 's mother tongue , malay , chinese and tamil also influence manglish at a sentence formation level instead , information about time is often acquired through contextual knowledge or time-specific markers such as ‘ yesterday ’ , ‘ today ’ and ‘ tomorrow ’ this is also replicated in manglish with sentences like ‘ she go to the shop yesterday ’ and ‘ i come here every day ’ chinese , malay and tamil languages often duplicate words for different functions such as to show pluralisation , emphasis or repetition similarly , this has influenced the duplication of english words when speaking manglish , especially when placing emphasis on certain words or to show pluralisation '' terrer '' – ( pronounced as the english '' terror '' ) refers to someone or something being awesomely amazing or good ( e.g '' la-la '' replaces the older derogatory term '' ah lien '' that is used to describe girls who wear heavy make-up and outstanding clothes and accessories , which usually end up being rather bad taste instead of looking sophisticated or in fashion '' la-la '' can also be used to describe the things these girls are known to wear used when wanting to put an emphasis on something saying it is great or big—whether it is in a good or bad way does not matter as long as it is '' huge '' e.g '' means , '' i got shafted/reprimanded/caught '' ) '' kena '' – to experience/get caught/punished ; often used like a noun ( '' i sure kena if i cheat '' ) '' kenasai '' / '' kanasai '' – to get into trouble , a mix of malay kena meaning '' get '' or '' meet '' and hokkien sai ( 屎 , faeces ) to form the phrase '' hit by shit '' '' ) '' pengsan '' – to faint ( malay ) '' pon '' – to skip school/play truant/apon ( from malay '' ponteng '' , meaning the same ) '' saman '' – to issue a fine , usually in relation to a traffic offence , from '' summons '' '' ) '' sit '' – since this is the word used for riding in a vehicle in malay and in chinese dialects , it is used in the same way in english , e.g '' ( meaning '' he 's the one cheating me ! '' ) it is also equivalent to simply saying '' obviously '' '' die/finish/gone/habis/mampus/mampui/sei/see/gg/pok kai/ '' – generic exclamations from various languages to indicate '' trouble '' , used like the english '' dead '' or '' dead end '' , but the word '' die '' does not mean to die literally '' podaa ! '' – from tamil equivalent to the american phrase , '' get out ! '' when expressing disbelief '' walao eh '' – also an exclamation of amazement , either from hokkien or teochew , but came via singapore '' wah '' - to express amazement '' it '' does n't refer to the subject , but rather to the entire preceding clause ( '' is it so ? '' ) this is comparable to the french phrase '' n'est-ce pas ? '' ( literally '' is n't it ? '' ) and the german usage of '' '' open collar , pocket no dollar '' – expression reflecting linkage between extravagant appearance and persona , and illusion of wealth '' that 's why '' - expression used to express agreement with a statement ( example : '' it 's so hot today ! '' '' that 's why ! '' ) the ubiquitous word lah or , used at the end of a sentence , can also be described as a particle that simultaneously asserts a position and entices solidarity in malay , 'lah ' is used to change a verb into a command or to soften its tone , particularly when usage of the verb may seem impolite in cantonese , lah ( 啦 ) is placed at the end of a sentence in imperatives making it sound more like a request than an order lah can also be used to emphasize items in a spoken list , appearing after each item in the list but is not commonly used in this context for example : where are you ar ? ( this is especially of chinese origin for example , to show argumentative mood or making emphasis , one would say , '' you lo ( it 's your fault ) , if it 's not for you we would n't be in trouble now ! '' and possibly in response , the other would say , '' eh , i never forced you to follow me here loh ! '' another example is '' traffic jam loh ! '' when asked by a friend why he or she is late to an occasion the particle what , also spelled wat/wot , is used to remind or contradict the listener , especially when strengthening another assertion that follows from the current one : though very similar to spoken singlish , the two should not be considered the same variety manglish is non-rhotic sometimes referred to as r-fullness/r-lessness , spoken manglish is similar to the standard variety of english in singapore and britain , in that the final /r/ consonant is dropped during speech for instance , 'father ' is pronounced as /fʌdə/ instead of /fɑːðə/ for instance , 'so ' and 'go ' are pronounced as /so/ and /go/ instead of /soʊ/ and /goʊ/ '' there is '' / '' there are '' and '' has '' / '' have '' are both expressed using got , so that sentences can be translated in either way back into british / american english for example , “ you ” in the following sentences is omittable ) “ ( you ) always also can not , can not , can not ” ( you always prohibit ( me ) from doing something ) for example , '' kena '' ( a malay word , somewhat of a prefix added for the sake of turning an action verb into passive form ) might be more often used in manglish ; while singlish more frequently uses words like '' liao '' ( meaning '' already '' in hokkien ) , '' nia '' ( meaning '' only '' in hokkien ) however , referring the aforementioned example , '' kena '' is also used in singlish and '' liao '' in mangish , only to a less extent
