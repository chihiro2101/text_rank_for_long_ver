guderian finished the war as an operations officer in occupied italy early in 1919 , guderian was selected as one of the four thousand officers allowed by the versailles treaty in the reduced-size german army , the reichswehr he was assigned to serve on the staff of the central command of the eastern frontier guard service which was intended to control and coordinate the independent freikorps units in the defense of germany 's eastern frontiers against polish and soviet forces engaged in the russian civil war he studied the leading european literature on armored warfare and between 1922 and 1928 wrote five papers for military weekly , an armed forces journal while the topics covered were mundane , guderian related them to why germany had lost world war i , a controversial subject at the time , and thus raised his profile in the military in 1927 , guderian was promoted to major and in october he was posted to the transport section of the truppenamt , a clandestine form of the army 's general staff , which had been forbidden by the treaty of versailles in the 1930s guderian played a significant role in the development of both the panzer division concept and a doctrine of mechanized offensive warfare that would later become known as blitzkrieg at short notice he was ordered to spearhead the northern element of the invasion of poland which began on 1 september guderian used the german concept of '' leading forward '' , which required commanders to move to the battle-front and assess the situation foremost in his mind was the '' liberation '' of his former family estate at gross-klonia ; guderian ordered the advance on gross-klonia at night and through fog , leading to what he subsequently admitted were '' serious casualties '' a british counter-attack at arras on 21 may slowed down the german advance and allowed bef to establish defenses around points of evacuation , while hitler , conscious of potential reverses and of allowing unsupported armor into urban fighting , issued the order to halt a general resumption of the attack was ordered on 26 may , but by that time the allied forces rallied offering stiff resistance despite the success of the invasion , french defeat was not inevitable ; the french had better , more numerous military equipment and were not overwhelmed by a numerically or technologically superior military force instead , the french loss stemmed from poor army morale , faulty military strategy and a lack of coordination among allied troops hitler and his generals became over-confident after their historic victory , and came to believe they could defeat the soviet union , a country with significantly more natural resources , manpower and industrial capacity in guderian 's 1937 book achtung — panzer ! he wrote that '' the time has passed when the russians had no instinct for technology '' and that germany would have to reckon '' with the eastern question in a form more serious than ever before in history '' however , during the planning for operation barbarossa , the german invasion of the soviet union , he had become optimistic about the supposed superiority of german arms however , the campaign had been costly ; the german forces had just half the tanks they had three months earlier guderian demanded an inquiry into the realities of tank warfare on the eastern front , eventually suggesting in november to senior german tank designers and manufacturers that the quickest solution was to produce a direct copy of the soviet t-34 tank facing pressure from the german high command , field marshal günther von kluge finally committed the weaker south flank of his 4th army to the attack on 1 december in the aftermath of the battle , guderian blamed slow commitment of 4th army to the attack for the german failure to reach moscow in the aftermath of the german failure , guderian refused to pass on hitler 's 'stand fast ' order and fell out with kluge , the new commander of the army group centre however , general joachim lemelsen , a corps commander within guderian 's panzer group , is documented as saying '' prisoners , who could be shown to have been commissars , had to be immediately taken aside and shot '' and that the order came directly from guderian on 1 march 1943 , after the german defeat in the battle of stalingrad , hitler appointed guderian to the newly created position of inspector general of armoured troops operation citadel , the last major german offensive operation in the east , was an attempt by the german army to regain the initiative in a conversation with hitler prior to the offensive , guderian said : '' why are we attacking in the east at all this year ? '' hitler responded , '' you are right guderian became the acting chief of the general staff of the army high command with the responsibility of advising hitler on the eastern front he replaced general of the infantry kurt zeitzler , who had abandoned the position on 1 july after losing faith in hitler 's judgement and suffering a nervous breakdown germany was already heading to inevitable defeat and guderian could not shape the military situation nor hitler 's strategic decisions post-war , guderian claimed that he had attempted to get out of this duty and that he had found the sessions '' repulsive '' guderian had to fill serious gaps , such as one created by the suicide of general eduard wagner , the quartermaster general , in july the situation was not improved by guderian 's long-standing bias against the general staff which he blamed for having allegedly opposed his attempts to introduce modern armored doctrine into the army back in the 1930s after the war , guderian blamed hitler for frittering away the last german reserves in the operation ; nonetheless , germany 's strategic situation was such that even twenty or thirty extra divisions would not have helped guderian completed the total nazification of the army general staff with a 29 july order that demanded all officers join the party he also made the nazi salute obligatory throughout the armed forces after the war , guderian claimed that his actions in the final months as head of the okh were driven by a search for a solution to germany 's increasingly bleak prospects this fantastical plan had no hope of succeeding against the mobile operations of the red army on 6 march 1945 , shortly before the end of the war , guderian participated in a propaganda broadcast that denied the holocaust ; the red army in its advance had just liberated several extermination camps despite the general 's later claims of being anti-nazi , hitler most likely found guderian 's values to be closely aligned with nazi ideology hitler brought him out of retirement in 1943 and especially appreciated the orders he issued in the aftermath of the failed plot he joined the us army historical division in 1945 and the us refused requests from the soviet union to have him extradited at that time they were the only source on the development of panzer forces , german military records having been misplaced or lost 1 pow camp in grizedale hall in the north of england from 9 august 1945 as a political intelligence department lecturer taking part in the re-education programme , in an effort to use that to re-establish his reputation as a military theorist and commentator , asked guderian to say that he had based his military theories on liddell hart 's ; guderian obliged guderian was a capable tactician and technician , leading his troops successfully in the invasion of poland , the battle of france and during the early stages of the invasion of the soviet union , especially in the advance to smolensk and the battle of kiev he also played a large role in the commission of reprisals after the warsaw uprising of 1944 guderian also did not mention that he had initially requested an estate three times larger , but he was turned down by the local gauleiter , with support from himmler in 1950 , guderian published a pamphlet entitled can europe be defended ? , where he lamented that the western powers had picked the wrong side to ally themselves with during the war , even as germany '' was fighting for its naked existence '' , as a '' defender of europe '' against the supposed bolshevik menace he claimed that only the nazi civilian administration ( not the wehrmacht ) was responsible for atrocities against soviet civilians and scapegoated hitler and the russian winter for the wehrmacht 's military reverses , as he later did in panzer leader ; in addition , he wrote that six million germans died during their expulsion from the eastern territories by the soviet union and its allies , guderian , heinz guderian claimed , contrary to historical evidence , that the criminal commissar order was not carried out by his troops because it '' never reached his panzer group '' in his book operation barbarossa and germany 's defeat in the east , stahel wrote : '' the men in control of hitler 's armies were not honourable men , carrying out their orders as dutiful servants of the state guderian thus came across as a consummate professional who stood apart from the crimes of the nazi regime guderian reviews the development of armoured forces in the european nations and soviet russia , and describes what he felt was essential for the effective use of armoured forces
