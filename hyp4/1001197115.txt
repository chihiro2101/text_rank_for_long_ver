during world war i , the united states manufactured a significant number of curtiss jn-4 “ jenny ” biplanes to train its military aviation and almost every u.s many of these were reliable and even advanced designs which suffered from the failure of the aviation market to expand as expected , and a number of these found their way into the only active markets—mail carrying , barnstorming , and smuggling sometimes a plane and its owner would drift between the three activities as opportunity presented ” “ more than any single event , lindbergh 's historic 1927 flight made americans aware of the potential of commercial aviation , and there followed a boom in aviation activity during 1928 and 1929 ” in fact , charles lindbergh engaged in barnstorming in his early years ; errold bahl hired him as an assistant , and as a promotional stunt , lindbergh “ volunteered to climb out onto the wing and wave to the crowds below , ” which came to be known as “ wing-walking some pilots , however , continued to wander the country giving rides as late as fall 1941 most barnstorming shows started with a pilot , or team of pilots flying over a small rural town to attract local attention they would then land at a local farm ( hence the term “ barnstorming ” ) and negotiate for the use of a field as a temporary runway from which to stage an air show and offer airplane rides after obtaining a base of operation , the pilot or group of aviators would “ buzz ” the village and drop flyers in some towns the arrival of a barnstormer or an aerial troupe would lead to a town-wide shutdown as people attended the show although barnstormers often worked in solitude or in very small teams , some also put together large “ flying circuses ” with several planes and stunt people these acts employed promoters to book shows in towns ahead of time for example , it allowed charles lindbergh to make a marginal living , and he always spoke fondly of the “ old flying days ” and the freedom of movement
