the romans referred to tongeren as aduatuca tungrorum or atuatuca tongrorum , and it was the capital of the large roman province of civitas tungrorum , an area which covered modern belgian limburg , and at least parts of all the areas around it there are counter arguments that the word '' aduatuca '' was probably a general word for a fort in this region , meaning that there might have been more places with the same name , and that tongeren shows no signs of pre-roman occupation , nor the hilly terrain described by caesar the tungri , not mentioned by caesar , came to dominate this area in the roman era , and are the reason for the name of the modern name tongeren but many modern writers believe that the gallo-roman population of the area contained a significant amount of more recent germanic immigrants from across the rhine located on the important road linking cologne to bavay via the relay of liberchies , and surrounded by the fertile lands of the hesbaye region , roman tongeren quickly became one of the largest gallo-roman administrative and military towns in the first century in the second century , it erected a defensive wall , portions of which can still be seen today in the meantime , the franks to the north and east were pagan and so many areas had to be reconverted over the course of the following centuries , with several missionaries becoming martyrs this was the resting place of saint lambert of maastricht , one of the last missionaries in the area , who died about 700 ad the building of a new church and the foundation of a chapter of canons took place in carolingian times , at the very place where the old bishops ’ houses stood , and where the basilica still stands today the thirteenth century also saw the building of the medieval defensive wall , several new churches and cloisters , and the beguinage the city became one of the “ good cities ” ( '' good cities '' ) of the prince-bishopric of liège its enclosure wall was destroyed in the nineteenth century : it separated the beguinage from the rest of the city and thus guaranteed peace and quiet for the small religion-inspired community in the seventeenth century the beguinage counted some 300 beguines ; it was also able to survive the 1677 fire that destroyed most of the city archaeological excavations have proven the presence of an edifice here starting from the fourth century , while a carolingian prayer house existed here in the ninth century at the location of a former roman temple in the keverstraat , a modern representation of that temple can be found this religious procession , the largest and one of the most impressive in belgium , took place for the seventeenth time in 2009
