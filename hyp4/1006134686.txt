it is also possible to draw the film in both directions simultaneously , although the equipment required for this is somewhat more elaborate the heat setting step prevents the film from shrinking back to its original unstretched shape and locks in the molecular orientation in the film plane if it were produced without any additives , the surface of the film would be so smooth that layers would adhere strongly to one another when the film is wound up , similar to the sticking of clean glass plates when stacked the result is much less permeable to gases ( important in food packaging ) and reflects up to 99 % of light , including much of the infrared spectrum laminates containing metallized bopet foil ( in technical language called printin or laminate web substrate ) protect food against oxidation and aroma loss , achieving long shelf life protective covering over buttons/pins/badges the glossy top layer of a polaroid sx-70 photographic print as a backing for very fine sandpaper bopet film is used in bagging comic books , in order to best protect them during storage from environmental conditions ( moisture , heat , and cold ) that would otherwise cause paper to slowly deteriorate over time while bopet is widely ( and effectively ) used in this archival sense , it is not immune to the effects of fire and heat and could potentially melt , depending on the intensity of the heat source , causing further damage to the encased item metallized bopet is intended to be used for solar sails as an alternative means of propulsion for spacecraft such as cosmos 1 translucent mylar film , as wide as 48 '' and in up to 12 ' in length , found widespread use as a non-dimensional engineering drawing media in the aerospace industry due to its dimensional stability ( also see printing media section below ) this allows production and engineering staff to lay manufactured parts directly over or under the drawing film in order to verify the fidelity of part profiles , hole locations and other part features aluminized , as an inexpensive solar eclipse viewer , although care must be taken , because invisible fissures can form in the metal film , reducing its effectiveness bopet films are often annealed to a glass element to improve thermal conductivity , and guarantee the necessary flat surface needed for even telescopic solar observation photomultiplier cosmic-ray observatories often make use of these mirrors for inexpensive large ( 1.0 m and above ) , lightweight mirror surfaces for sky-sector low and medium energy cosmic ray research the descent stage of the apollo 's lunar module is covered in bopet because it 's lightweight and made sure the inside temperature of the inside of the desecent stage ( where a significant amount of apperature was stored ) was normal bopet film has been used in the production of banjo & drumheads since 1958 due to its durability and acoustical properties when stretched over the bearing edge of the drum they are made in single- and double-ply versions , with each ply being in thickness , with a transparent or opaque surface , originally used by the company evans clear and white bopet films are used as core layers and overlays in smart cards although '' blueprint '' duplication has fallen out of use , mylar is still used for its archival properties , typically as a record set of plans for building departments to keep on file route information signs , called rollsigns or destination blinds , displayed by public transport vehicles for materials in kites covering glass to decrease probability of shattering in theatre effects such as confetti as the adhesive strip to attach the string to a teabag one of the many materials used as windsavers or valves for valved harmonicas on farmland and domestic gardens , highly reflective aluminized pet film ribbons are used to keep birds away from plants
