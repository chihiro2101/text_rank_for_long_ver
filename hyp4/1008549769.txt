then , each student 's score would be a realization of one of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables , with an expected mean of 50 thus the mean of these students would '' regress '' all the way back to the mean of all students who took the original test if there were no luck ( good or bad ) or random guessing involved in the answers supplied by the students – then all students would be expected to score the same on the second test as they scored on the original test , and there would be no regression toward the mean most realistic situations fall between these two extremes : for example , one might consider exam scores as a combination of skill and luck hence , those who did well previously are unlikely to do quite as well in the second test even if the original can not be replicated the following is an example of this second kind of regression toward the mean the phenomenon occurs because student scores are determined in part by underlying ability and in part by chance similarly , students who unluckily score less than their ability on the first test will tend to see their scores increase on the second test similarly , regression towards the mean is an explanation for the sports illustrated cover jinx — periods of exceptional performance which results in a cover feature are likely to be followed by periods of more mediocre performance , giving the impression that appearing on the cover causes an athlete 's decline rather , the characteristics in the offspring regress towards a mediocre point ( a point which has since been identified as the mean ) in addition , height is not entirely genetically determined , but also subject to environmental influences during development , which make offspring of exceptional parents even more likely to be closer to the average than their parents in contrast , the term '' regression to the mean '' is now often used to describe the phenomenon by which an initial sampling bias may disappear as new , repeated , or larger samples display sample means that are closer to the true underlying population mean take a hypothetical example of 1,000 individuals of a similar age who were examined and scored on the risk of experiencing a heart attack statistics could be used to measure the success of an intervention on the 50 who were rated at the greatest risk even if the interventions are worthless , the test group would be expected to show an improvement on their next physical exam , because of regression toward the mean even if the program is effective , their average scores may well be less when the test is repeated a year later in the student test example above , it was assumed implicitly that what was being measured did not change between the two measurements to the extent that a score is determined randomly , or that a score has random variation or error , as opposed to being determined by the student 's academic ability or being a '' true value '' , the phenomenon will have an effect although extreme individual measurements regress toward the mean , the second sample of measurements will be no closer to the mean than the first so for extreme individuals , we expect the second score to be closer to the mean than the first score , but for all individuals , we expect the distribution of distances from the mean to be the same on both sets of measurements related to the point above , regression toward the mean works equally well in both directions and if we compare the best student on the first day to the best student on the second day , regardless of whether it is the same individual or not , there is a tendency to regress toward the mean going in either direction an extreme example is horace secrist 's 1933 book the triumph of mediocrity in business , in which the statistics professor collected mountains of data to prove that the profit rates of competitive businesses tend toward the average over time to put kahneman 's story in simple terms , when one makes a severe mistake , their performance will later usually return to their average level anyway in the contrary situation , when one happens to perform high above average , their performance will also tend to return to their average level later on ; the change will be perceived as a deterioration and any initial praise following the first performance as a cause of that deterioration the times , 16 december 2005 speed camera benefits overrated statistical analysts have long recognized the effect of regression to the mean in sports ; they even have a special name for it : the '' sophomore slump '' because popular lore has focused on regression toward the mean as an account of declining performance of athletes from one season to the next , it has usually overlooked the fact that such regression can also account for improved performance regression toward the mean simply says that , following an extreme random event , the next random event is likely to be less extreme similarly , the law of large numbers states that in the long term , the average will tend towards the expected value , but makes no statement about individual trials for example , following a run of 10 heads on a flip of a fair coin ( a rare , extreme event ) , regression to the mean states that the next run of heads will likely be less than 10 , while the law of large numbers states that in the long term , this event will likely average out , and the average fraction of heads will tend to 1/2
