fixed costs , which occur only in the short run , are incurred by the business at any level of output , including zero output entrepreneur.com marginal cost and marginal revenue , depending on whether the calculus approach is taken or not , are defined as either the change in cost or revenue as each additional unit is produced , or the derivative of cost or revenue with respect to the quantity of output right to obtain the profit maximizing output quantity , we start by recognizing that profit is equal to total revenue ( tr ) minus total cost ( tc ) in the accompanying diagram , the linear total revenue curve represents the case in which the firm is a perfect competitor in the goods market , and thus can not set its own selling price this output level is also the one at which the total profit curve is at its maximum right an equivalent perspective relies on the relationship that , for each unit sold , marginal profit ( mπ ) equals marginal revenue ( mr ) minus marginal cost ( mc ) in calculus terms , the requirement that the optimal output have higher profit than adjacent output levels is that : : \frac , where and refer to the midpoints between the old and new values of price and quantity respectively that is , selling the extra unit results in a small drop in price which reduces the revenue for all units sold by the amount q ( ∆p/∆q ) the intuition behind this result is that , if demand is inelastic at some value q 1 then a decrease in q would increase p more than proportionately , thereby increasing revenue pq ; since lower q would also lead to lower total cost , profit would go up due to the combination of increased revenue and decreased cost the general rule is that the firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost to maximize profit the firm should increase usage of the input '' up to the point where the input 's marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs '' the marginal revenue product is the change in total revenue per unit change in the variable input
