it is common for patients suffering from micropsia to be able to indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are epileptiform abnormalities including spikes and sharp waves in the temporal lobe of the brain can diagnose this condition , which can in turn be the cause of an epilepsy patient 's micropsia due to the large range of causes that lead to micropsia , diagnosis varies among cases mri and ct techniques are able to rule out lesions as the cause for micropsia , but are not sufficient to diagnose the most common causes hemimicropsia is a type of cerebral micropsia that occurs within one half of the visual field these seizures affect the entire visual field of the patient this in turn only affects one half of the visual field and is accompanied by other cerebral visual disturbances although drug-induced changes in perception usually subside as the chemical leaves the body , long-term cocaine use can result in the chronic residual effect of micropsia psychiatric patients may experience micropsia in an attempt to distance themselves from situations involving conflict micropsia may also be a symptom of psychological conditions in which patients visualize people as small objects as a way to control others in response to their insecurities and feelings of weakness in some adults who experienced loneliness as children , micropsia may arise as a mirror of prior feelings of separation from people and objects after surgery , patients may experience micropsia as a result of larger photoreceptor separation by edematous fluid lesions affecting other parts of the extracerebral visual pathways can also cause micropsia treatment varies for micropsia due to the large number of different causes for the condition even further , numerous cases suggest that size perception may be dissociated from other aspects of visual perception such as color and movement however , more research is called for to correctly relate the condition to defined physiological conditions current research is being done on macular degeneration which could help prevent cases of micropsia these treatments for the first time have produced actual improvements in vision , rather than simply delaying or arresting the continued loss of vision characteristic of macular degeneration
