cam software would output code for the least capable machine , as each machine tool control added on to the standard g-code set for increased flexibility none of these issues were so insurmountable that a thoughtful engineer or skilled machine operator could not overcome for prototyping or small production runs ; g-code is a simple language in high production or high precision shops , a different set of problems were encountered where an experienced cnc machinist must both hand-code programs and run cam software the output from the cam software is usually a simple text file of g-code/m-codes , sometimes many thousands of commands long , that is then transferred to a machine tool using a direct numerical control ( dnc ) program or in modern controllers using a common usb storage device users would select the type of tool , machining process and paths to be used while an engineer may have a working knowledge of g-code programming , small optimization and wear issues compound over time this is occurring primarily in three arenas : ease of usage manufacturing complexity integration with plm and the extended enterprise ; ease in use : for the user who is just getting started as a cam user , out-of-the-box capabilities providing process wizards , templates , libraries , machine tool kits , automated feature based machining and job function specific tailorable user interfaces build user confidence and speed the learning curve today â€™ s cam user can easily generate streamlined tool paths , optimized tool axis tilt for higher feed rates , better tool life and surface finish , and ideal cutting depth in addition to programming cutting operations , modern cam softwares can additionally drive non-cutting operations such as machine tool probing each of which is implemented by a variety of basic and sophisticated strategies , depending on the part design , material , and software available this takes the best advantage of the machine 's ability by cutting material horizontally a light chip load at high feed and rpm is often referred to as high speed machining ( hsm ) , and can provide quick machining times with high quality results
