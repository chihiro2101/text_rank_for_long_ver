the first part of the story is told through a series of flashbacks when frank is unconscious under a full anaesthetic in a dentist â€™ s chair , having had his front teeth broken in a rugby match although at first somewhat uncoordinated at the sport , he impresses the team 's owner , gerald weaver ( badel ) , with the spirit and brutality of his playing style during the trial off the field , frank is much less successful frank desires her sexually and one day grabs her and forces her onto his bed she sometimes insults him , referring to him as '' just a great ape '' , and on their first proper date at a smart restaurant frank insults the staff and protocol because he feels out of his depth she says , on another occasion that their neighbours think she is a slut and she and the children are not 'proper people ' because of him he wants another job , 'something permanent ' the doctor says she does not have the strength or perhaps even the will to survive he calls her name and briefly hangs from a lintel by one arm , like an ape might this was anderson 's first feature film as director , although he had won an oscar for his short documentary thursday 's children ( 1954 ) , one of the documentaries he had made in the previous decade the project had first been discussed by the rank organisation as a possible project for joseph losey and then karel reisz who , reluctant to direct another film with a similar setting and theme to saturday night and sunday morning ( 1960 ) suggested that lindsay anderson direct it with himself serving as producer the film also features arthur lowe , later to star in dad 's army , who appeared in four later films directed by anderson anderson wrote in his diary on 23 april 1962 , after the first month or so of production , '' the most striking feature of it all , i suppose , has been the splendour and misery of my work and relationship with richard '' he felt that harris was acting better than ever before in his career , but feared his feelings for harris , whose combination of physicality , affection and cruelty fascinated him , meant that he lacked the detachment he needed as a director john russell taylor in 1980 thought it a mistake to link this sporting life with the '' kitchen sink '' films released in the preceding few years , because its '' emotionalism '' made it '' unique '' , apart from anderson 's other work on 22 january 2008 , the film was released as a region 1 dvd by the criterion collection
