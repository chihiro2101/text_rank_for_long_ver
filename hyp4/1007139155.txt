the name barère de vieuzac , by which he continued to call himself long after the abolition of feudalism in france , originated from a small fief belonging to his father , jean barère , who was a lawyer at vieuzac ( now argelès-gazost ) bertrand barère cite note-3 3 jean-pierre would later earn a spot in the council of five hundred alongside the very men who discarded any notion of accepting bertrand barére as a member '' in 1789 , he was elected deputy by the estates of bigorre to the estates-general – he had made his first visit to paris in the preceding year barère de vieuzac at first belonged to the constitutional party , but he was less known as a speaker in the national constituent assembly than as a journalist bertrand barère cite note-7 7 he voted with the mountain for the king 's execution '' without appeal and without delay , '' and closed his speech with : '' the tree of liberty grows only when watered by the blood of tyrants who was unaligned with either the mountain or the girondins , he was the first member elected to the committee of public safety and one of two members ( with robert lindet ) , who served on it during its entire existence of 923 orders signed by the committee of public safety in the fall of 1793 , barère was the author or first signatory on 244 , the second most behind carnot , with the majority of his orders dealing with police activities palmer ( 1949 ) analyzed that 'his commitment to the revolution rather than any distinct faction separated him from other major revolutionary figures' 242 , 14 july 1793 ) to attack barère directly : '' there is one whom i regard as the most dangerous enemy of the nation : i mean barère i 'm convinced that he plays both sides of every issue until he sees which one is coming out ahead the ‘ federalist ’ uprisings , the committee of public safety , the assassination of marat , the enragés and the popular movement , the general maximum on 5 september 1793 barère incited the french national convention with a speech glorifying terror and the founding of revolutionary armies by sans-culottes : '' the aristocrats of internal affairs are since many days meditating a movement oh well ! they 'll have it , that movement , but they 'll have it against them ! it will be organized , regularized by a revolutionary army that at last will fulfil that great word that it owes to the paris commune : let 's make terror the order of the day ! '' noah shusterman – the french revolution 161 he changed opinion when the hébertists called for another revolution in march 1794 ; the voluntary guards and militant sans-culottes lost influence quickly in summer he was one of the leading men in the power struggles between the mountain and the plain , involved in the downfall of robespierre barère mainly focused on four aspects about '' la religion de la patrie '' – the belief that a citizen would be consecrated to the fatherland at birth , the citizen should then come to love the fatherland , the republic would teach the people virtues , and the fatherland would be the teacher to all barère went on to state that '' the republic leaves the guidance of your first years to your parents , but as soon as your intelligence is developed , it proudly claims the rights that it holds over you '' he pushed for freedom of press , speech , and thought bertrand barère cite note-12 12 barère also stated that one could serve the nation by giving his labor , wealth , counsel , strength , and/or blood another clique on the committee , consisting of robespierre , couthon , and saint-just believed in their own vision of the direction of the revolution in his memoirs written years later about this time , barère described the committee of public safety of having at least three factions : the '' experts '' consisting of lazare carnot , robert lindet , and pierre louis prieur ; the '' high-hands '' consisting of robespierre , couthon , and saint-just ; and the '' true revolutionaries '' consisting of billaud-varenne , collot , and barère himself at the same time , the committee of general security , nominally the police committee of the national convention , had seen its place superseded by the law of 22 prairial , leaving members like marc-guillaume alexis vadier and jean-pierre-andré amar concerned for their status these decrees , a program of property confiscation that had seen little support in the previous four months , was received with cautious optimism by couthon and saint-just however , the following day , at a joint meeting of the committees , robespierre once again proclaimed his dedication to purging the committees of potential , though unnamed , enemies robespierre continued down this path until 8 thermidor , when he gave a famous oration alluding to multiple threats within the national convention 175–176 however , to his surprise , robespierre was pushed for more evidence by members of the committee of general security this led to a fierce debate and a lack of support from the deputies of the plain , both of which robespierre was not used to 842 after being ejected from the jacobin club that night , collot and billaud-varenne returned to the committee of public safety to find saint-just at work on a speech for the next day though barère had been pushing saint-just to give a speech regarding the new unity of the committees , both collot and billaud-varenne assumed he was working on their final denunciation this led to the final fracturing of the committee of public safety , and a heated argument ensued , in which barère allegedly insulted couthon , saint-just and robespierre , saying : : '' who are you then , insolent pygmies , that you want to divide the remains of our country between a cripple , a child and a scoundrel ? i would n't give you a farmyard to govern ! '' palmer , 1949 , p a possibly apocryphal tale held that as barère rose to speak he held two speeches in his pocket : one for robespierre and one against him here barère played his role in 9 thermidor , by submitting a bill that would blunt the ability of the paris commune to be used as a military force meanwhile the political developments in paris resulted in the decision to put him on trial again barère escaped on 4 brumaire iv ( 26 october 1795 ) , with the help also of a local man named eutrope vanderkand in early 1798 ( while still in hiding ) , he was elected to the directory 's council of five hundred from his native hautes-pyrénées , but he was not allowed to take his seat in april of 1799 , the directory issues an order for his arrest , so he leaves bordeaux and hides out in saint-ouen-sur-seine near paris on 24 december 1799 , napoleon issued an amnesty for some politicians of both the right and the left , including barère
