government initiated a displacement of the existing societies living east of the mississippi river , including the five tribes , to lands west of the river this federally legislated displacement initiative , dubbed the indian removal , forced a significant number of the five tribes to indian territory in other parts of the north american continent over several decades , many to what later became oklahoma territory thumb during the american civil war , the politics of the five tribes were divergent once the tribes had been relocated to indian territory , the united states government promised that their lands would be free of white settlement relative to other states , all five tribes are represented in significant numbers in the population of oklahoma today in addition , there are numerous cherokee heritage groups throughout the united states , such as the satellite communities sponsored by the cherokee nation all historical records indicate the chickasaw lived in northeastern mississippi from the first european contact until they were forced to remove to oklahoma , where most now live the chickasaws were one of the '' five civilized tribes '' who went to the indian territory during the era of indian removal there were about 20,000 members of this tribe when they were forced to move to indian territory this tribe was predominantly farmers ( like most indians were at the time ) until they were removed from their land they have grown substantially since the trail of tears and there are currently about 231,000 members , making the choctaw the third largest native american population in the united states starting in 1836 , the american government forced them to travel west of the mississippi along with the other civilized tribes to '' indian territory '' the seminole nation came into existence in the 18th century and was composed of renegade and outcast native americans from georgia , mississippi , and alabama , most significantly the creek people , as well as african americans who escaped from slavery in south carolina and georgia for about twenty years after the move to indian territory ( oklahoma ) , the seminoles refused to live with the muscogee creek tribe or under their government until they finally reached an agreement with the government to sign a treaty and live with them the term '' civilized '' has historically been used to distinguish the five tribes from other native american groups that were formerly often referred to as '' wild '' or '' savage '' while the term '' five civilized tribes '' has been institutionalized in federal government policy to the point that the us congress passed laws using the name , the five nations themselves have been less accepting of it in formal matters , and some members have declared that grouping the different peoples under this label is effectively another form of colonization and control by white society former indian reservations in oklahoma cultural assimilation of native americans civilization fund act praying indians mission indians kill the indian , save the man five civilized tribes museum five civilized tribes trail of tears indian removal act
