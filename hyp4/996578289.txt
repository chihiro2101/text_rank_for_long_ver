marble also has the advantage that , when first quarried , it is relatively soft and easy to work , refine , and polish preference to the cheaper and less translucent limestone is based largely on the fineness of marble 's grain , which enables the sculptor to render minute detail in a manner not always possible with limestone for severe environments , granite is a more lasting material but one which is far more difficult to work and much less suitable for refined works a suitable tool for this task is a point chisel , which is a long , hefty piece of steel with a point at one end and a broad striking surface at the other a pitching tool may also be used at this early stage , which is a wedge-shaped chisel with a broad , flat edge some artists prefer to carve directly onto the stone , without a model ; the renaissance artist michelangelo , for example , claimed that his job was to free the human form trapped inside the block an artist might mark out specific lines by using calipers to measure an area of stone to be addressed and marking the removal area with pencil , charcoal or chalk tools called rasps and rifflers are then used to enhance the shape into its final form the sculptor uses broad , sweeping strokes to remove excess stone as small chips or dust regardless of the method , however , a glossy marble sculpture will appear more translucent than one that has not been polished the italian terms for the basic carving tools of stone sculpture are given here , and where possible the english terms have been included il martello pneumatico – jackhammer il flessibile – an angle grinder , fitted with an electrolysis-applied diamond studded blade hand drill in addition to those hand tools listed above , the marble sculptor uses a variety of hammers – both for the striking of edge tools ( chisels and hand drills ) and for striking the stone directly ( bocciarda a martello in italian , boucharde in french , bush hammer in english ) this way , one can drive the point deeper into the stone and remove more material at a time some stoneworkers also spin the subbia in their fingers between hammer blows , thus applying with each blow a different part of the point to the stone
