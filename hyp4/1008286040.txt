from most to least protective , as generally accepted by riders and manufacturers , the helmet types are : many full face helmets include vents to increase the airflow to the rider studies have shown that full face helmets offer the most protection to motorcycle riders because 35 % of all crashes showed major impact on the chin-bar area thumb the motocross and off-road helmet has clearly elongated chin and visor portions , a chin bar , and partially open face to give the rider extra protection while wearing goggles and to allow the unhindered flow of air during the physical exertion typical of this type of riding modern off-road helmets include a ( typically angular , rather than round ) chin bar to provide some facial impact protection in addition to protection from flying dirt and debris when properly combined with goggles , the result provides most of the same protective features of full face street helmets thumb a hybrid between full face and open face helmets for street use is the modular or '' flip-up '' helmet , also sometimes termed '' convertible '' or '' flip-face '' when fully assembled and closed , they resemble full face helmets by bearing a chin bar for absorbing face impacts its chin bar may be pivoted upwards ( or , in some cases , may be removed ) by a special lever to allow access to most of the face , as in an open face helmet the rider may thus eat , drink or have a conversation without unfastening the chinstrap and removing the helmet , making them popular among motor officers it is also popular with people who use eyeglasses as it allows them to fit a helmet without removing their glasses the curved shape of an open chin bar and face shield section can cause increased wind drag during riding , as air will not flow around an open modular helmet in the same way as a three-quarters helmet the chin bar of those helmets offer real protection and they can be used in the '' open '' position while riding observation and unofficial testing suggest that significantly greater protection exists beyond that for an open face helmet , and may be enough to pass full-face helmet standardized tests , but the extent of protection is not fully established by all standards bodies ece 22.05 allows certification of modular helmets with or without chin bar tests , distinguished by -p ( protective lower face cover ) and -np ( non-protective ) suffixes to the certification number , and additional warning text for non-certified chin bars an open face helmet provides the same rear protection as a full face helmet , but little protection to the face , even from non-crash events alternatively , many open face helmets include , or can be fitted with , a face shield , which is more effective in stopping flying insects from entering the helmet riders wearing a plain white helmet rather than a black one were associated with a 24 % lower risk of suffering a motorcycle accident injury or death this study also notes '' riders wearing high visibility clothing and white helmets are likely to be more safety conscious than other riders '' abstract , quick summary conversely , another study , the maids report , did not back up the claims that helmet color makes any difference in accident frequency , and that in fact motorcycles painted white were actually over-represented in the accident sample compared to the exposure data while recognizing how much riders need to be seen , the maids report documented that riders ' clothing usually fails to do so , saying that '' in 65.3 % of all cases , the clothing made no contribution to the conspicuity of the rider or the ptw powered two-wheeler , i.e motorcycle helmets are generally designed to distort in a crash ( thus expending the energy otherwise destined for the wearer 's skull ) , so they provide little protection at the site of their first impact , but continued protection over the remainder of the helmet however , using these materials can be very expensive , and manufacturers will balance factors such as protection , comfort , weight , and additional features to meet target price points the common perception that a helmet 's purpose is to save the rider 's head from splitting open is misleading many countries have set standards for the effectiveness of a motorcycle helmet , including the following drag racing , bicycling , horseback riding ) , and many riders in north america consider snell certification a benefit when considering buying a helmet while others note that its standards allow for more force ( g 's ) to be transferred to a rider 's head than the u.s the standard also describes how helmets must be labeled , including with such information as how to wear and clean the helmet , its size and mass , and warnings to replace the helmet after a violent impact helmets must also carry a type approval mark of the form '' eaa 05bbbb/c-dddd '' since there is a wide range of severity in the impacts that could happen in a motorcycle accident , some will be more severe than the impacts used in the standard tests and some will be less .
