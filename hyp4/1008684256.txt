one road led north towards nacogdoches , the other went to harrisburgh without orders from houston and with no discussion amongst themselves , the troops in the lead took the road to harrisburgh they arrived on april 18 , not long after the mexican army 's departure that same day , deaf smith and henry karnes captured a mexican courier carrying intelligence on the locations and future plans of all of the mexican troops in texas out of concern that his men might not differentiate between mexican soldiers and the tejanos in seguín 's company , houston originally ordered seguín and his men to remain in harrisburgh to guard those who were too ill to travel quickly houston 's army , comprising 900 men , reached lynch 's ferry mid-morning on april 20 ; santa anna 's 700-man force arrived a few hours later the texians made camp in a wooded area along the bank of buffalo bayou ; while the location provided good cover and helped hide their full strength , it also left the texians no room for retreat over the protests of several of his officers , santa anna chose to make camp in a vulnerable location , a plain near the san jacinto river , bordered by woods on one side , marsh and lake on another houston was irate that the infantry had disobeyed his orders and given santa anna a better estimate of their strength ; the men were equally upset that houston had not allowed a full battle at on april 21 , cos arrived with 540 reinforcements , bringing the mexican force to approximately 1,200-1,500 men which outnumbered the texian aggregate forces of approximately 800 men ( official count entering battle was reported at 783 ) houston , 1836 , op cit general cos ' men were mostly raw recruits rather than experienced soldiers , and they had marched steadily for more than 24 hours with no rest and no food by afternoon , santa anna had given permission for cos ' men to sleep ; his own tired troops also took advantage of the time to rest , eat , and bathe not long after cos arrived with reinforcements , general houston ordered smith to destroy vince 's bridge ( located about 8 miles from the texian encampment ) to block the only road out of the brazos and , thereby , prevent any possibility of escape by santa anna '' houston , texian army hq report from san jacinto , 1836 , op cit the texian cavalry was first dispatched to the mexican forces ' far left , and the artillery advanced through the tall grass to within 200 yards of the mexican breastworks in what historian davis calls '' one of the most one-sided victories in history '' , davis ( 2006 ) , p although santa anna 's troops had been thoroughly vanquished , they did not represent the bulk of the mexican army in texas texians had won the battle because of mistakes made by santa anna , and houston was well aware that his troops would have little hope of repeating their victory against urrea or filisola as darkness fell , a large group of prisoners was led into camp lamar thought houston was deliberately shot by one of his own men bargaining for his life , santa anna suggested that he order the remaining mexican troops to stay away in a letter to filisola , who was now the senior mexican official in texas , santa anna wrote that '' yesterday evening we had an unfortunate encounter '' and ordered his troops to retreat to béxar and await further instructions according to hardin , '' santa anna had presented mexico with one military disaster ; filisola did not wish to risk another filisola later wrote that '' had the enemy met us under these cruel circumstances , on the only road that was left , no alternative remained but to die or surrender at discretion '' santa anna suggested two treaties , a public version of promises made between the two countries , and a private version that included santa anna 's personal agreements prisoners of war would be released unharmed , and santa anna would be given immediate passage to veracruz when urrea began marching south in mid-may , many families from san patricio who had supported the mexican army went with him when texian troops arrived in early june , they found only 20 families remaining many former slaves followed the army to mexico , where they could be free filisola fully expected that the defeat was temporary and that a second campaign would be launched to retake texas when mexican authorities received word of santa anna 's defeat at san jacinto , flags across the country were lowered to half staff and draped in mourning most in texas assumed the mexican army would return quickly new american settlers moved in and used threats and legal maneuvering to take over the land once owned by tejanos new mexico , sonora , and california revolted unsuccessfully ;
