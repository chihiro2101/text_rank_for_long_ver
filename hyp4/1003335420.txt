there are many professional programs such as medical and dental school require a previous bachelors for admission and are considered graduate or graduate entry programs even though they culminate in a bachelor 's degree generally , however , a student is not required to take taught modules as part of their candidacy in such cases , an alternative degree will be awarded for their previous work , usually an m.phil generally , in order to be accepted , the candidate must have above average grades and it is highly recommended to be initiated on scientific research through government programs on undergraduate areas , as a complement to usual coursework some colleges may provide english language upgrading to students prior to the start of their graduate certificate program admission to a master 's ( course-based , also called '' non-thesis '' ) program generally requires a bachelor 's degree in a related field , with sufficiently high grades usually ranging from b+ and higher ( note that different schools have different letter grade conventions , and this requirement may be significantly higher in some faculties ) , and recommendations from professors admission to a high-quality thesis-type master 's program generally requires an honours degree or canadian honours degree , samples of the student 's writing as well as a research thesis proposal admission to a doctoral program generally requires a thesis-type master 's degree in a related field , sufficiently high grades , recommendations , samples of writing , a research proposal , and typically an interview with a prospective supervisor requirements are often set higher than those for a master 's program in exceptional cases , a student holding an honours bachelor or canadian bachelor with honours with sufficiently high grades and proven writing and research abilities may be admitted directly to a ph.d many canadian graduate programs allow students who start in a master 's to '' reclassify '' into a ph.d graduate students must usually declare their research goal or submit a research proposal upon entering grad school ; in the case of master 's degrees , there will be some flexibility ( that is , one is not held to one 's research proposal , although major changes , for example from premodern to modern history , are discouraged ) graduate students may take out student loans , but instead they often work as teaching or research assistants funding is available to first-year masters students whose transcripts reflect exceptionally high grades ; this funding is normally given in the second year both master 's and doctoral programs may be done by coursework or research or a combination of the two , depending on the subject and faculty germany and the netherlands introduced the bologna process with a separation between bachelor and master programmes in many fields , except for education studies , law and other specially regulated subjects funding for postgraduate study in the uk is awarded competitively , and usually is disseminated by institution ( in the form of a certain allocation of studentships for a given year ) rather than directly to individuals there are a number of scholarships for master 's courses , but these are relatively rare and dependent on the course and class of undergraduate degree obtained ( usually requiring at least a lower second ) the master 's component of a doctorate program often requires one or two years , and some students , because doctoral programs are sometimes better-funded , apply for doctoral programs while only intending to earn a master 's degree many graduate programs require students to pass one or several examinations in order to demonstrate their competence as scholars in some departments , a comprehensive examination is often required in the first year of doctoral study , and is designed to test a student 's background undergraduate-level knowledge however , many us master 's degree programs do not require a master 's thesis , focusing instead primarily on course work or on '' practicals '' or '' workshops '' such '' real-world '' experience may typically require a candidate work on a project alone or in a team as a consultant , or consultants , for an outside entity approved or selected by the academic institution , and under faculty supervision in the second and third years of study , doctoral programs often require students to pass more examinations '' for some social science and many humanities disciplines , where graduate students may or may not have studied the discipline at the undergraduate level , these exams will be the first set , and be based either on graduate coursework or specific preparatory reading ( sometimes up to a year 's work in reading ) passing such examinations allows the student to stay , begin doctoral research , and rise to the status of a doctoral candidate while failing usually results in the student leaving the program or re-taking the test after some time has passed ( usually a semester or a year ) some schools have an intermediate category , passing at the master 's level , which allows the student to leave with a master 's without having completed a master 's thesis in total , the typical doctoral degree takes between four and eight years from entering the program to completion though this time varies depending upon the department , thesis topic , and many other factors though there is substantial variation among universities , departments , and individuals , humanities and social science doctorates on average take somewhat longer to complete than natural science doctorates however , time required to complete a doctorate also varies according to the candidate 's abilities and choice of research traditionally , doctoral programs were only intended to last three to four years and , in some disciplines ( primarily the natural sciences ) , with a helpful advisor , and a light teaching load , it is possible for the degree to be completed in that amount of time however , increasingly many disciplines , including most humanities , set their requirements for coursework , languages and the expected extent of thesis research by the assumption that students will take five years minimum or six to seven years on average ; competition for jobs within these fields also raises expectations on the length and quality of theses considerably degree is a second professional degree , which includes two years of study and one to two years of research and a project in the candidates local area of work in some fields , research positions are more coveted than teaching positions because student researchers are typically paid to work on the dissertation they are required to complete anyway , while teaching is generally considered a distraction from one 's work funding differs greatly by departments and universities ; some universities give five years of full funding to all ph.d students , though often with a teaching requirement attached ; other universities do not
