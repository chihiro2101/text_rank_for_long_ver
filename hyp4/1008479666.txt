chicago studies in ethnomusicology , university of chicago press , 1990 one of the earliest forms of the hurdy-gurdy was the organistrum , a large instrument with a guitar-shaped body and a long neck in which the keys were set ( covering one diatonic octave ) the organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings , which ran over a common bridge , and a relatively small wheel the solo organistrum was known from spain and france , but was largely replaced by the symphonia , a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard by the end of the 17th century changing musical tastes demanded greater polyphonic capabilities than the hurdy-gurdy could offer and pushed the instrument to the lowest social classes ; as a result it acquired names like the german bauernleier 'peasant 's lyre ' and bettlerleier 'beggar 's lyre ' a person who plays the hurdy-gurdy is called a hurdy-gurdist , or ( particularly for players of french instruments ) viellist because of the prominence of the french tradition , many instrument and performance terms used in english are commonly taken from the french , and players generally need to know these terms to read relevant literature according to the oxford english dictionary , the mid 18th century origin of the term hurdy-gurdy is onomatopoeia in origin , after the repetitive warble in pitch that characterizes instruments with solid wooden wheels that have warped due to changes in humidity or after the sound of the buzzing-bridge the instrument is sometimes more descriptively called a wheel fiddle in english , but this term is rarely used among players of the instrument 31 , 1931 ) in france , the instrument is known as vielle à roue ( wheel fiddle ) or simply vielle ( even though there is another instrument with this name ) , while in the french-speaking regions of belgium it is also known in local dialects as vièrlerète/vièrlète or tiesse di dj'va ( 'horse 's head ' ) another hungarian name for the instrument is nyenyere , which is thought to be an onomatopoeic reference to the repetitive warble produced by a wheel that is not even leier , lant , and related terms today are generally used to refer to members of the lute or lyre family , but historically had a broader range of meaning and were used for many types of stringed instruments in her overview of the instrument 's history , palmer recorded twenty-three different forms , and there is still no standardized design today a number of regional forms developed , but outside france the instrument was considered a folk instrument and there were no schools of construction that could have determined a standard form there are two primary body styles for contemporary instruments : guitar-bodied and lute-backed the box form of the simphonia is also commonly found among players of early music and historical re-enactors historically , strings were made of gut , which is still a preferred material today and modern instruments are mounted with violin ( d or a ) and cello ( a , g , c ) strings however , metal strings have become common in the twentieth century , especially for the heavier drone strings or for lower melody strings if octave tuning is used the melody string ( s ) ( french chanterelle ( s ) , hungarian dallamhúr ( ok ) ) are stopped with tangents attached to keys that change the vibration length of the string , much as a guitarist uses his or her fingers on the fretboard of a guitar in addition , individual strings ( in particular the melody strings ) often have to have their height above the wheel surface adjusted by having small pieces of paper placed between the strings and the bridge , a process called shimming shimming and cottoning are connected processes since either one can affect the geometry of the instrument 's strings when the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string ( called the trompette on french instruments ) holds the bridge in place , sounding a drone there are various stylistic techniques that are used as the player turns the crank , striking the wheel at various points in its revolution the percussion is transmitted to the wheel by striking the handle with the thumb , fingers or base of the thumb at one or more of four points in the revolution of the wheel ( often described in terms of the clock face , 12 , 3 , 6 and 9 o'clock ) to achieve the desired rhythm in traditional tekerő playing , the buzzing bridge is controlled entirely by the wrist of the player and has a very different sound and rhythmic possibilities from those available on french instruments regional types of hurdy-gurdies since the renaissance can also be classified based on wheel size and the presence or absence ( and type ) of a buzzing bridge because of the small size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings : one melody string , one tenor drone and one bass drone the type of buzzing bridge found on this instrument usually has the adjustment peg set in a block next to the string , rather than in the tailpiece ( as is typical of french instruments ) usually two drones ( sometimes three ) + one or two chromatic melody strings some modern instruments have as many as fifteen strings played by the wheel , although the most common number is six usually four drones + two melody strings , but often extended to have more strings french instruments generally have a narrow key box with drone strings that run on the outside of the key box traditional french instruments have two melody strings and four drone strings with one buzzing bridge this instrument also has three trompette strings two forms : one has a standard drone-melody arrangement , while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox two forms : one has a standard drone-melody arrangement , while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox
