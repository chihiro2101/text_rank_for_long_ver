quite often there are no teams at all ; the players take turns at batting and there is often no emphasis on actually scoring runs tennis balls are often used due to the fact that they are less likely to inflict injuries than a cricket ball often a tennis ball will be heavily taped on one side to give the ball extra 'swing ' a completely taped tennis ball is very popular for street cricket in pakistan as the electric tape makes the ball heavier and less bouncy as compared to a normal tennis ball but it is still relatively harmless as compared to a real cricket ball often , the wicket is by no means close to the official size , but it is used anyway a wicket at the non-striker 's end is generally a single stump if proper stumps are available and in the absence of larger objects may be just a hat or a shoe however a list of the typical rules which are used most of the time are as follows : no ducks – a batsman can not be given out without scoring – they always get another go until they 've scored 1+ runs first/trial ball rule : ( a stricter alternative to no ducks ) a batter can not be given out on the first ball they face ( known as trial ball in the subcontinent ) ways of getting out one hand , one bounce – if the batsman has hit the ball into the ground , but it has only bounced once , they can still be given out caught , but only if the fielder catches the ball with one hand ; even if the hand hits the ground ( keeping in mind dust on back of palm ) the player is out when the fielding team member catches the ball after one bounce , but in one hand , the player who hit the ball is out ! '' one hand , one bounce , one beer – an alternate to the one hand , one bounce rule where the fielder must also be in possession of a beverage ( traditionally a beer ) in order to enact the rule and get the batsman out any balls making contact with the auto wickie without bouncing , or '' on the full '' , is considered out running to score runs hit and run — ( also known as tip and run ) like in baseball , if the batsman 's bat makes contact with the ball they must run i ) the 'current ' rule : in order to effect a run out , the bowler/fielder can put one foot on the stumps when the ball is thrown to him however , he is allowed to bat on both side of the team he is allowed to bat at any order , but depending on two captain agreement he can be restricted to bat last , which is after all team player gets out if one side of the captain shares dodger nature , he may say you get to pick your player first and i will bat first bats are usually tossed ( see bat flip cricket , calls are made for the hill/rooftop or flat side in beach cricket the creases and the boundary are normally drawn in the sand in a line which extends well past the side of the agreed pitch to prevent them becoming obliterated in the first over sometimes , play is shifted along the beach to a new pitch as the packed sand of the original pitch is turned up , thus reducing the standard of or even completely disabling bowling
