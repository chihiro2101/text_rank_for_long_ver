most subsequent migration from north to south china passed through the valleys of the xiang and gan rivers to the west , so that min varieties have experienced less northern influence than other southern groups linguists estimate that the oldest layers of min dialects diverged from the rest of chinese around the time of the han dynasty : min is usually described as one of seven or ten groups of varieties of chinese but has greater dialectal diversity than any of the other groups li rulong and chen zhangtai examined 214 words , finding 62 % shared with quanzhou dialect ( southern min ) and 39 % shared with fuzhou dialect ( eastern min ) , and concluded that pu-xian was more closely related to southern min in popular usage , southern min usually refers to dialects of the hokkien type , which originated in southern fujian ( around quanzhou , zhangzhou and xiamen ) and spread to southeast asia , where they are known as hokkien , and taiwan , where they are known as taiwanese pan and colleagues divided the inland varieties into two groups : northern min ( min bei ) is spoken in nanping prefecture in fujian , with jian'ou dialect taken as typical the language atlas of china ( 1987 ) included a further group : shao-jiang min , spoken in the northwestern fujian counties of shaowu and jiangle , were classified as hakka by pan and his associates however , jerry norman suggested that they were inland varieties of min that had been subject to heavy gan or hakka influence most min vocabulary corresponds directly to cognates in other chinese varieties , but there is also a significant number of distinctively min words that may be traced back to proto-min in min this form has displaced the common chinese term tián 田 many scholars identify the min word with chéng 塍 ( mc zying ) '' raised path between fields '' , but norman argues that it is cognate with céng 層 ( mc dzong ) '' additional layer or floor '' , reflecting the terraced fields commonly found in fujian in min this form has displaced the common chinese term kǒu 口 moreover , the austroasiatic predecessor of modern vietnamese language has been proven to originate in the mountainous region in central laos and vietnam , rather than in the region north of the red river delta given that min combines the chinese of several different periods and contains some non-chinese substrate vocabulary , an author literate in mandarin ( or even classical chinese ) may have trouble finding the appropriate chinese characters for some min vocabulary in the case of taiwanese , there are also indigenous words borrowed from formosan languages ( particularly for place names ) , as well as a substantial number of loan words from japanese the min spoken in singapore and malaysia has borrowed heavily from malay and , to a lesser extent , from english and other languages
