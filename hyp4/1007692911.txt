the story of galahad and his quest for the holy grail is a relatively late addition to the arthurian legend the original conception of galahad , whose adult exploits are first recounted in the fourth book of the vulgate cycle , may had come from the mystical cistercian order in the french tale used by thomas malory , king pelles has already received magical foreknowledge that lancelot will give his daughter a child and that this little boy will grow to become the greatest knight in the world , the knight chosen by god to discover the holy grail destiny will have to be helped along a little ; therefore , a conclusion which prompts pelles to seek out '' one of the greatest enchantresses of the time , '' dame brusen , who gives pelles a magic ring that makes elaine take on the appearance of guinevere and enables her to spend a night with lancelot on discovering the deception , lancelot draws his sword on elaine , but when he finds out that they have conceived a son together , he is immediately forgiving ; however , he does not marry elaine or even wish to be with her any more and returns to arthur 's court according to the 13th-century old french prose lancelot ( part of the vulgate cycle ) , '' galahad '' ( galaad ) was lancelot 's original name , but it was changed when he was a child at his birth , therefore , galahad is given his father 's own original name galahad survives this test , witnessed by arthur who , upon realising the greatness of this new knight , leads him out to the river where a magic sword lies in a stone with an inscription reading '' never shall man take me hence but only he by whose side i ought to hang ; and he shall be the best knight of the world galahad is promptly invited to become a knight of the round table , and soon afterwards , arthur 's court witnesses an ethereal vision of the grail arthur is sorrowful that all the knights have embarked thus , for he discerns that many will never be seen again , dying in their quest galahad , in some ways , mirrors arthur , drawing a sword from a stone in the way that arthur did after many adventures , galahad and percival find themselves in the mystical castle of corbenic at the court of pelles and eliazar , his son after seeing the grail , galahad , however , makes the request that he may die at the time of his choosing so it is , while making his way back to arthur 's court , galahad is visited by joseph of arimathea , and thus experiences such glorious rapture that he makes his request to die galahad 's success in the high religious endeavour that was the search for the holy grail was predicted before his birth , not only by pelles but also by merlin , who once had told uther pendragon that there was one who would fill the place at the '' table of joseph '' , but that he was not yet born despite this , galahad is the knight who is chosen to find the holy grail galahad , in both the lancelot-grail cycle and in malory 's retelling , is exalted above all the other knights : he is the one worthy enough to have the holy grail revealed to him and to be taken into heaven according to the legend , only pure knights may achieve the grail this quality is reflected in alfred , lord tennyson 's poem '' sir galahad '' : my good blade carves the casques of men , / my tough lance thrusteth sure , / my strength is as the strength of ten , / because my heart is pure in the next verse of this poem , tennyson continues to glorify galahad for remaining pure at heart , by putting these words into his mouth : i never felt the kiss of love , / nor maiden 's hand in mine '' tennyson 's poem follows galahad 's journey to find the holy grail but ends while he is still riding , still seeking , still dreaming ; as if to say that the quest for the holy grail is an ongoing task unlike many other portrayals of the legend of sir galahad , tennyson has sir galahad speak in the first person , gives the reader his thoughts and feelings as he rides on his quest , rather than just the details of his battles , as in malory sir galahad 's thoughts and aspirations have been explored as well by william morris in his poems the chapel in lyoness , published in 1856 , and sir galahad , a christmas mystery , sir galahad , a christmas mystery camelot project published in 1858 in a christmas mystery , written more than twenty years after tennyson 's sir galahad , galahad is '' fighting an internal battle between the ideal and the human , '' and tries to reconcile his longing for earthly delights , such as the romantic exploits of sir palomydes and his father sir lancelot , and the '' more austere spiritual goal to which he has been called '' in the companion piece the chapel in lyoness , a knight lies dying in winter '' in a bizarre realization of galahad 's nightmare vision of his own fate '' a poem by thomas de beverly published in 1925 , '' the birth of sir galahad '' , tells of the events leading up to the conception of sir galahad , his birth and a visit soon afterwards by sir bors , to see elaine and the baby galahad camelot project this is similar to god declaring that king david had shed much blood and was not worthy of building the jerusalem temple , this honour falling only to his son king solomon in john erskine 's novel galahad : enough of his life to explain his reputation , galahad 's main tutor for his knightly training is queen guinevere cohen pokes fun at galahad 's '' calling '' by saying that his life would be wasted if he failed to remain pure and holy in order to be the bearer of the holy grail berger shows that even though galahad is in fact the greatest knight in the world , he does not appear to be in most versions of the story of sir galahad , galahad 's death comes about after his greatest achievement , that of the holy grail johnny cash speaks as god , describing the pilgrim as a just and faithful knight , before singing the final line of the album in the 1998 miniseries merlin , the title character meets galahad and his parents while looking for a suitable regent for camelot while arthur searches for the grail in the 2015 video game the order : 1886 , the main character is an heir to the title of sir galahad , and is therefore referred to as such a comical approach to the legend of sir galahad , his quest for the holy grail , and his pure character is made to seem foolish this poem gives details regarding how elaine , daughter of king pellas , receives a magic ring that will trick lancelot into sleeping with her and conceiving galahad follows the story of galahad 's conception and his whole life shows how galahad is depicted in william morris ’ “ sir galahad , a christmas mystery ” this text gives a detailed discourse covering galahad 's life story from his birth to his death , with specific emphasis on his contribution to the quest for the holy grail
