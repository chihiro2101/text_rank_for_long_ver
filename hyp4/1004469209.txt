this dominance led to wealth in the form of tribute , and kent was a powerful kingdom at the time of æthelberht 's death in 616 , with trade well-established with the europe augustine landed in eastern kent , and soon managed to convert æthelberht , who gave augustine land in canterbury an important source for this period in kentish history is the ecclesiastical history of the english people , written in 731 by bede , a benedictine monk from northumbria bede was primarily interested in the christianization of england , but he also provides substantial information about secular history , including the reigns of æthelberht and eadbald barbara yorke , kent , kings of , oxford online dictionary of national biography , 2004 it is known that æthelberht married twice as eadbald married his step-mother after his father 's death , to the consternation of the church æthelburg married edwin , king of northumbria , one of the dominant anglo-saxon kings of the seventh century it is possible that there was another brother , named æthelwald : the evidence for this is a papal letter to justus , archbishop of canterbury from 619 to 625 , in which a king named aduluald is referred to , and who is apparently different from audubald , which refers to eadbald there is no agreement among modern scholars on how to interpret this : '' aduluald '' might be intended as a representation of '' æthelwald '' , and hence this may be an indication of another king , perhaps a subking of west kent ; yorke , kings and kingdoms , pp he then remarried , and his second wife , according to kentish tradition recorded in the 'kentish royal legend ' , was a woman named ymme of frankish royal blood , though recently it has been suggested that she may have instead been the daughter of erchinoald , mayor of the palace in neustria , the western part of francia the surviving regnal lists show only one king reigning at a time in kent , but subkingdoms were common among the anglo-saxons and from the reign of hlothhere , in the late seventh century , there is evidence that kent was usually ruled by two kings , though often one is clearly dominant forged charters preserve a tradition of eadbald ruling during his father 's reign , presumably as a subking over west kent the papal letter that has been interpreted as indicating the existence of æthelwald , a brother of eadbald 's , refers to æthelwald as a king ; if he existed , he would presumably have been a junior king to eadbald although æthelberht had been christian since about 600 and his wife bertha was also christian , eadbald was a pagan sæberht , the king of essex , had become a christian under æthelberht 's influence , but on sæberht 's death , at about the same time , his sons expelled mellitus , the bishop of london eadbald 's second wife , ymme , was a frank , and it is possible that kent 's strong connections with francia were a factor in the king 's conversion in the 620s , eadbald 's sister æthelburg came to kent , but sent her children to the court of king dagobert i in francia ; in addition to the diplomatic connections , trade with the franks was important to kent 624 : after justus 's succession , pope boniface writes to him to say that he has heard in letters from king aduluald ( possibly a scribal error for eadbald ) of the king 's conversion to christianity the pallium accompanying that letter indicates justus was archbishop by that time , and the duration of mellitus 's archiepiscopate means that even if bede 's dates are somewhat wrong in other particulars , eadbald was converted no earlier than 621 , and no later than april 624 , since mellitus consecrated a church for eadbald before his death in that month as mentioned above , it has been suggested that king '' aduluald '' in the letter to justus is a real king æthelwald , perhaps a junior king of west kent the letter to æthelburg makes it clear that she was already married at the time the news of eadbald 's conversion reached rome this is quite inconsistent with the earlier date bede gives for eadbald 's acceptance of christianity , and it has been suggested in bede 's defence that æthelburg married edwin substantially earlier and stayed in kent until 625 before travelling to rome , and that the letter was written while she was in kent the story of paulinus 's consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later , which is after the latest possible date for æthelburg 's marriage however , it may be that he traveled to northumbria prior to his consecration and only later became bishop also at about this time æthelburg 's marriage to edwin is arranged , perhaps before the conversion eadbald 's reduced power is apparent in his inability to restore mellitus to the see of london : in bede 's words , his authority in essex '' was not so effective as that of his father '' the relationship would have been valuable to eadbald , too ; it may have been as a result of this alliance that edwin 's overlordship of britain did not include kent another factor in edwin 's treatment of kent may have been the location of the archbishopric in canterbury : edwin was well aware of the importance of canterbury 's metropolitan status , and at one time planned to make york an archbishopric too , with paulinus as the planned first incumbent paulinus eventually returned to kent , where at eadbald 's and archbishop honorius 's request he became bishop of rochester , and york was not made an archbishopric for another century within a year of edwin 's death in 633 or 634 , oswald took the throne of northumbria , and it seems likely that his relations with eadbald were modelled on edwin 's an additional son , ecgfrith , is mentioned in a charter of eadbald 's , but the charter is a forgery , probably dating from the eleventh century eanflæd , eadbald 's niece , married oswiu , king of northumbria and the last of the northern angles bede listed as holding imperium over southern england it is known that the kings of kent had established royal control of trade in the late seventh century , but it is not known how early this control began there is archaeological evidence that suggests that the royal influence predates any of the written sources , and it may have been eadbald 's father , æthelberht , who took control of trade away from the aristocracy and made it a royal monopoly coins were probably first minted in kent in æthelberht 's reign , though none bear his name thrymsas are known from eadbald 's reign , but few are known that carry his name : one such was minted at london and inscribed '' avdvarld '' eadbald died in 640 , and according to most versions of the kentish royal legend was succeeded solely by his son eorcenberht however , an early text ( caligula a.xiv ) refers to eormenred as 'king ' , suggesting either he was a junior king under eorcenberht , or had a shared kingship
