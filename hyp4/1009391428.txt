the term is considered useful because what came to be known as the '' athenian school '' ( composed of socrates , plato , and aristotle ) signaled the rise of a new approach to philosophy ; friedrich nietzsche 's thesis that this shift began with plato rather than with socrates ( hence his nomenclature of '' pre-platonic philosophy '' ) has not prevented the predominance of the '' pre-socratic '' distinction it is not because he gave a cosmogony that john burnet calls him the '' first man of science , '' but because he gave a naturalistic explanation of the cosmos and supported it with reasons thales inspired the milesian school of philosophy and was followed by anaximander , who argued that the substratum or arche could not be water or any of the classical elements but was instead something '' unlimited '' or '' indefinite '' ( in greek , the apeiron ) despite their varied answers , the milesian school was searching for a natural substance that would remain unchanged despite appearing in different forms , and thus represents one of the first scientific attempts to answer the question that would lead to the development of modern atomic theory ; '' the milesians , '' says burnet , '' asked for the φύσις of all things xenophanes was highly influential to subsequent schools of philosophy he was seen as the founder of a line of philosophy that culminated in pyrrhonism , eusebius , praeparatio evangelica chapter xvii possibly an influence on eleatics , and a precursor to epicurus ' total break between science and religion pythagoras lived at roughly the same time that xenophanes did and , in contrast to the latter , the school that he founded sought to reconcile religious belief and reason little is known about his life with any reliability , however , and no writings of his survive , so it is possible that he was simply a mystic whose successors introduced rationalism into pythagoreanism , that he was simply a rationalism whose successors are responsible for the mysticism in pythagoreanism , or that he was actually the author of the doctrine ; there is no way to know for certain pythagoreanism also incorporated ascetic ideals , emphasizing purgation , metempsychosis , and consequently a respect for all animal life ; much was made of the correspondence between mathematics and the cosmos in a musical harmony pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things , there was the permanent principle of mathematics , and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation heraclitus must have lived after xenophanes and pythagoras , as he condemns them along with homer as proving that much learning can not teach a man to think ; since parmenides refers to him in the past tense , this would place him in the 5th century bce parmenides of elea cast his philosophy against those who held '' it is and is not the same , and all things travel in opposite directions , '' —presumably referring to heraclitus and those who followed him whereas the doctrines of the milesian school , in suggesting that the substratum could appear in a variety of different guises , implied that everything that exists is corpuscular , parmenides argued that the first principle of being was one , indivisible , and unchanging his theories were not well known by the time of plato , however , and they were ultimately incorporated into the work of his student , democritus john burnet posits its origin in the scientific progress of the previous centuries which suggested that being was radically different from what was experienced by the senses and , if comprehensible at all , was not comprehensible in terms of order ; the world in which people lived , on the other hand , was one of law and order , albeit of humankind 's own making the first person to call themselves a sophist , according to plato , was protagoras , whom he presents as teaching that all virtue is conventional the great statesman pericles was closely associated with this new learning and a friend of anaxagoras , however , and his political opponents struck at him by taking advantage of a conservative reaction against the philosophers ; it became a crime to investigate the things above the heavens or below the earth , subjects considered impious in the version of his defense speech presented by plato , he claims that it is the envy he arouses on account of his being a philosopher that will convict him while philosophy was an established pursuit prior to socrates , cicero credits him as '' the first who brought philosophy down from the heavens , placed it in cities , introduced it into families , and obliged it to examine into life and morals , and good and evil by this account he would be considered the founder of political philosophy antisthenes founded the school that would come to be known as cynicism and accused plato of distorting socrates ' teachings the philosophic movements that were to dominate the intellectual life of the roman empire were thus born in this febrile period following socrates ' activity , and either directly or indirectly influenced by him they were also absorbed by the expanding muslim world in the 7th through 10th centuries ad , from which they returned to the west as foundations of medieval philosophy and the renaissance , as discussed below ancient tradition ascribes thirty-six dialogues and thirteen letters to him , although of these only twenty-four of the dialogues are now universally recognized as authentic ; most modern scholars believe that at least twenty-eight dialogues and two of the letters were in fact written by plato , although all of the thirty-six dialogues have some defenders ( one dialogue , the laws , instead contains an '' athenian stranger '' ) along with xenophon , plato is the primary source of information about socrates ' life and beliefs and it is not always easy to distinguish between the two much of what is said about his doctrines is derived from what aristotle reports about them whereas the republic is premised on a distinction between the sort of knowledge possessed by the philosopher and that possessed by the king or political man , socrates explores only the character of the philosopher ; in the statesman , on the other hand , a participant referred to as the eleatic stranger discusses the sort of knowledge possessed by the political man , while socrates listens quietly one student of plato ( who would become another of the most influential philosophers of all time ) stressed the implication that understanding relies upon first-hand observation aristotle moved to athens from his native stageira in 367 bc and began to study philosophy ( perhaps even rhetoric , under isocrates ) , eventually enrolling at plato 's academy aristotle 's fame was not great during the hellenistic period , when stoic logic was in vogue , but later peripatetic commentators popularized his work , which eventually contributed heavily to islamic , jewish , and medieval christian philosophy socrates had held that virtue was the only human good , but he had also accepted a limited role for its utilitarian side , allowing pleasure to be a secondary goal of moral action its ethical teachings were derived from socrates , recognizing a single good , which was apparently combined with the eleatic doctrine of unity ' outlines of pyrrhonism ( upper ) pirrho • heliensis • plistarchi • filivs translation ( from latin ) : pyrrho • greek • son of plistarchus ( middle ) oportere • sapientem hanc illivs imitari secvritatem translation ( from latin ) : it is right wisdom then that all imitate this security ( pyrrho pointing at a peaceful pig munching his food ) ( lower ) whoever wants to apply the real wisdom , shall not mind trepidation and misery during the hellenistic and roman periods , many different schools of thought developed in the hellenistic world and then the greco-roman world elements of iranian philosophy and indian philosophy also had an influence the spread of christianity throughout the roman world , followed by the spread of islam , ushered in the end of hellenistic philosophy and the beginnings of medieval philosophy , which was dominated by the three abrahamic traditions : jewish philosophy , christian philosophy , and early islamic philosophy after returning to greece , pyrrho started a new school of philosophy , pyrrhonism , which taught that it is one 's opinions about non-evident matters ( i.e pyrrhonists dispute that the dogmatists – which includes all of pyrrhonism 's rival philosophies – have found truth regarding non-evident matters stoic physics was based in materialism , which was structured by logos , reason ( but also called god or fate ) around 266 bc , arcesilaus became head of the platonic academy , and adopted skepticism as a central tenet of platonism , making platonism nearly the same as pyrrhonism sextus empiricus , '' outlines of pyrrhonism '' i.33.225–231 this skeptical period of ancient platonism , from arcesilaus to philo of larissa , became known as the new academy , although some ancient authors added further subdivisions , such as a middle academy they based this position on plato 's phaedo , sections 64–67 , in which socrates discusses how knowledge is not accessible to mortals they acknowledged some vestiges of a moral law within , at best but a plausible guide , the possession of which , however , formed the real distinction between the sage and the fool following the end of the skeptical period of the academy with antiochus of ascalon , platonic thought entered the period of middle platonism , which absorbed ideas from the peripatetic and stoic schools also affected by the neopythagoreans , the neoplatonism , first of them plotinus , argued that mind exists before matter , and that the universe has a singular cause which must therefore be a single mind as such , neoplatonism became essentially a religion , and had great impact on gnosticism and christian theology in the byzantine empire greek ideas were preserved and studied , and not long after the first major expansion of islam , however , the abbasid caliphs authorized the gathering of greek manuscripts and hired translators to increase their prestige the re-introduction of these philosophies , accompanied by the new arabic commentaries , had a great influence on medieval philosophy such as thomas aquinas ancient philosophy byzantine philosophy dehellenization english words of greek origin international scientific vocabulary list of ancient greek philosophers translingualism transliteration of greek into english handbook of greek philosophy : from thales to the stoics analysis and fragments , trafford publishing john burnet , early greek philosophy , 1930 the making of fornication : eros , ethics , and political reform in greek philosophy and early christianity key themes in ancient philosophy ancient greek philosophy , entry in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy ancient greek philosophers , worldhistorycharts.com the impact of greek culture on normative judaism from the hellenistic period through the middle ages c
