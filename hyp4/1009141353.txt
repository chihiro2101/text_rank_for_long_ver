spee and the high command did not believe germany 's asian possessions could be defended and doubted the squadron could even survive in that theatre there they received news of the loss of the cruiser , which had previously detached from the squadron and had been raiding in the indian ocean on 26 november , the squadron set sail for cape horn , which they reached on 1 december , then anchored at picton island , where they stayed for three days distributing coal from a captured british collier , the drummuir , and hunting fisher had a long-standing disagreement with sturdee , who had been one of those calling for his earlier dismissal as first sea lord in 1911 , so he took the opportunity to appoint sturdee commander-in-chief , south atlantic and pacific , to command the new squadron from invincible although secrecy of the mission was considered important so as to surprise spee , lieutenant hirst from glasgow heard locals discussing the forthcoming arrival of the ships while ashore at cape verde on 17 november ; however the news did not reach spee from there , the fast light cruisers glasgow and bristol would patrol seeking spee , summoning reinforcements if they found him the armed merchant cruiser macedonia was ordered to patrol the harbour , while kent maintained steam in her boilers , ready to replace macedonia the next day , 8 december ; spee 's fleet arrived in the morning of the same day they were alone when felton received a telephone call from port stanley advising that german ships were approaching the islands the maids took turns riding to the top of a nearby hill to record the movements of the ships , which felton relayed to port stanley by telephone any british ship that tried to leave would have faced the full firepower of the german ships ; having a vessel sunk might also have blocked the rest of the british squadron inside the harbour hms kent was already making her way out of the harbour and had been ordered to pursue spee 's ships made aware of the german ships , sturdee had ordered the crews to breakfast , knowing that canopus had bought them time while steam was raised realising his danger too late , and having lost any chance to attack the british ships while they were at anchor , spee and his squadron dashed for the open sea the british left port around 10:00 it was 13:00 when the british battlecruisers opened fire , but it took them half an hour to get the range of sms leipzig despite initial success by scharnhorst and gneisenau in striking invincible , the british capital ships suffered little damage spee then turned to escape , but the battlecruisers came within extreme firing range 40 minutes later the list became worse at 16:04 , and she sank by 16:17 , taking von spee and the entire crew with her he was pulled from the water saying he was a first cousin of the british commander ( stoddart ) 14 of the known german force of eight ships , two escaped : the auxiliary seydlitz and the light cruiser dresden , which roamed at large for a further three months before her captain was cornered by a british squadron ( kent , glasgow and orama ) off the juan fern√°ndez islands on 14 march 1915 however , germany put several armed merchant cruiser into service as commerce raiders until the end of the war ( for example , see felix von luckner ) after the battle , german naval experts were baffled at why admiral spee attacked the base and how the two squadrons could have met so coincidentally in so many thousands miles of open waters it was generally believed spee was misled by the german admiralty into attacking the falklands , a royal naval fuelling base , after receiving intelligence from the german wireless station at valparaiso which reported the port free of royal navy warships despite the objection of three of his ships ' captains , spee proceeded to attack 255 however , in 1925 a german naval officer , franz von rintelen , interviewed admiral william reginald hall , director of the admiralty 's naval intelligence division ( nid ) , and was informed that spee 's squadron had been lured towards the british battlecruisers by means of a fake signal sent in a german naval code broken by british cryptographers
