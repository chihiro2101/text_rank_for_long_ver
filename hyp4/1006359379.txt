definitions of the term '' machine vision '' vary , but all include the technology and methods used to extract information from an image on an automated basis , as opposed to image processing , where the output is another image machine vision is practically the only term used for these functions in industrial automation applications ; the term is less universal for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision , a form of basic computer science ; machine vision attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems in a way that meets the requirements of industrial automation and similar application areas the first step in the automatic inspection sequence of operation is digital imaging , typically using cameras , lenses , and lighting that has been designed to provide the differentiation required by subsequent processing camera ) can either be separate from the main image processing unit or combined with it in which case the combination is generally called a smart camera or smart sensor inclusion of the full processing function into the same enclosure as the camera is often referred to as embedded processing july 2019 issue pages 60-64 when separated , the connection may be made to specialized intermediate hardware , a custom processing appliance , or a frame grabber within a computer using either an analog or standardized digital interface ( camera link , coaxpress ) color , frame rate , resolution , and whether or not the imaging process is simultaneous over the entire image , making it suitable for moving processes west , perry high speed , real-time machine vision cyberoptics , pages 1-38 though the vast majority of machine vision applications are solved using two-dimensional imaging , machine vision applications utilizing 3d imaging are a growing niche within the industry finding the optimal hardware for deep learining inference in machine vision by mike fussell vision systems design magazine september 2019 issue pages 8-9 multiple stages of processing are generally used in a sequence that ends up as a desired result machine vision image processing methods include ; stitching/registration : combining of adjacent 2d or 3d images neural net / deep learning / machine learning processing : weighted and self-training multi-variable decision making circa 2019 there is a large expansion of this , using deep learning and machine learning to significantly expand machine vision capabilities other common outputs include object position and orientation information for robot guidance systems additionally , output types include numerical measurement data , data read from codes and characters , counts and classification of objects , displays of the process or results , stored images , alarms from automated space monitoring mv systems , and process control signals machine vision commonly provides location and orientation information to a robot to allow the robot to properly grasp the product
