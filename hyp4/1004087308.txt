without loss of generality we can assume at least 3 of these edges , connecting the vertex , v , to vertices , r , s and t , are blue since this argument works for any colouring , any k 6 contains a monochromatic k 3 , and therefore r ( 3 , 3 ) ≤ 6 firstly , any given vertex will be the middle of either 0 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 5 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 0 ( all edges from the vertex are the same colour ) , 1 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 4 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 4 ( four are the same colour , one is the other colour ) , or 2 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 3 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 6 ( three are the same colour , two are the other colour ) such triples conversely , it is possible to 2-colour a k 5 without creating any monochromatic k 3 , showing that r ( 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; 5 there are ( up to symmetries ) only two non-trivial multicolour ramsey numbers for which the exact value is known , namely r ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 17 and r ( 3 , 3 , 4 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 30 consider the set of vertices that have a red edge to the vertex v since every vertex , except for v itself , is in one of the red , green or blue neighbourhoods of v , the entire complete graph can have at most 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 16 vertices it is known that there are exactly two edge colourings with 3 colours on k 15 that avoid monochromatic triangles , which can be constructed by deleting any vertex from the untwisted and twisted colourings on k 16 , respectively it is also known that there are exactly 115 edge colourings with 3 colours on k 14 that avoid monochromatic triangles , provided that we consider edge colourings that differ by a permutation of the colours as being the same consider a complete graph on vertices whose edges are coloured with two colours let r ( n ) be the smallest number q such that any complete graph with singly directed arcs ( also called a '' tournament '' ) and with ≥ & nbsp ; q nodes contains an acyclic ( also called '' transitive '' ) n-node subtournament in reverse mathematics , there is a significant difference in proof strength between the version of ramsey 's theorem for infinite graphs ( the case n 2 ) and for infinite multigraphs ( the case n ≥ 3 ) in contrast , by a theorem of david seetapun , the graph version of the theorem is weaker than aca 0 , and ( combining seetapun 's result with others ) it does not fall into one of the big five subsystems
