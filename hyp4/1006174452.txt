the book is divided into six parts , described in the author 's preface as : various considerations touching the sciences the principal rules of the method which the author has discovered certain of the rules of morals which he has deduced from this method the reasonings by which he establishes the existence of god and of the human soul the order of the physical questions which he has investigated , and , in particular , the explication of the motion of the heart and of some other difficulties pertaining to medicine , as also the difference between the soul of man and that of the brutes what the author believes to be required in order to greater advancement in the investigation of nature than has yet been made , with the reasons that have induced him to write for there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of anything than that every man is contented with his share , '' but also in montaigne , whose formulation indicates that it was a commonplace at the time : '' tis commonly said that the justest portion nature has given us of her favors is that of sense ; for there is no one who is not contented with his share '' descartes continues with a warning : descartes describes his disappointment with his education : '' as soon as i had finished the entire course of study…i found myself involved in so many doubts and errors , that i was convinced i had advanced no farther…than the discovery at every turn of my own ignorance the following three maxims were adopted by descartes so that he could effectively function in the '' real world '' while experimenting with his method of radical doubt but descartes believes three things are not susceptible to doubt and the three support each other to form a stable foundation for the method descartes supplies three different proofs for the existence of god , including what is now referred to as the ontological argument he goes on to say that he '' was not , however , disposed , from these circumstances , to conclude that this world had been created in the manner i described ; for it is much more likely that god made it at the first such as it was to be '' despite this admission , it seems that descartes ' project for understanding the world was that of re-creating creation—a cosmological project which aimed , through descartes ' particular brand of experimental method , to show not merely the possibility of such a system , but to suggest that this way of looking at the world—one with ( as descartes saw it ) no assumptions about god or nature—provided the only basis upon which he could see knowledge progressing ( as he states in book ii ) thus , in descartes ' work , we can see some of the fundamental assumptions of modern cosmology in evidence—the project of examining the historical construction of the universe through a set of quantitative laws describing interactions which would allow the ordered present to be constructed from a chaotic past '' three years have now elapsed since i finished the treatise containing all these matters ; and i was beginning to revise it , with the view to put it into the hands of a printer , when i learned that persons to whom i greatly defer , and whose authority over my actions is hardly less influential than is my own reason over my thoughts , had condemned a certain doctrine in physics , published a short time previously by another individual to which i will not say that i adhered , but only that , previously to their censure i had observed in it nothing which i could imagine to be prejudicial either to religion or to the state , and nothing therefore which would have prevented me from giving expression to it in writing , if reason had persuaded me of its truth ; and this led me to fear lest among my own doctrines likewise some one might be found in which i had departed from the truth , notwithstanding the great care i have always taken not to accord belief to new opinions of which i had not the most certain demonstrations , and not to give expression to aught that might tend to the hurt of any one & nbsp ; 6 ) '' of philosophy i will say nothing , except that when i saw that it had been cultivated for so many ages by the most distinguished men ; and that yet there is not a single matter within its sphere which is still not in dispute and nothing , therefore , which is above doubt , i did not presume to anticipate that my success would be greater in it than that of others & nbsp ; 8 ) '' … i entirely abandoned the study of letters , and resolved no longer to seek any other science than the knowledge of myself , or of the great book of the world.… '' ( part i , at p & nbsp ; 18 ) '' … in what regards manners , everyone is so full of his own wisdom , that there might be as many reformers as heads.… '' ( part vi , at p
