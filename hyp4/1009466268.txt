mahan believed that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea—and particularly with its commercial use in peace and its control in war two famous security advisors from the cold war period , henry kissinger and zbigniew brzezinski , argued to continue the united states geopolitical focus on eurasia and , particularly on russia , despite the fall of communism and the end of the cold war both continued their influence on geopolitics after the end of the cold war , writing books on the subject in the 1990s—diplomacy and the grand chessboard : american primacy and its geostrategic imperatives kissinger argued against the belief that with the dissolution of the ussr , hostile intentions had come to an end and traditional foreign policy considerations no longer applied '' therefore , the united states must '' maintain the global balance of power vis-à-vis the country with a long history of expansionism during the cold war , kissinger argues , both sides of the atlantic recognized that , '' unless america is organically involved in europe , it would later be obliged to involve itself under circumstances which would be far less favorable to both sides of the atlantic thus kissinger believed that no country 's interests would ever be served if germany and russia were to ever form a partnership in which each country would consider itself the principal partner the domination by a single power of either of eurasia 's two principal spheres—europe and asia—remains a good definition of strategic danger for america 813 the main interest of the american leaders is maintaining the balance of power in eurasia kissinger , henry , ( 1994 ) now , however , he focused on the beginning of the cold war : '' the objective of moral opposition to communism had merged with the geopolitical task of containing soviet expansion the grand chessboard described the american triumph in the cold war in terms of control over eurasia : for the first time ever , a '' non-eurasian '' power had emerged as a key arbiter of '' eurasian '' power relations it follows that… american foreign policy must…employ its influence in eurasia in a manner that creates a stable continental equilibrium , with the united states as the political arbiter.… eurasia is thus the chessboard on which the struggle for global primacy continues to be played , and that struggle involves geo- strategy – the strategic management of geopolitical interests… but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges , capable of dominating eurasia and thus also of challenging america… for america the chief geopolitical prize is eurasia…and america 's global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the eurasian continent is sustained sir halford mackinder 's heartland theory initially received little attention outside the world of geography , but some thinkers would claim that it subsequently influenced the foreign policy of world powers those scholars who look to mackinder through critical lenses accept him as an organic strategist who tried to build a foreign policy vision for britain with his eurocentric analysis of historical geography his work was based on assumptions similar to mackinder 's , including the unity of world politics and the world sea policy on preventing the spread of soviet influence after world war ii ( see also truman doctrine ) '' mackinder located his pivot , in the words of haushofer , on '' one of the first solid , geopolitically and geographically irreproachable maps , presented to one of the earliest scientific forums of the planet – the royal geographic society in london '' haushofer adopted both mackinder 's heartland thesis and his view of the russian-german alliance – powers that mackinder saw as the major contenders for control of eurasia in the twentieth century in 2004 , at the centenary of the geographical pivot of history , famous historian paul kennedy wrote : '' right now with hundreds of thousands of us troops in the eurasian rimlands and with administration constantly explaining why it has to stay the course , it looks as if washington is taking seriously mackinder 's injunction to ensure control of the geographical pivot of history popular views of the role of geopolitics in the nazi third reich suggest a fundamental significance on the part of the geo-politicians in the ideological orientation of the nazi state negative associations with the term '' geopolitics '' and its practical application stemming from its association with world war ii and pre-world war ii german scholars and students of geopolitics are largely specific to the field of academic geography , and especially sub-disciplines of human geography such as political geography however , this negative association is not as strong in disciplines such as history or political science , which make use of geopolitical concepts classical geopolitics forms an important element of analysis for military history as well as for sub-disciplines of political science such as international relations and security studies in disciplines outside geography , geopolitics is not negatively viewed ( as it often is among academic geographers such as carolyn gallaher or klaus dodds ) as a tool of imperialism or associated with nazism , but rather viewed as a valid and consistent manner of assessing major international geopolitical circumstances and events , not necessarily related to armed conflict or military operations french geography is focused on the evolution of polymorphic territories being the result of mankind 's actions due to the influence of german geopolitik on french geopolitics , the latter were for a long time banished from academic works while rejecting the generalizations and broad abstractions employed by the german and anglo-american traditions ( and the new geographers ) , this school does focus on spatial dimension of geopolitics affairs on different levels of analysis lacoste proposed that every conflict ( both local or global ) can be considered from a perspective grounded in three assumptions : representation : each group or individuals is the product of an education and is characterized by specific representations of the world or others groups or individuals the study of representation is a common point with the more contemporary critical geopolitics connected with this stream , and former member of hérodote editorial board , the french geographer michel foucher developed a long term analysis of international borders he coined various neologism among them : horogenesis : neologism that describes the concept of studying the birth of borders , dyade : border shared by two neighbouring states ( for instance us territory has two terrestrial dyades : one with canada and one with mexico ) thual taught geopolitics of the religions at the french war college , and has written thirty books devoted mainly to geopolitical method and its application to various parts of the world thual , aymeric chauprade , former professor of geopolitics at the french war college and now member of the extreme-right party '' front national '' , subscribes to a supposed '' new '' french school of geopolitics which advocates above all a return to realpolitik and '' clash of civilization '' ( huntington ) french philosopher michel foucault 's dispositif introduced for the purpose of biopolitics research was also adopted in the field of geopolitical thought where it now plays a role aleksandr dugin , a russian political analyst who has developed a close relationship with russia 's academy of the general staff wrote '' the foundations of geopolitics '' in 1997 , which has had a large influence within the russian military , police , and foreign policy elites and it has been used as a textbook in the academy of the general staff of the russian military
