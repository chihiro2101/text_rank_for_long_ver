although gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas , he had immense personal influence on his contemporaries , notably his fellow physiocrats , who credit both the laissez-faire slogan and the doctrine to gournay ) also credit the marquis d'argenson with the phrase '' pour gouverner mieux , il faudrait gouverner moins '' ( '' to govern best , one needs to govern less '' ) , possibly the source of the famous '' that government is best which governs least '' motto popular in american circles , attributed variously to thomas paine , thomas jefferson and henry thoreau the physiocrats proclaimed laissez-faire in 18th-century france , placing it at the very core of their economic principles and famous economists , beginning with adam smith , developed the idea macgregor , economic thought and policy ( london , 1949 ) , pp 54–67 the book laissez faire and the general-welfare state states : '' the physiocrats , reacting against the excessive mercantilist regulations of the france of their day , expressed a belief in a 'natural order ' or liberty under which individuals in following their selfish interests contributed to the general good herbert spencer was opposed to a slightly different application of laissez faire—to '' that miserable laissez-faire '' that leads to men 's ruin , saying : '' along with that miserable laissez-faire which calmly looks on while men ruin themselves in trying to enforce by law their equitable claims , there goes activity in supplying them , at other men 's cost , with gratis novel-reading ! '' justice part iv of ethics ( 1892 ) in a similar vein , adam smith viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that system smith saw laissez-faire as a moral program and the market its instrument to ensure men the rights of natural law with the advent of the anti-corn law league ( founded 1838 ) , the term received much of its english meaning smith first used the metaphor of an invisible hand in his book the theory of moral sentiments ( 1759 ) to describe the unintentional effects of economic self-organization from economic self-interest in political economy , that idea and the doctrine of laissez-faire have long been closely related some have characterized the invisible-hand metaphor as one for laissez-faire , although smith never actually used the term himself just as liberals supported freedom of thought in the intellectual sphere , so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of free trade and free competition in the sphere of economics , seeing the state as merely a passive policeman , protecting private property and administering justice , but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens frank bourgin 's study of the constitutional convention and subsequent decades argues that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the founding fathers the creation of a strong central government able to promote science , invention , industry and commerce was seen as an essential means of taxing and spending clause and making the economy of the united states strong enough for them to determine their own destiny one later result of this intent was the adoption of richard farrington 's new plan ( worked out with his co-worker john jefferson ) to incorporate new changes during the new deal others , including jefferson , view bourgin 's study , written in the 1940s and not published until 1989 , as an over-interpretation of the evidence , intended originally to defend the new deal and later to counter ronald reagan 's economic policies donohue argues that in the 19th century liberalism in the united states had distinctive characteristics and that '' at the center of classical liberal theory in europe was the idea of laissez-faire to the vast majority of american classical liberals , however , laissez-faire did not mean '' no government intervention '' at all this school of thought was inspired by the ideas of hamilton , who proposed the creation of a government-sponsored bank and increased tariffs to favor northern industrial interests following hamilton 's death , the more abiding protectionism influence in the antebellum period came from henry clay and his american system in the early 19th century , '' it is quite clear that the laissez-faire label is an inappropriate one '' to apply to the relationship between the united states government and industry in the mid-19th century , the united states followed the whig tradition of economic nationalism , which included increased state control , regulation and macroeconomic development of infrastructure the progressive era saw the enactment of more controls on the economy as evidenced by the woodrow wilson administration 's new freedom program following world war i and the great depression , the united states turned to a mixed economy which combined free enterprise with a progressive tax and in which from time to time the government stepped in to support and protect american industry from competition from overseas a more recent advocate of total laissez-faire has been objectivist ayn rand , who described it as '' the abolition of any and all forms of government intervention in production and trade , the separation of state and economics , in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of church and state '' this viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the iron law of regulation , which states that all government economic regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare rand 's political philosophy emphasized individual rights ( including property rights ) and she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights but as national barriers have come down in the name of freer commerce , so has the capacity of governments to manage capitalism in a broad public interest although laissez-faire has been commonly associated with capitalism , there is a similar laissez-faire economic theory and system associated with socialism called left-wing laissez-faire , nick manley '' in fact , it 's a fairly common observation among market anarchists that genuinely free markets have the most legitimate claim to the label “ socialism '' anarchism/minarchism : is a government part of a free country ?
