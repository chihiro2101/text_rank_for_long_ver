all moves will be from one grid point to another grid point players take turns to move their cars according to some simple rules each move is marked by drawing a line from the starting point of this move to a new point each player 's first move must be to one of the eight neighbours of their starting position ) on each turn after that , the player can choose to move the same number of squares in the same direction as on the previous turn ; the grid point reached by this move is called the principal point for this turn the track need not be a closed curve ; the starting and finishing lines could be different before starting to play , the players may go over the track , agreeing in advance about each grid point near the boundaries as to whether that point is inside or outside the track instead of allowing moves to any of eight neighbours of the principal point , one may use the four neighbours rule , limiting moves to the principal point or any of its four nearest neighbours on the track there may be also some turbo areas marked with an arrow with a specific length and direction usually , cars are required to stay on the track for the entire length of the move , not just the start and end on heavily convoluted racetracks , allowing the line segment representing a move to cross the boundary twice ( with start and end points inside the track ) , some unreasonable shortcuts may be allowed however , the most common and entertaining rule is that while the line segments are allowed to intersect , a car can not move to or through a grid point that is occupied by another car , as they would collide a player running off the track may be allowed to continue , but is required to brake and turn around , and re-enter the track again crossing the boundary at a point behind the point where it left if the collision rule mentioned above is used , there is still a considerable advantage in moving first this may be partially counterbalanced by having the players choose their individual starting points in reverse order , a move four squares to the right and two up may be represented by the vector ( 4,2 )
