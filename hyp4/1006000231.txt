although no evidence or documents have certified anyone as a child of gurdjieff , the following seven people are believed to be his children : paul beekman taylor , shadows of heaven : gurdjieff and toomer ( red wheel , 1998 ) , p gurdjieff and his school some contemporary researchers claim gurdjieff 's concept of 'self-remembering is close to the buddhist concept of awareness or a popular definition of “ mindfulness gurdjieff argued that many of the existing forms of religious and spiritual tradition on earth had lost connection with their original meaning and vitality and so could no longer serve humanity in the way that had been intended at their inception according to gurdjieff , only one dimension of the three dimensions of the person—namely , either the emotions , or the physical body or the mind—tends to develop in such schools and sects , and generally at the expense of the other faculties or centers , as gurdjieff called them gurdjieff thus developed a '' fourth way '' p the effort that is put into practice gurdjieff referred to as '' the work '' or '' work on oneself '' '' though gurdjieff never put major significance on the term '' fourth way '' and never used the term in his writings , his pupil p ouspensky from 1924 to 1947 made the term and its use central to his own teaching of gurdjieff 's ideas after ouspensky 's death , his students published a book titled the fourth way based on his lectures the fourth way , chapter 1 in his teaching gurdjieff gave a distinct meaning to various ancient texts such as the bible and many religious prayers '' sleep not '' ; '' awake , for you know not the hour '' ; and '' the kingdom of heaven is within '' are examples of biblical statements which point to teachings whose essence has been forgotten according to his teaching , this inner development of oneself is the beginning of a possible further process of change , the aim of which is to transform people into what gurdjieff believed they ought to be to provide conditions in which inner attention could be exercised more intensively , gurdjieff also taught his pupils '' sacred dances '' or '' movements '' , later known as the gurdjieff movements , which they performed together as a group he also left a body of music , inspired by what he heard in visits to remote monasteries and other places , written for piano in collaboration with one of his pupils , thomas de hartmann gurdjieff used a number of methods and materials , including meetings , music , movements ( sacred dance ) , writings , lectures , and innovative forms of group and individual work '' gurdjieff 's teachings were transmitted through special conditions and through special forms leading to consciousness : group work , physical labor , crafts , ideas exchanges , arts , music , movement , dance , adventures in nature in search of the miraculousm chapter 1 , whereas in paris and north america he gave numerous public demonstrations gurdjieff ( 1963 ) meetings with remarkable men , chapter 11 gurdjieff felt that the traditional methods of self-knowledge—those of the fakir , monk , and yogi ( acquired , respectively , through pain , devotion , and study ) —were inadequate on their own and often led to various forms of stagnation and one-sidedness the '' first period '' is the early music , including music from the ballet struggle of the magicians and music for early movements dating to the years around 1918 the '' second period '' music , for which gurdjieff arguably became best known , written in collaboration with russian composer thomas de hartmann , is described as the gurdjieff-de hartmann music this music was often first heard in the salon at the prieuré , where much was composed since the publication of four volumes of this piano repertoire by schott , recently completed , there has been a wealth of new recordings , including orchestral versions of music prepared by gurdjieff and de hartmann for the movements demonstrations of 1923–24 the '' last musical period '' is the improvised harmonium music which often followed the dinners gurdjieff held at his paris apartment during the occupation and immediate post-war years to his death in 1949 gurdjieff sometimes referred to himself as a '' teacher of dancing '' and gained initial public notice for his attempts to put on a ballet in moscow called struggle of the magicians films of movements demonstrations are occasionally shown for private viewing by the gurdjieff foundations , and one is shown in a scene in the peter brook movie meetings with remarkable men the first volume , finalized by gurdjieff shortly before his death and first published in 1950 , is the first series and titled an objectively impartial criticism of the life of man or beelzebub 's tales to his grandson see paul beekman taylor 's ' gurdjieff 's worlds of words ( 2014 ) for an informed account on his page of friendly advice facing the first contents page of beelzebub 's tales gurdjieff lays out his own program of three obligatory initial readings of each of the three series in sequence and concludes , '' only then will you be able to count upon forming your own impartial judgement , proper to yourself alone , on my writings '' the posthumous second series , edited by jeanne de salzmann , is titled meetings with remarkable men ( 1963 ) and is written in a seemingly accessible manner as a memoir of his early years , but also contains some 'arabian nights ' embellishments and allegorical statements his posthumous third series , ( life is real only then , when ' i am ' ) , written as if unfinished and also edited by jeanne de salzmann , contains an intimate account of gurdjieff 's inner struggles during his later years , as well as transcripts of some of his lectures an enormous and growing amount has been written about gurdjieff 's ideas and methods , but his own challenging writings remain the primary sources sympathizers regard him as a charismatic master who brought new knowledge into western culture , a psychology and cosmology that enable insights beyond those provided by established science gurdjieff gave new life and practical form to ancient teachings of both east and west there have been many attempts to trace the origins of this version of the enneagram ; some similarities to other figures have been found , but it seems that gurdjieff was the first person to make the enneagram figure publicly known and that only he knew its true source gurdjieff inspired the formation of many groups after his death , all of which still function today and follow his ideas willem nyland , one of gurdjieff 's closest students and an original founder and trustee of the gurdjieff foundation of new york , left to form his own groups in the early 1960s he met gurdjieff in 1915 and spent the next five years studying with him , then formed his own independent groups at london in 1921 ouspensky became the first '' career '' gurdjieffian and led independent fourth way groups in london and new york for his remaining years he wrote in search of the miraculous about his encounters with gurdjieff and it remains the best known and most widely read account of gurdjieff 's early experiments with groups she also authenticated gurdjieff 's early talks in the book views from the real world ( 1973 ) bennett ( 1897–1974 ) was a british intelligence officer , polyglot ( fluent in english , french , german , turkish , greek , italian ) , technologist , industrial research director , author , and teacher , best known for his many books on psychology and spirituality , particularly the teachings of gurdjieff see witness : the autobiography of john bennett ( 1974 ) , gurdjieff : making a new world ( 1974 ) , idiots in paris : diaries of j in 1931 , on ouspensky 's advice he started his own fourth way groups in england jane heap 's paris group became gurdjieff 's 'rope ' group after her departure , and contained several notable writers , including margaret anderson , solita solano , kathryn hulme , and others who proved helpful to gurdjieff while he was editing his first two books he was a member of ouspensky 's london group for decades , and after the latter 's death in 1947 visited gurdjieff in paris many times as well as many accessible medical books for lay readers , he wrote some of the earliest informed accounts of gurdjieff 's ideas , venture with ideas ( 1951 ) and a study of gurdjieff 's teaching ( 1957 ) henry miller approved of gurdjieff not considering himself holy but , after writing a brief introduction to fritz peters ' book boyhood with gurdjieff , miller wrote that people are not meant to lead a '' harmonious life '' as gurdjieff believed in naming his institute gurdjieff believed that the possession of a soul ( a state of psychological unity which he equated with being '' awake '' ) was a '' luxury '' that a disciple could attain only by the most painstaking work over a long period of time gurdjieff has been interpreted by some , ouspensky among others , to have had a total disregard for the value of mainstream religion , philanthropic work and the value of doing right or wrong in general the professor who told me this also assured me that gurdjieff had left many children around america king wrote that gurdjieff did not state it as clearly and specifically as this , but was quick to add that , to him , nothing gurdjieff said was specific or clear three books by gurdjieff were published in the english language in the united states after his death : beelzebub 's tales to his grandson published in 1950 by e , meetings with remarkable men , published in 1963 by e a legominism is , according to gurdjieff , '' one of the means of transmitting information about certain events of long-past ages through initiates '' a book of his early talks was also collected by his student and personal secretary , olga de hartmann , and published in 1973 as views from the real world the feature film meetings with remarkable men ( 1979 ) , loosely based on gurdjieff 's book by the same name , ends with performances of gurdjieff 's dances known simply as the '' exercises '' but later promoted as movements
