the work of leibniz also anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy , but his philosophy also looks back to the scholastic tradition , in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or a priori definitions rather than to empirical evidence his main achievement was a complete oeuvre on almost every scholarly subject of his time , displayed and unfolded according to his demonstrative-deductive , mathematical method , which perhaps represents the peak of enlightenment rationality in germany wolff was one of the first to use german as a language of scholarly instruction and research , although he also wrote in latin , so that an international audience could , and did , read him in 1781 , immanuel kant ( 1724–1804 ) published his critique of pure reason , in which he attempted to determine what we can and can not know through the use of reason independent of all experience since the publication of his critique , immanuel kant has been considered one of the greatest influences in all of western philosophy in the late 18th and early 19th century , one direct line of influence from kant is german idealism hegel was hugely influential throughout the nineteenth century ; by its end , according to bertrand russell , '' the leading academic philosophers , both in america and britain , were largely hegelian '' his influence has continued in contemporary philosophy but mainly in continental philosophy warren breckman , marx , the young hegelians , and the origins of radical social theory : dethroning the self , cambridge university press , 1999 , p ; young hegelians the young hegelians drew on hegel 's idea that the purpose and promise of history was the total negation of everything conducive to restricting freedom and reason ; and they proceeded to mount radical critiques , first of religion and then of the prussian political system they felt hegel 's apparent belief in the end of history conflicted with other aspects of his thought and that , contrary to his later thought , the dialectic was certainly not complete ; this they felt was ( painfully ) obvious given the irrationality of religious beliefs and the empirical lack of freedoms—especially political and religious freedoms—in existing prussian society the term 'right hegelian ' , for example , was never actually used by those to whom it was later ascribed , namely , hegel 's direct successors at the fredrick william university ( now the humboldt university of berlin ) schopenhauer 's most influential work , the world as will and representation ( 1818 ) , claimed that the world is fundamentally what we recognize in ourselves as our will 48 ( dover page 616 ) , '' the ascetic tendency is certainly unmistakable in early christianity , as it was developed in the writings of the desert fathers from the kernel of the new testament ; this tendency is the highest point to which everything strives upwards '' during the endtimes of schopenhauer 's life and subsequent years after his death , post-schopenhauerian pessimism became a rather popular '' trend '' in 19th century germany to respond to this growing criticism , a group of philosophers greatly influenced by schopenhauer such as julius bahnsen ( 1830–81 ) , karl robert eduard von hartmann ( 1842–1906 ) , philipp mainländer ( 1841–76 ) , and even some of his personal acquaintances developed their own brand of pessimism , each in their own unique way this also leads mainländer to the philosophical position of pluralism this is yet another respect in which he differentiates his philosophy from that of schopenhauer neo-kantianism refers broadly to a revived type of philosophy along the lines of that laid down by immanuel kant in the 18th century , or more specifically by schopenhauer 's critique of the kantian philosophy in his work the world as will and representation , as well as by other post-kantian philosophers such as jakob friedrich fries ( 1773–1843 ) and johann friedrich herbart ( 1776–1841 ) however , the ethical aspects of neo-kantian thought often drew them within the orbit of socialism , and they had an important influence on austromarxism and the revisionism of eduard bernstein in the early part of the 20th century , a group of german and austrian philosophers and scientists formed the vienna circle to promote scientific thought over hegelian system-building , which they saw as a bad influence on intellectual thought the group considered themselves logical positivists because they believed all knowledge is either derived through experience or arrived at through analytic statements , and they adopted the predicate logic of frege , as well as the early work of ludwig wittgenstein ( 1889–1951 ) as foundations to their work while some of the seminal philosophers of twentieth-century analytical philosophy were german-speakers , most german-language philosophy of the twentieth century tends to be defined not as analytical but 'continental ' philosophy – as befits germany 's position as part of the european 'continent ' as opposed to the british isles or other culturally european nations outside of europe it was then transformed by martin heidegger ( 1889–1976 ) , whose famous book being and time ( 1927 ) applied phenomenology to ontology , and who , along with ludwig wittgenstein , is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century schleiermacher wondered whether there could be a hermeneutics that was not a collection of pieces of ad hoc advice for the solution of specific problems with text interpretation but rather a '' general hermeneutics , '' which dealt with the '' art of understanding '' as such , which pertained to the structure and function of understanding wherever it occurs later in the 19th century , dilthey began to see possibilities for continuing schleiermacher 's general hermeneutics project as a '' general methodology of the humanities and social sciences '' no longer was it conceived of as being about understanding linguistic communication , or providing a methodological basis for the human sciences - as far as heidegger was concerned , hermeneutics is ontology , dealing with the most fundamental conditions of man 's being in the world goethe-institut list of german-language philosophers critical theory culture of germany german literature history of philosophy list of austrian intellectual traditions logical empiricism modern philosophy phenomenology postmodernism prussian virtues
