ethnography can also be used in other methodological frameworks , for instance , an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation according to john brewer , a leading social scientist , data collection methods are meant to capture the '' social meanings and ordinary activities '' brewer , john d multiple methods of data collection may be employed to facilitate a relationship that allows for a more personal and in-depth portrait of the informants and their community secondary research and document analysis are also used to provide insight into the research topic in the 21st century , anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed reflexivity refers to the researcher 's aim '' to explore the ways in which the researcher 's involvement with a particular study influences , acts upon and informs such research '' this process is often effective in revealing common cultural denominators connected to the topic being studied critical theory researchers address '' issues of power within the researcher-researched relationships and the links between knowledge and power an image can be contained within the physical world through a particular individual 's perspective , primarily based on that individual 's past experiences one example of an image is how an individual views a novel after completing it the physical entity that is the novel contains a specific image in the perspective of the interpreting individual and can only be expressed by the individual in the terms of '' i can tell you what an image is by telling you what it feels like the image presents the perspective , experiences , and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence , the individual will always contain this image in the group under study cultural and social anthropologists today place a high value on doing ethnographic research the typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people , almost always based at least in part on emic views of where the culture begins and ends ethnographies are also sometimes called '' case studies an ethnography is a specific kind of written observational science which provides an account of a particular culture , society , or community the experience set the idea for her to produce her theory of '' culture is personality writ large '' ( modell , 1988 ) by studying the culture between the different pueblo and plain indians , she discovered the culture isomorphism that would be considered her personalized unique approach to the study of anthropology using ethnographic techniques a typical ethnography attempts to be holistic and typically follows an outline to include a brief history of the culture in question , an analysis of the physical geography or terrain inhabited by the people under study , including climate , and often including what biological anthropologists call habitat material culture , technology , and means of subsistence are usually treated next , as they are typically bound up in physical geography and include descriptions of infrastructure writing culture helped bring changes to both anthropology and ethnography often described in terms of being 'postmodern , ' 'reflexive , ' 'literary , ' 'deconstructive , ' or 'poststructural ' in nature , in that the text helped to highlight the various epistemic and political predicaments that many practitioners saw as plaguing ethnographic representations and practices 190 in regards to this last point , writing culture became a focal point for looking at how ethnographers could describe different cultures and societies without denying the subjectivity of those individuals and groups being studied while simultaneously doing so without laying claim to absolute knowledge and objective authority 12 this exploration of the relationship between writer , audience , and subject has become a central tenet of contemporary anthropological and ethnographic practice in certain instances , active collaboration between the researcher ( s ) and subject ( s ) has helped blend the practice of collaboration in ethnographic fieldwork with the process of creating the ethnographic product resulting from the research another approach to ethnography in sociology comes in the form of institutional ethnography , developed by dorothy e smith for studying the social relations which structure people 's everyday lives beginning in the 1960s and 1970s , ethnographic research methods began to be widely used by communication scholars as the purpose of ethnography is to describe and interpret the shared and learned patterns of values , behaviors , beliefs , and language of a culture-sharing group , harris , ( 1968 ) , also agar ( 1980 ) note that ethnography is both a process and an outcome of the research studies such as gerry philipsen analysis of cultural communication strategies in a blue-collar , working-class neighborhood on the south side of chicago , speaking 'like a man ' in teamsterville , paved the way for the expansion of ethnographic research in the study of communication ethnographic work in communication studies seeks to explain '' how '' ordinary methods/practices/performances construct the ordinary actions used by ordinary people in the accomplishments of their identities like anthropology scholars , communication scholars often immerse themselves , and participate in and/or directly observe the particular social group being studied in this sense , tony salvador , genevieve bell , and ken anderson describe design ethnography as being '' a way of understanding the particulars of daily life in such a way as to increase the success probability of a new product or service or , more appropriately , to reduce the probability of failure specifically due to a lack of understanding of the basic behaviors and frameworks of consumers a simple guide for conducting consumer research by brian lischer companies make increasing use of ethnographic methods to understand consumers and consumption , or for new product development ( such as video ethnography ) '' substantive contribution : '' does the piece contribute to our understanding of social life ? '' aesthetic merit : '' does this piece succeed aesthetically ? '' reflexivity : '' how did the author come to write this text…is there adequate self-awareness and self-exposure for the reader to make judgments about the point of view ? '' for post-colonial critiques of ethnography from various locations , see essays in prem poddar et al , historical companion to postcolonial literatures -- continental europe and its empires , edinburgh university press , 2008 267 fine is not necessarily casting blame at ethnographic researchers but tries to show that researchers often make idealized ethical claims and standards which are inherently based on partial truths and self-deceptions while there is no international standard on ethnographic ethics , many western anthropologists look to the american anthropological association for guidance when conducting ethnographic work the code of ethics notes that anthropologists are part of a wider scholarly and political network , as well as human and natural environment , which needs to be reported on respectfully the code of ethics recognizes that sometimes very close and personal relationship can sometimes develop from doing ethnographic work the association acknowledges that the code is limited in scope ; ethnographic work can sometimes be multidisciplinary , and anthropologists need to be familiar with ethics and perspectives of other disciplines as well american anthropology association code of ethics , p.1-8 '' conducting research '' - when conducting research anthropologists need to be aware of the potential impacts of the research on the people and animals they study american anthropology association code of ethics , p.2-3 if the seeking of new knowledge will negatively impact the people and animals they will be studying they may not undertake the study according to the code of ethics american anthropology association code of ethics , p.4 '' application '' - when conducting an ethnography , anthropologists must be '' open with funders , colleagues , persons studied or providing information , and relevant parties affected by the work about the purpose ( s ) , potential impacts , and source ( s ) of support for the work '' american anthropology association code of ethics , p.5 '' dissemination of results '' - when disseminating results of an ethnography , '' anthropologists have an ethical obligation to consider the potential impact of both their research and the communication or dissemination of the results of their research on all directly or indirectly involved '' the kindly ethnographer '' – most ethnographers present themselves as being more sympathetic than they are , which aids in the research process , but is also deceptive '' the precise ethnographer '' – ethnographers often create the illusion that field notes are data and reflect what '' really '' happened '' the observant ethnographer '' – readers of ethnography are often led to assume the report of a scene is complete – that little of importance was missed these relationships are sometimes not accounted for within the reporting of the ethnography , although they may influence the research findings the individual skills of an ethnographer influence what appears to be the value of the research
