similar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details , and the nature of the particular applied problem one seeks the solution of a problem in the form of strings of numbers ( traditionally binary , although the best representations are usually those that reflect something about the problem being solved ) , by applying operators such as recombination and mutation ( sometimes one , sometimes both ) this type of ea is often used in optimization problems genetic programming – here the solutions are in the form of computer programs , and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem evolutionary programming – similar to genetic programming , but the structure of the program is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve gene expression programming – like genetic programming , gep also evolves computer programs but it explores a genotype-phenotype system , where computer programs of different sizes are encoded in linear chromosomes of fixed length evolution strategy – works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions , and typically uses self-adaptive mutation rates differential evolution – based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for numerical optimization problems neuroevolution – similar to genetic programming but the genomes represent artificial neural networks by describing structure and connection weights and gene expression programming successfully explores a genotype-phenotype system , where the genotype consists of linear multigenic chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes '' gene expression programming : a new adaptive algorithm for solving problems '' merrikh-bayat , '' the runner-root algorithm : a metaheuristic for solving unimodal and multimodal optimization problems inspired by runners and roots of plants in nature '' , applied soft computing , vol also primarily suited for numerical optimization problems adaptive dimensional search – unlike nature-inspired metaheuristic techniques , an adaptive dimensional search algorithm does not implement any metaphor as an underlying principle memetic algorithm – a hybrid method , inspired by richard dawkins 's notion of a meme , it commonly takes the form of a population-based algorithm coupled with individual learning procedures capable of performing local refinements
