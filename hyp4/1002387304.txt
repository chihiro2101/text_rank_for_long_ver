while the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations , special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the ancient greeks this method reached its high point with euclid 's elements ( 300 & nbsp ; bc ) , a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor : euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms ( though they do not always conform strictly to aristotelian templates ) indeed , many of their general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic plato ( 424/423 & nbsp ; bc 348/347 & nbsp ; bc ) insisted that mathematical objects , like other platonic ideas ( forms or essences ) , must be perfectly abstract and have a separate , non-material kind of existence , in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans it can be argued that platonism somehow comes as a necessary assumption underlying any mathematical work the protestant philosopher george berkeley ( 1685–1753 ) , in his campaign against the religious implications of newtonian mechanics , wrote a pamphlet on the lack of rational justifications of infinitesimal calculus : the analyst , a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician '' they are neither finite quantities , nor quantities infinitely small , nor yet nothing it gives a rigorous foundation of infinitesimal calculus based on the set of real numbers , arguably resolving the zeno paradoxes and berkeley 's arguments this reduction of real numbers and continuous functions in terms of rational numbers , and thus of natural numbers , was later integrated by cantor in his set theory , and axiomatized in terms of second order arithmetic by hilbert and bernays abel and galois 's works opened the way for the developments of group theory ( which would later be used to study symmetry in physics and other fields ) , and abstract algebra these concepts did not generalize numbers but combined notions of functions and sets which were not yet formalized , breaking away from familiar mathematical objects at that time , the main method for proving the consistency of a set of axioms was to provide a model for it the german mathematician gottlob frege ( 1848–1925 ) presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his begriffsschrift ( formula language ) published in 1879 , a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic this was still a second-order axiomatization ( expressing induction in terms of arbitrary subsets , thus with an implicit use of set theory ) as concerns for expressing theories in first-order logic were not yet understood in dedekind 's work , this approach appears as completely characterizing natural numbers and providing recursive definitions of addition and multiplication from the successor function and mathematical induction several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century , as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be consistently stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various paradoxes ( such as russell 's paradox ) a contradiction in a formal theory is a formal proof of an absurdity inside the theory ( such as , showing that this theory is inconsistent and must be rejected but a paradox may be either a surprising but true result in a given formal theory , or an informal argument leading to a contradiction , so that a candidate theory , if it is to be formalized , must disallow at least one of its steps ; in this case the problem is to find a satisfying theory without contradiction for instance , russell 's paradox may be expressed as '' there is no set of all sets '' ( except in some marginal axiomatic set theories ) the leading school was that of the formalist approach , of which david hilbert was the foremost proponent , culminating in what is known as hilbert 's program , which thought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a logical system proved sound by metamathematics finitism means the truth of a mathematical statement , in this view , is represented by the fact that the statement can be derived from the axioms of set theory using the rules of formal logic merely the use of formalism alone does not explain several issues : why we should use the axioms we do and not some others , why we should employ the logical rules we do and not some others , why do '' true '' mathematical statements ( e.g hermann weyl would ask these very questions of hilbert : in some cases these questions may be sufficiently answered through the study of formal theories , in disciplines such as reverse mathematics and computational complexity theory as noted by weyl , formal logical systems also run the risk of inconsistency ; in peano axioms , this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency , but there is debate over whether or not they are sufficiently finitism to be meaningful what hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system s was consistent , based on principles p that only made up a small part of s some modern theory in the philosophy of mathematics deny the existence of foundations in the original sense logicism is a school of thought , and research programme , in the philosophy of mathematics , based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical ' in nature several set theorists followed this approach and actively searched for axioms that may be considered as true for heuristic reasons and that would decide the continuum hypothesis precisely , for any consistent first-order theory it gives an '' explicit construction '' of a model described by the theory ; this model will be countable if the language of the theory is countable it is based on an iterative process of completion of the theory , where each step of the iteration consists in adding a formula to the axioms if it keeps the theory consistent ; but this consistency question is only semi-decidable ( an algorithm is available to find any contradiction but if there is none this consistency fact can remain unprovable ) however several difficulties remain : for any consistent theory this usually does not give just one world of objects , but an infinity of possible worlds that the theory might equally describe , with a possible diversity of truths between them in the case of set theory , none of the models obtained by this construction resemble the intended model , as they are countable while set theory intends to describe uncountable infinities as it gives models to all consistent theories without distinction , it gives no reason to accept or reject any axiom as long as the theory remains consistent , but regards all consistent axiomatic theories as referring to equally existing worlds hence the existence of models as given by the completeness theorem needs in fact two philosophical assumptions : the actual infinity of natural numbers and the consistency of the theory it showed how to construct , for any sufficiently powerful and consistent recursively axiomatizable system such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of arithmetic on the ( infinite ) set of natural numbers a statement that formally expresses its own unprovability , which he then proved equivalent to the claim of consistency of the theory ; so that ( assuming the consistency as true ) , the system is not powerful enough for proving its own consistency , let alone that a simpler system could do the job it thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be completely determined and reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in hilbert 's program in practice , most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems , or if they do , do not doubt the consistency of zfc , generally their preferred axiomatic system in most of mathematics as it is practiced , the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway , and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would run the risk of forming inconsistent theories ( such as logic and category theory ) , they may be treated carefully the development of category theory in the middle of the 20th century showed the usefulness of set theories guaranteeing the existence of larger classes than does zfc , such as von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory or tarski–grothendieck set theory , albeit that in very many cases the use of large cardinal axioms or grothendieck universes is formally eliminable
