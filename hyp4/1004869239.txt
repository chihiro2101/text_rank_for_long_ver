then it will be spontaneously re-emitted , either in the same frequency as the original or in a cascade , where the sum of the energies of the photons emitted will be equal to the energy of the one absorbed ( assuming the system returns to its original state ) which type of line is observed depends on the type of material and its temperature relative to another emission source the intensity of light , over a narrow frequency range , is reduced due to absorption by the material and re-emission in random directions by contrast , a bright emission line is produced when photons from a hot material are detected in the presence of a broad spectrum from a cold source the intensity of light , over a narrow frequency range , is increased due to emission by the material spectral lines are highly atom-specific , and can be used to identify the chemical composition of any medium capable of letting light pass through it spectral lines also depend on the physical conditions of the gas , so they are widely used to determine the chemical composition of stars and other celestial bodies that can not be analyzed by other means , as well as their physical conditions there are a number of effects which control spectral line shape broadening due to local conditions is due to effects which hold in a small region around the emitting element , usually small enough to assure local thermodynamic equilibrium broadening due to extended conditions may result from changes to the spectral distribution of the radiation as it traverses its path to the observer there are two limiting cases by which this occurs : impact pressure broadening or collisional broadening : the collision of other particles with the light emitting particle interrupts the emission process , and by shortening the characteristic time for the process , increases the uncertainty in the energy emitted ( as occurs in natural broadening ) pressure broadening may also be classified by the nature of the perturbing force as follows : linear stark broadening occurs via the linear stark effect , which results from the interaction of an emitter with an electric field of a charged particle at a distance r , causing a shift in energy that is linear in the field strength inhomogeneous broadening is a general term for broadening because some emitting particles are in a different local environment from others , and therefore emit at a different frequency certain types of broadening are the result of conditions over a large region of space rather than simply upon conditions that are local to the emitting particle radiation emitted by a moving source is subject to doppler shift due to a finite line-of-sight velocity projection for example , radiation emitted from a distant rotating body , such as a star , will be broadened due to the line-of-sight variations in velocity on opposite sides of the star assuming each effect is independent , the observed line profile is a convolution of the line profiles of each mechanism for each element , the following table shows the spectral lines which appear in the visible spectrum at about 400-700 nm without qualification , '' spectral lines '' generally implies that one is talking about lines with wavelengths which fall into the range of the visible spectrum
