stress may be realized to varying degrees on different words in a sentence ; sometimes the difference between the acoustic signals of stressed and unstressed syllables are minimal these particular distinguishing features of stress , or types of prominence in which particular features are dominant , are sometimes referred to as particular types of accent – dynamic accent in the case of loudness , pitch accent in the case of pitch ( although that term usually has more specialized meanings ) , quantitative accent in the case of length , and qualitative accent in the case of differences in articulation the position of lexical stress in a word may depend on certain general rules applicable in the language or dialect in question , but in other languages , it must be learned for each word , as it is largely unpredictable in some cases , classes of words in a language differ in their stress properties ; for example , loanwords into a language with fixed stress may preserve stress placement from the source language , or the sezer stress other languages have stress placed on different syllables but in a predictable way , as in classical arabic and latin , where stress is conditioned by the structure of particular syllables statements about the position of stress are sometimes affected by the fact that when a word is spoken in isolation , prosodic factors ( see below ) come into play , which do not apply when the word is spoken normally within a sentence french words are sometimes said to be stressed on the final syllable , but that can be attributed to the prosodic stress that is placed on the last syllable ( unless it is a schwa , when stress is placed on the second-last syllable ) of any string of words in that language languages in which the position of stress in a word is not fully predictable are said to have phonemic stress stress is usually truly lexical and must be memorized as part of the pronunciation of an individual word sometimes , stress is fixed for all forms of a particular word , or it can fall on different syllables in different inflections of the same word in such languages with phonemic stress , the position of stress can serve to distinguish otherwise identical words for example , the english words insight and incite are distinguished in pronunciation only by the fact that the stress falls on the first syllable in the former and on the second syllable in the latter there may also be limitations on certain phonemes in the language in which stress determines whether they are allowed to occur in a particular syllable or not for instance , the english word laboratory is stressed on the second syllable in british english ( labóratory often pronounced '' labóratry '' , the second o being silent ) , but the first syllable in american english , with a secondary stress on the '' tor ' syllable ( láboratory often pronounced '' lábratory '' ) with very few exceptions , english compound words are stressed on their first component in english , it is not fully predictable , but the different secondary stress of the words organization and accumulation ( on the first and second syllable , respectively ) is predictable due to the same stress of the verbs órganize and accúmulate ) a course in phonetics § & nbsp ; 5.4 ; ( 1980 ) preliminaries to linguistic phonetics p 83 they find that the multiple levels posited for english , whether primary–secondary or primary–secondary–tertiary , are not phonetic stress ( let alone phoneme ) , and that the supposed secondary/tertiary stress is not characterized by the increase in respiratory activity associated with primary/secondary stress in english and other languages ( for further detail see stress and vowel reduction in english it may involve a certain natural stress pattern characteristic of a given language , but may also involve the placing of emphasis on particular words because of their relative importance ( contrastive stress ) a similar pattern is found in english ( see above ) : the traditional distinction between ( lexical ) primary and secondary stress is replaced partly by a prosodic rule stating that the final stressed syllable in a phrase is given additional stress ( a word spoken alone becomes such a phrase , hence such prosodic stress may appear to be lexical if the pronunciation of words is analyzed in a standalone context rather than within phrases ) another type of prosodic stress pattern is quantity sensitivity – in some languages additional stress tends to be placed on syllables that are longer ( moraically heavy ) in many languages , such as russian and english , vowel reduction may occur when a vowel changes from a stressed to an unstressed position in english , unstressed vowels may reduce to schwa-like vowels , though the details vary with dialect ( see stress and vowel reduction in english ) the effect may be dependent on lexical stress ( for example , the unstressed first syllable of the word photographer contains a schwa , whereas the stressed first syllable of photograph does not , or on prosodic stress ( for example , the word of is pronounced with a schwa when it is unstressed within a sentence , but not when it is stressed ) the language has generally been described as having contrastive word stress or accent as evidenced by numerous stem and stem-clitic minimal pairs such as /mɒhi/ mɒ.hí ( '' fish '' ) and /mɒh-i/ mɒ́.hi ( '' some month '' ) ( the acute accent is also used on some monosyllables in order to distinguish homographs , as in ( '' the '' ) and ( '' or '' ) ; here the stress of the two words is the same ) in spanish language , stress may be written explicitly with a single acute accent on a vowel the orthography has an extensive set of rules that describe the placement of diacritics , based on the position of the stressed syllable and the surrounding letters
