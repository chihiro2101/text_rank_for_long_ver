prior even to the united states ' use of nuclear bombs in hiroshima and nagasaki , the soviet union had been developing the technology to make similar devices although the two powers never engaged in an full scale war , both countries were constantly preparing for an all-out nuclear war it was vital to know what the adversary was up to , and the possibility of using the hi-tech surveillance that is used today was not around portland spy ring : the portland spy ring operated in england , as a soviet spy ring , from the 1950s until 1961 when the core of the network were arrested by british security services this spy ring was unique because they did not use the cover of an embassy as the cover for their spies his job was to aid placement of soviet spies within the united states government the united states treasury department was successfully infiltrated by many soviet spies , the most successful of which belonged to the silvermaster spy ring many of the members of the atomic spies group worked for , or around , the manhattan project , or the united states building of the atomic bomb morris cohen : an american who gained insight to the plans from the secret laboratory at los alamos and delivered it to the designers of the soviet atomic bomb this gadget was used by most spies at the time including those in the cia photo overdrive - a tool that was much larger than many other spy equipment weapons system 117l - weapons system 117l was the first program designed to develop space-based reconnaissance satellite systems several satellite systems would be developed through this program including corona , the satellite and missile observation system ( samos ) , and the missile detection alarm system ( midas ) samos - samos or the satellite and missile observation system was one of the first of a series of short lived satellite systems developed by the united states , operated from october 1960 to november 1962 the system consisted of three primary components : visual reconnaissance , communications , and electronic intelligence gathering the satellite could produce photos with 100 foot resolution this system was designed to be made of twelve satellites , although only nine satellites were successfully launched the system was designed to provide early warning of soviet missile launches this system , however , would be directly responsible for technologies used in its successors all of the corona missions , with the exception of the kh-11 kennan program , would make use of photographic film , which would have to survive re-entry through the atmosphere and be recovered 144 satellites would be launched through this program , and 102 returned usable photos this program would be led by the newly established national reconnaissance office , and operated from marchâ€“july 1963 it was among the first successful corona missions as it produced some of the first high resolution photos gambit satellites would make use of a three camera system and missions would last typically up to eight days kh-8 gambit 3 ( kh-8 ) - the gambit iii satellite system was amongst the longest serving satellite reconnaissance programs operated by the united states during the cold war the average mission time of the gambit iii satellite systems were thirty-one days the gambit iii satellites would differ from the gambit i satellites in that the gambit iii had a four camera system , which carried over twelve thousand feet of film , and were able to produce resolutions as small as four inches the hexagon system was officially known as the broad coverage photo reconnaissance satellites these satellites were also used for mapping missions , which were used in map making according to leaked documents , this program is currently operation under the code name evolved enhanced crystal these satellites became famous in 1978 when a cia employee tried to leak the design of the satellite to the soviets a total of twelve vela satellites were launched during the course of the cold war it was theorized at the time that it was a nuclear test conducted by south africa and israel , but new evidence does not support this theory they have also been used in the study of gamma-ray burst during the course of its lifespan over 500 zenith satellites were launched , making it the most used satellite system ever after 1990s new memoirs and archival materials have opened up the study of espionage and intelligence during the cold war special attention is paid to how complex images of one 's adversaries were shaped by secret intelligence that is now publicly known
