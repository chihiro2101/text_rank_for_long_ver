certain assumptions about the mass media he further argued that moral panic gives rise to the folk devil by labelling actions and people according to goode and ben-yehuda , moral panic consists of the following characteristics : concern – there must be the belief that the behavior of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society consensus – though concern does not have to be nationwide , there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society it is important to note the quick decline in political success for the

rock music , glorified and promoted satanism through ways that could be accepted subconsciously , a rumor boosted by the film the exorcist , in which satanic backmasking was a plot point this culminated in the proposal in 1983 of bills in california and arkansas , and later in 1985 with a hearing by the parents music resource center , of which the targeting of rock and heavy metal ( often

scientific community unintentionally worked together in '' promoting an unreasonable fear of violent video games '' concerns from parts of the public about violent games led to cautionary , often exaggerated news stories , warnings from politicians and other public figures , and calls for research to prove the connection , which in turn led to studies '' speaking beyond the available data and

conservative groups lowenkron wrote : '' concerned about the increasing expansion and acceptance of so-called 'sexual deviations ' during what was called the libertarian age from the 1960s to the
