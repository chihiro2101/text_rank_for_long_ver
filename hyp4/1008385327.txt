according to this theory , palmistry developed in india and then extended across the world ) , who took great interest in examining the character of his officers by analyzing the lines on their hands after studying under gurus in india , he set up a palmistry practice in london and enjoyed a wide following of famous clients from around the world , including famous celebrities like mark twain , w palmistry there were attempts at formulating some sort of scientific basis for the art , most notably in the 1900 publication the laws of scientific hand reading by william g chiromancy consists of the practice of evaluating a person 's character or future life by '' reading '' the palm of that person 's hand a reader usually begins by reading the person 's handedness ( the hand they write with or use the most , which is sometimes considered to represent the conscious mind , whereas the other hand is subconscious ) each area of the palm and fingers is related to a god or goddess , and the features of that area indicate the nature of the corresponding aspect of the subject for example , characteristics of the ring finger are tied to the subject 's dealings with art , music , aesthetics , fame , wealth , and harmony the number and quality of lines can also be included in the hand shape analysis ; in some traditions of palmistry , earth and water hands tend to have fewer , deeper lines , while air and fire hands are more likely to show more lines with less clear definition right the three lines found on almost all hands , and generally given most weight by palmists : the heart line is the first of the major lines examined by a reader and represents love and attraction palmists interpret this line to represent their subject 's emotional life ; it is therefore believed to give an insight into how the emotional side of their mindframe will act out and be acted upon during their lifetime the line is also claimed to indicate romantic perspectives and intimate relationships ; for example , a chained or gridded heart line is said to point to a flirtatious attitude to love , one which can be prone to fall in love easily often , the head line is joined with the life line ( see below ) at inception palmists generally interpret this line to represent their subject 's mind and the way it works , including learning style , communication style , intellectualism , and thirst for knowledge the life line is perhaps the most controversial line on the hand modern palmists generally do not believe that the length of a person 's life line is tied to the length of a person 's life the combined length of these three main lines ( heart , head , life ) can also be of interest it is said that if this combined length is longer than the subject 's foot , they may be overbearing , and if it is shorter they may give in too easily to other people , whereas a similar length suggests a well balanced individual this has special significance , since this single line must be read to infer details about a subject 's emotional and reasoning nature according to cheiro , this line is thought to endow a person with an intensity of purpose or single-mindedness , the nature of which is decided upon by exact position of this line on the hand and the direction of any branches shooting from it in hands where such a line exists without any branches as a singular mark , it is taken to indicate an extremely intense nature and special care is needed for such persons the upper part of the palm lying immediately below the fingers is considered to represent the higher or intellectual nature and the lower part of the palm to represent the materialistic side of the nature if one of these parts is larger than the other , as decided by the central placement of the simian crease , it shows greater development of that aspect of the nature the direction in which any branches may be found shooting from this line are used to infer more details about the subject 's temperament sometimes this line is thought to reflect circumstances beyond the individual 's control , or alternately the person 's choices and their consequences
