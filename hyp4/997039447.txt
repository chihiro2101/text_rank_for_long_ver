addition of a trigger electrode to a device allowed the glow discharge to be initiated by an external control circuit ; bell laboratories developed a '' trigger tube '' cold-cathode device in 1936 voltage regulator tubes rely on the relatively constant voltage of a glow discharge over a range of current and were used to stabilize power-supply voltages in tube-based instruments each time a pulse is applied to a control electrode , a glow discharge moves to a step electrode ; by providing ten electrodes in each tube and cascading the tubes , a counter system can be developed and the count observed by the position of the glow discharges the flash tube is a cold-cathode device filled with xenon gas , used to produce an intense short pulse of light for photography or to act as a stroboscope to examine the motion of moving parts the result is for each electron that leaves the cathode , several positive ions are generated that eventually crash onto the cathode the resulting strong electric field near the cathode accelerates ions to a sufficient velocity to create free electrons from the cathode material another mechanism to generate free electrons from a cold metallic surface is field electron emission although creating the initial space charge and the first arc of current through the tube may require a very high voltage , once the tube begins to heat up , the electrical resistance drops , thus increasing the electric current through the lamp in the case of tubes with an ionizing gas , the gas can become a very hot plasma , and electrical resistance is greatly reduced large cold-cathode fluorescent lamps ( ccfls ) have been produced in the past and are still used today when shaped , long-life linear light sources are required costs are similar to those of traditional fluorescent lighting , but with several advantages : the light emitted is , bulbs turn on instantly to full output and are also dimmable in systems using alternating current but without separate anode structures , the electrodes alternate as anodes and cathodes , and the impinging electrons can cause substantial localized heating , often to red heat ( instant-start fluorescent lamps employ this aspect ; they start as cold-cathode devices , but soon localized heating of the fine tungsten-wire cathodes causes them to operate in the same mode as hot-cathode lamps
