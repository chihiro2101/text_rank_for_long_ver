physical exercises are generally grouped into three types , depending on the overall effect they have on the human body : aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting anaerobic exercise , which includes strength and resistance training , can firm , strengthen , and increase muscle mass , as well as improve bone density , balance , and coordination multiple component community-wide campaigns are frequently used in an attempt to increase a population 's level of physical activity however , there is some evidence that school-based interventions can increase activity levels and fitness in children another cochrane review found some evidence that certain types of exercise programmes , such as those involving gait , balance , co-ordination and functional tasks , can improve balance in older adults following progressive resistance training , older adults also respond with improved physical function environmental approaches appear promising : signs that encourage the use of stairs , as well as community campaigns , may increase exercise levels parents can thus promote physical activity and limit the amount of time children spend in front of screens according to the centers for disease control and prevention in the united states , children and adolescents should do 60 minutes or more of physical activity each day implementing physical exercise in the school system and ensuring an environment in which children can reduce barriers to maintain a healthy lifestyle is essential the european commission 's directorate-general for education and culture ( dg eac ) has dedicated programs and funds for health enhancing physical activity ( hepa ) projects within its horizon 2020 and erasmus+ program , as research showed that too many europeans are not physically active enough people may exercise for personal enjoyment , health and well-being , social interactions , competition or training , etc when exercising , it becomes even more important to have a good diet to ensure that the body has the correct ratio of macronutrients while providing ample micronutrients , in order to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise removing lactate from circulation allows for an easy decline in body temperature , which can also benefit the immune system , as an individual may be vulnerable to minor illnesses if the body temperature drops too abruptly after physical exercise morris noted that men of similar social class and occupation ( bus conductors versus bus drivers ) had markedly different rates of heart attacks , depending on the level of exercise they got : bus drivers had a sedentary occupation and a higher incidence of heart disease , while bus conductors were forced to move continually and had a lower incidence of heart disease studies of animals indicate that physical activity may be more adaptable than changes in food intake to regulate energy balance no effect of endurance training was found in most studies of lizards , although one study did report a training effect
