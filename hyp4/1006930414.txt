prussian blue pigment is significant since it was the first stable and relatively lightfast blue pigment to be widely used following the loss of knowledge regarding the synthesis of egyptian blue prussian blue ( also · x was probably synthesized for the first time by the paint maker diesbach in berlin around 1706 instead , the blood , potash , and iron sulfate reacted to create a compound known as iron ferrocyanide , which , unlike the desired red pigment , has a very distinct blue hue by august 1709 , the pigment had been termed ; by november 1709 , the german name had been used for the first time by frisch around 1710 , painters at the prussian court were already using the pigment diesbach was attempting to create a red lake pigment from cochineal , but obtained the blue instead as a result of the contaminated potash he was using macquer made the important step of showing prussian blue could be reduced to a salt of iron and a new acid , which could be used to reconstitute the dye the new acid , hydrogen cyanide , first isolated from prussian blue in pure form and characterized in 1782 by swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele , scheele , carl w was eventually given the name ( literally '' blue acid '' ) because of its derivation from prussian blue , and in english became known popularly as prussic acid cyanide , a colorless anion that forms in the process of making prussian blue , derives its name from the greek word for dark blue the iron in this material is all ferrous , hence the absence of deep color associated with the mixed valency academic press , 2001 ; google books despite the fact that it is prepared from cyanide salts , prussian blue is not toxic because the cyanide groups are tightly bound to iron in former times , the addition of iron ( ii ) salts to a solution of ferricyanide was thought to afford a material different from prussian blue despite being one of the oldest known synthetic compounds , the composition of prussian blue remained uncertain for many years its precise identification was complicated by three factors : prussian blue is extremely insoluble , but also tends to form colloids traditional syntheses tend to afford impure compositions even pure prussian blue is structurally complex , defying routine crystallographic analysis since x-ray diffraction can not easily distinguish carbon from nitrogen in the presence of heavier elements such as iron , the location of these lighter elements is deduced by spectroscopic means , as well as by observing the distances from the iron atom centers the intense blue color of prussian blue is associated with the energy of the transfer of electrons from fe ( ii ) to fe ( iii ) this change is caused by reduction of the fe ( iii ) to fe ( ii ) , eliminating the intervalence charge transfer that causes prussian blue 's color it was adopted as a pigment very soon after its invention and was almost immediately widely used in oil painting , watercolor , and dyeing the dominant uses are for pigments : about 12,000 tonnes of prussian blue are produced annually for use in black and bluish inks engineer 's blue and the pigment formed on cyanotypes—giving them their common name blueprints nanoparticles of prussian blue are used as pigments in some cosmetics ingredients , according to the european union observatory for nanomaterials the original stain formula , known historically ( 1867 ) as '' perls prussian blue '' after its inventor , german pathologist max perls ( 1843–1881 ) , used separate solutions of potassium ferrocyanide and acid to stain tissue ( these are now used combined , just before staining ) prussian blue is preferable because it will not abrade the extremely precise reference surfaces as many ground pigments may the fda 's page on prussian blue the cdc 's page on prussian blue national pollutant inventory – cyanide compounds fact sheet heyltex corporation distributors of radiogardase ( prussian blue insoluble capsules ) sarah lowengard , '' prussian blue '' in the creation of color in eighteenth century europe columbia university press , 2006 prussian blue , colourlex
