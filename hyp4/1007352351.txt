in inductive reasoning , one makes a series of observations and infers a new claim based on them the focus upon the gap between the premises and conclusion present in the above passage appears different from hume 's focus upon the circular reasoning of induction what was hume 's contribution to the problem of induction ? the philosophical quarterly 45 ( 181 ) :460–470 that although sextus 's approach to the problem appears different , hume 's approach was actually an application of another argument raised by sextus : sextus empiricus the cārvāka , a materialist and skeptic school of indian philosophy , used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge they held that since inference needed an invariable connection between the middle term and the predicate , and further , that since there was no way to establish this invariable connection , that the efficacy of inference as a means of valid knowledge could never be stated pg 533 the 9th century indian skeptic , jayarāśi bhaṭṭa , also made an attack on inference , along with all means of knowledge , and showed by a type of reductio argument that there was no way to conclude universal relations from the observation of particular instances specifically , matters of fact are established by making an inference about causes and effects from repeatedly observed experience while relations of ideas are supported by reason alone , matters of fact must rely on the connection of a cause and effect through experience '' hume situates his introduction to the problem of induction in a treatise of human nature within his larger discussion on the nature of causes and effects ( book i , part iii , section vi ) from this discussion , hume goes onto present his formulation of the problem of induction in a treatise of human nature , writing '' there can be no demonstrative arguments to prove , that those instances , of which we have had no experience , resemble those , of which we have had experience '' in other words , the problem of induction can be framed in the following way : we can not apply a conclusion about a particular set of observations to a more general set of observations hume 's treatment of induction helps to establish the grounds for probability , as he writes in a treatise of human nature that '' probability is founded on the presumption of a resemblance betwixt those objects , of which we have had experience , and those , of which we have had none '' ( book i , part iii , section vi ) hume does not challenge that induction is performed by the human mind automatically , but rather hopes to show more clearly how much human inference depends on inductive—not a priori—reasoning he does not deny future uses of induction , but shows that it is distinct from deductive reasoning , helps to ground causation , and wants to inquire more deeply into its validity for example , one might argue that it is valid to use inductive inference in the future because this type of reasoning has yielded accurate results in the past however , this argument relies on an inductive premise itself—that past observations of induction being valid will mean that future observations of induction will also be valid a real property of real things ) can be legitimately used in a scientific hypothesis he argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the possibility of a reason for the predicate , located in the enduring nature of something it is by custom or habit that one draws the inductive connection described above , and '' without the influence of custom we would be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses '' this intuition was taken into account by keith campbell by considering that , to be built , a concept must be reapplied , which demands a certain continuity in its object of application and consequently some openness to induction consequently , – contra hume – some form of principle of homogeneity ( causal or structural ) between future and past must be warranted , which would make some inductive procedure always possible instead , knowledge is created by conjecture and criticism according to popper , the problem of induction as usually conceived is asking the wrong question : it is asking how to justify theories given they can not be justified by induction logic of scientific discovery , section 43 popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand ( which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are many ways that they could turn out to be wrong ) , but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far ( that they are highly corroborated ) that means popperians need to make a selection from the number of unfalsified theories available to them , which is generally more than one popperians would wish to choose well-corroborated theories , in their sense of corroboration , but face a dilemma : either they are making the essentially inductive claim that a theory 's having survived criticism in the past means it will be a reliable predictor in the future ; or popperian corroboration is no indicator of predictive power at all , so there is no rational motivation for their preferred selection principle the rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory is that it is simply easier to falsify : well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment ( already conducted at least once ) could have falsified ( but did not actually falsify ) the one theory , while the same kind of experiment , regardless of its outcome , could not have falsified the other
