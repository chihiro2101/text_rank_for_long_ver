alternative death rituals emphasizing one method of disposal of a body—inhumation ( burial ) , cremation , or exposure—have gone through periods of preference throughout history cremation appeared around the 12th century bce , constituting a new practice of burial , probably influenced by anatolia this may be an anachronism , as during mycenaean times burial was generally preferred , and homer may have been reflecting the more common use of cremation at the time the iliad was written , centuries later in parts of europe , cremation was forbidden by law , and even punishable by death if combined with heathen rites this was made possible by the invention of new furnace technology and contact with eastern cultures that practiced it at the time , many proponents believed in the miasma theory , and that cremation would reduce the '' bad air '' that caused diseases his main reason for supporting cremation was that '' it was becoming a necessary sanitary precaution against the propagation of disease among a population daily growing larger in relation to the area it occupied '' in addition , he believed , cremation would prevent premature burial , reduce the expense of funerals , spare mourners the necessity of standing exposed to the weather during interment , and urns would be safe from vandalism as embalming became more widely accepted and used , crematories lost their sanitary edge not to be left behind , crematories had an idea of making cremation beautiful australia also started to establish modern cremation movements and societies laws against cremation were challenged and invalidated in 1915 ( two years after the construction of the first crematorium in the netherlands ) , though cremation did not become legally recognised until 1955 the efficiency of industrialised killing of operation reinhard during the most deadly phase of the holocaust produced too many corpses , therefore the crematoria manufactured to ss specifications were put into use in all of them to handle the disposals around the clock , day and night the holocaust furnaces were supplied by a number of manufacturers , with the best known and most common being topf and sons as well as kori company of berlin , whose ovens were elongated to accommodate two bodies , slid inside from the back side these furnaces , based around a design commonly used for hospital incinerators , instead vented the gasses down through a series of ducts embedded in the floor , with the help of a draft fan located at the far end of the structure once outside , the gasses then rose through a free standing chimney , most notable for the fact that it was not directly attached to the structure of the building itself , nor had a visible duct leading into it many countries where burial is traditional saw cremation rise to become a significant , if not the most common way of disposing of a dead body - designing a place for goodbye : the architecture of crematoria in the netherlands - jan 2012 starting in the 1960s , cremation has become more common than burial in several countries where the latter is traditional modern cremators automatically monitor their interior to tell when the cremation process is complete and have a spyhole so that an operator can see inside code of cremation practice , doncaster : cemeteries , crematorium , retrieved 26 november 2009 therefore , in the united kingdom , bodies are cremated in the same coffin that they are placed in at the undertaker 's , although the regulations allow the use of an approved '' cover '' during the funeral service when cremation is finished , the remains are passed through a magnetic field to remove any metal , which will be interred elsewhere in the crematorium grounds or , increasingly , recycled the ashes are entered into a cremulator to further grind the remains down into a finer texture before being given to relatives or loved ones or scattered in the crematorium grounds where facilities exist a piece of fire clay with a number on it is used for identifying the remains of the dead body after burning the process usually takes 90 minutes to two hours , with larger bodies taking a longer time although pulverisation may also be performed by hand the appearance of cremated remains after grinding is one of the reasons they are called ashes , although a non-technical term sometimes used is '' cremains '' , a portmanteau of '' cremated '' and '' remains '' ( the cremation association of north america prefers that the word '' cremains '' not be used for referring to '' human cremated remains '' the reason given is that '' cremains '' is thought to have less connection with the deceased , whereas a loved one 's '' cremated remains '' has a more identifiable human connection the ash remaining represents very roughly 3.5 % of the body 's original mass ( 2.5 % in children ) ( if they are missed at first , they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete , as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground after the remains are processed , smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings , and rings ( commonly known as gleanings ) are sieved out and may be later interred in common , consecrated ground in a remote area of the cemetery cremated remains are returned to the next of kin in different manners according to custom and country the basic sealed plastic container bag may be contained within a further cardboard box or velvet sack , or they may be contained within an urn if the family had already purchased one an official certificate of cremation prepared under the authority of the crematorium accompanies the remains , and if required by law , the permit for disposition of human remains , which must remain with the cremated remains cremated remains can be kept in an urn , stored in a special memorial building ( columbarium ) , buried in the ground at many locations or sprinkled on a special field , mountain , or in the sea in addition , there are several services in which the cremated remains will be scattered in a variety of ways and locations one service sends a lipstick-tube sized sample of the cremated remains into low earth orbit , where they remain for years ( but not permanently ) before reentering the atmosphere cremated remains may also be incorporated , with urn and cement , into part of an artificial reef , or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased some individuals use a very small amount of the remains in tattoo ink , for remembrance portraits a portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry , or even blown into special glass keepsakes and glass orbs most cemeteries will grant permission for burial of cremated remains in occupied cemetery plots that have already been purchased or are in use by the families disposing of the cremated remains without any additional charge or oversight in japan and taiwan , the remaining bone fragments are given to the family and are used in a burial ritual before final interment aside from religious reasons ( discussed below ) , some people find they prefer cremation over traditional burial for personal reasons these people view a traditional ground burial as an unneeded complication of their funeral process , and thus choose cremation to make their services as simple as possible this is because with a burial funeral one would have to plan for more transportation services for the body as well as embalming and other body preservation methods generally speaking , cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service , especially if direct cremation is chosen , in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services however , for some even cremation is still relatively expensive , especially as a lot of fuel is required to perform it survivors relocating to another city or country have the option of transporting the remains of their loved ones with the ultimate goal of being interred or scattered together some religions , such as catholic church , require the burial or entombment of cremated remains , but burial of cremated remains may often be accomplished in the burial plot of another person , such as a family member , without any additional cost some persons choose to have a small part of their ashes ( usually less than 1 part in 1000 , because of cost constraints ) scattered in space ( known as space burial and offered by companies such as elysium space , celestis and ascending memories ) despite being an obvious source of carbon emissions , cremation also has environmental advantages over burial , depending on local practice studies by elisabeth keijzer for the netherlands organisation for applied research found that cremation has less of an environmental impact than a traditional burial ( the study did not address natural burials ) , while the newer method of alkaline hydrolysis ( sometimes called green cremation or resomation ) had less impact than both the study was based on dutch practice ; american crematoria are more likely to emit mercury , but are less likely to burn hardwood coffins keijzer 's studies also found that a cremation or burial accounts for only about a quarter of a funeral 's environmental impact ; the carbon emissions of people travelling to the funeral are far greater the environmental impact may be reduced by using cremators for longer periods , and relaxing the requirement for a cremation to take place on the same day that the coffin is received , which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions burial is a known source of certain environmental contaminants , with the major ones being formaldehyde and the coffin itself another environmental concern is that traditional burial takes up a great deal of space in a traditional burial , the body is buried in a casket made from a variety of materials in the united states , the casket is often placed inside a concrete vault or liner before burial in the ground while individually this may not take much room , combined with other burials , it can over time cause serious space concerns the cremated remains are available for the owner to pick up in seven to ten business days authorities had difficulties dealing with the large numbers of bodies , and as a result , thousands of bodies were cremated together out of fear that decaying bodies would cause disease this meant that the bodies of tourists from other asian nations , such as japan and south korea , were mass cremated , rather than being returned to their country of origin for funeral rites
