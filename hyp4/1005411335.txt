in 1956 , william shockley opened shockley semiconductor laboratory as a division of beckman instruments in mountain view , california ; his plan was to develop a new type of '' 4-layer diode '' that would work faster and have more uses than then-current transistors shockley then founded the core of the new company with what he considered the best and brightest graduates coming out of american engineering schools a core group of shockley employees , later known as the traitorous eight , became unhappy with his management of the company looking for funding on their own project , they turned to sherman fairchild 's fairchild camera and instrument , an eastern u.s in 1957 the fairchild semiconductor division was started with plans to make silicon transistors at a time when germanium was still the most common material for semiconductor use according to sherman fairchild , noyce 's impassioned presentation of his vision was the reason sherman fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the traitorous eight noyce advocated the use of silicon as substrate & nbsp ; – since the material costs would consist of sand and a few fine wires , the major cost would be in the manufacturing process the first batch of 100 was sold to ibm for 150 a piece in order to build the computer for the b-70 bomber hoerni 's 2n1613 was a major success , with fairchild licensing the design across the industry in 1960 , fairchild built a circuit with four transistors on a single wafer of silicon , thereby creating the first silicon integrated circuit ( texas instruments ' jack kilby had developed an integrated circuit made of germanium on september 12 , 1958 , and was awarded a u.s by 1965 , fairchild 's process improvements had brought low-cost manufacturing to the semiconductor industry & nbsp ; – making fairchild nearly the only profitable semiconductor manufacturer in the united states fairchild had not done well in the digital integrated circuit market in 1966 , fairchild 's sales were second to those of texas instruments , followed in third place by motorola the semiconductor division , situated in mountain view and palo alto , california , was actually managed by executives from syosset , new york , who visited the california sites once a year , even though the semiconductor division earned most of the profits of the company fairchild 's president at that time , john carter , had used all the profits to fund acquisitions of unprofitable ventures actually , lamond had previously assembled a team of fairchild managers in preparation to defect to plessey , a british company when negotiations with plessey broke down over stock options , lamond and sporck succumbed to widlar 's and talbert 's ( who were already employed at national semiconductor ) suggestion that they look to national semiconductor , ; page 260 widlar and talbert had earlier left fairchild to join molectro , which was later acquired by national semiconductor vadász , who took with them the revolutionary silicon gate ( sgt ) , recently created in the fairchild r & d laboratory by federico faggin who also designed the fairchild 3708 , the world ’ s first commercial mos integrated circuit using sgt many of the original founders , otherwise known as the '' fairchildren '' , had left fairchild in the 1960s to form companies that grew to prominence in the 1970s robert noyce and gordon moore were among the last of the original founders to leave , at which point the brain-drain of talents that had fueled the growth of the company was complete in 1973 , fairchild became the first company to produce a commercial charge-coupled device ( ccd ) following its invention at bell labs digital image sensors are still produced today at their descendant company , fairchild imaging in 1979 , fairchild camera and instrument was purchased by schlumberger limited , an oil field services company , for 425 million fairchild research developed the clipper architecture , a 32-bit risc-like computer architecture , in the 1980s , resulting in the shipping of the c100 chip in 1986 the technology was later sold to intergraph , its main customer the sale did not include fairchild 's test division , which designed and produced automated test equipment ( ate ) for the semiconductor manufacturing industry , nor did it include schlumberger palo alto research fairchild carried with it what was mostly the standard products group previously segregated by gil amelio in december 1998 , fairchild announced the acquisition of samsung 's power division , which made power mosfets , igbts , etc on march 19 , 2001 , fairchild semiconductor announced that it had completed the acquisition of intersil corporation 's discrete power business for approximately 338 million in cash
