acute pain can often be managed using analgesics however , conduction anesthesia may be preferable because of superior pain control and fewer side effects for purposes of pain therapy , la drugs are often given by repeated injection or continuous infusion through a catheter low doses of la drugs can be sufficient so that muscle weakness does not occur and patients may be mobilized though it can be easily performed , repeated local anaesthetic blocks in chronic pain conditions are not recommended as there is no evidence of long-term benefits virtually every part of the body can be anesthetized using conduction anesthesia topical anesthesia , in the form of lidocaine/prilocaine ( emla ) is most commonly used to enable relatively painless venipuncture ( blood collection ) and placement of intravenous cannulae this could be caused by a variety of reasons including trauma during injection , infection , an allergic reaction , haematoma or injection of irritating solutions such as cold-sterilisation solutions usually there is tissue swelling at the point of injection the duration of soft tissue anaesthesia is longer than pulpal anaesthesia and is often associated with difficulty eating , drinking and speaking there is risk of accidental damage to local blood vessels during injection of the local anaesthetic solution thorough evaluation of the disease should be carried out to assess potential risk to the patient as in significant liver dysfunction , the half-life of amide local anaesthetic agents may be drastically increased thus increasing the risk of overdose however , toxicity usually occurs only at plasma levels which are rarely reached if proper anesthetic techniques are adhered to high plasma levels might arise , for example , when doses intended for epidural or intrasupport tissue administration are accidentally delivered as intravascular injection depending on local tissue concentrations of local anesthetics , excitatory or depressant effects on the central nervous system may occur such tissue concentrations may be due to very high plasma levels after intravenous injection of a large dose another possibility is direct exposure of the central nervous system through the cerebrospinal fluid , i.e even levobupivacaine and ropivacaine ( single-enantiomer derivatives ) , developed to ameliorate cardiovascular side effects , still harbor the potential to disrupt cardiac function despite this , risks of toxicity may be higher in pregnancy due to an increase in unbound fraction of local anesthetic and physiological changes increase the transfer of local anesthetic into the central nervous system hence , it is recommended that pregnant women use a lower dose of local anesthetic to reduce any potential complications evidence indicates intralipid , a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion , can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anesthetic overdose , including human case reports of successful use in this way ( lipid rescue ) though most reports to date have used intralipid , a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion , other emulsions , such as liposyn and medialipid , have also been shown effective home-made lipid rescue kit although lipid rescue mechanism of action is not completely understood , the added lipid in the blood stream may act as a sink , allowing for the removal of lipophilic toxins from affected tissues local anesthetic drugs bind more readily to sodium channels in an activated state , thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in rapidly firing neurons a number of methods can be used to decrease this pain , including buffering of the solution with bicarbonate and warming clinical techniques include : surface anesthesia is the application of an la spray , solution , or cream to the skin or a mucous membrane ; the effect is short lasting and is limited to the area of contact plexus anesthesia is injection of la in the vicinity of a nerve plexus , often inside a tissue compartment that limits the diffusion of the drug away from the intended site of action epidural anesthesia is an la injected into the epidural space , where it acts primarily on the spinal nerve roots ; depending on the site of injection and the volume injected , the anesthetized area varies from limited areas of the abdomen or chest to large regions of the body intravenous regional anesthesia ( bier 's block ) is when blood circulation of a limb is interrupted using a tourniquet ( a device similar to a blood-pressure cuff ) , then a large volume of la is injected into a peripheral vein as vazirani-akinosi is a local anaesthetic technique which requires penetration of a significant thickness of soft tissues , a long needle is used presence of systemic health problems ili utilization is expected to increase because dental patients prefer fewer soft tissue anesthesia and dentists aim to reduce administration of traditional inferior alveolar nerve block ( inab ) for routine restorative procedures disadvantages : risk of temporary periodontal tissue damage , likelihood of bacteriemia and endocarditis for at-risk populations , appropriate pressure and correct needle placement are imperative for anesthetic success , short duration of pulpal anesthesia limits the use of ilis for several restorative procedures that require longer duration , postoperative discomfort , and injury on unerupted teeth such as enamel hypoplasia and defects this thereby results in enhanced hydrodynamic diffusion of solution into bone or the target area of deposition , thus permitting larger amounts of anesthetic solution to be delivered during ilis without increased tissue damage things to note : ilis are not recommended for patients with active periodontal inflammation gow-gates technique is used to provide anesthetics to the mandible of the patient 's mouth one study found that out of 1,200 patients receiving injections through the gow-gate technique , only 2 of them did not obtain complete anesthesia : lidocaine/prilocaine ( emla , eutectic mixture of local anesthetic ) lidocaine/tetracaine ( rapydan ) tac la solutions for injection are sometimes mixed with vasoconstrictors ( combination drug ) to increase the duration of local anesthesia by constricting the blood vessels , thereby safely concentrating the anesthetic agent for an extended duration , as well as reducing hemorrhage the commonly held belief that la with vasoconstrictor can cause necrosis in extremities such as the nose , ears , fingers , and toes ( due to constriction of end arteries ) , is invalidated , since no case of necrosis has been reported since the introduction of commercial lidocaine with epinephrine in 1948 hall , in the united states in 1885 described an intraoral anaesthetic technique of blocking the inferior alveolar nerve and the antero-superior dental nerve using 4 % cocaine { shortly after the first use of cocaine for topical anesthesia , blocks on peripheral nerves were described the search for the most effective and least traumatic approach for plexus anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks continues to this day in recent decades , continuous regional anesthesia using catheters and automatic pumps has evolved as a method of pain therapy this technique is still in use and is remarkably safe when drugs of low systemic toxicity such as prilocaine are used spinal anesthesia was first used in 1885 , but not introduced into clinical practice until 1899 , when august bier subjected himself to a clinical experiment in which he observed the anesthetic effect , but also the typical side effect of postpunctural headache within a few years , spinal anesthesia became widely used for surgical anesthesia and was accepted as a safe and effective technique with the advent of thin , flexible catheters , continuous infusion and repeated injections have become possible , making epidural anesthesia still a highly successful technique
