often what drives the plot is the hero 's need to find the object and use it for good , before the villain can use it for evil , or if the object has been broken by the villains , to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it , or , if the object itself is evil , to destroy it however , as british classical scholar nick lowe puts it : '' tolkien , on the whole , gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring 's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring 's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa a frequently used plot mechanism in romances and dramas is a '' love triangle , where two men try to get the same woman another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance '' this contrasts with , for example , the one ring from the lord of the rings , whose very nature is essential to the entire story thus macguffins , according to lucas , are important to the characters and plot in normal usage , when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that 's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously a plot voucher , as defined by nick lowe , is an object given to a character ( especially to the protagonist ) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object the typical example is in whodunits , in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer , when it is actually another character
