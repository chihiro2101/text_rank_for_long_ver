the formation of geopolymers in this way accounts for the large molecular weights and diverse chemical compositions associated with kerogen this polymerization usually happens alongside the formation and/or sedimentation of one or more mineral components resulting in a sedimentary rock like oil shale resulting changes in the burial temperatures and pressures lead to further changes in kerogen composition including loss of hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur , and their associated functional groups , and subsequent isomerization and aromatization such changes are indicative of the thermal maturity state of kerogen during the process of maturity ( geology ) , kerogen breaks down in high-temperature pyrolysis reactions to form lower-molecular-weight products including bitumen , oil , and gas its chemical composition varies substantially between and even within sedimentary formations kerogen is insoluble in normal organic solvents in part because of its high molecular mass of its component compounds & nbsp ; 150–200 & nbsp ; °c , both depending on how quickly the source rock is heated ) some types of kerogen release crude oil or natural gas , collectively known as hydrocarbons ( fossil fuels ) the chemical composition of kerogen has been analyzed by several forms of solid state spectroscopy these experiments typically measure the speciations ( bonding environments ) of different types of atoms in kerogen nmr experiments have found that carbon in kerogen can range from almost entirely aliphatic ( orbital hybridisation sp3 ) to almost entirely aromatic ( orbital hybridisation sp2 ) , with kerogens of higher thermal maturity typically having higher abundance of aromatic carbon it is found that the oxygen content of kerogen decreases during thermal maturation ( as has also been observed by elemental analysis ) , with relatively little observable change in oxygen speciation overall , changes in kerogen composition with respect to heteroatom chemistry occur predominantly at low thermal maturities ( bitumen and oil windows ) , while changes with respect to carbon chemistry occur predominantly at high thermal maturities ( oil and gas windows ) analysis by gas sorption demonstrated that the internal specific surface area of kerogen increases by an order of magnitude ( ~ 40 to 400 m 2 /g ) during thermal maturation this variation in starting material may lead to variations in composition between different kerogen particles , leading to spatial heterogeneity in kerogen composition at the micron length scale heterogeneity between kerogen particles may also arise from local variations in catalysis of pyrolysis reactions due to the nature of the minerals surrounding different particles the van krevelen diagram is one method of classifying kerogen by 'types ' , where kerogens form distinct groups when the ratios of hydrogen to carbon and oxygen to carbon are compared on a mass basis , rocks containing type i kerogen yield the largest quantity of hydrocarbons upon pyrolysis
