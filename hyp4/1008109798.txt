in addition to the laboratory module , the complete set also included five external pallets for experiments in vacuum built by british aerospace ( bae ) and a pressurized igloo containing the subsystems needed for the pallet-only flight configuration operation the system had some unique features including an intended two-week turn-around time ( for the original space shuttle launch turn-around time ) and the roll-on-roll-off for loading in aircraft ( earth-transportation ) spacelab consisted of a variety of interchangeable components , with the major one being a crewed laboratory that could be flown in space shuttle orbiter 's bay and returned to earth however , the habitable module did not have to be flown to conduct a spacelab-type mission and there was a variety of pallets and other hardware supporting space research the habitable module expanded the volume for astronauts to work in a shirt-sleeve environment and had space for equipment racks and related support equipment when the habitable module was not used , some of the support equipment for the pallets could be housed in the smaller igloo , a pressurized cylinder connected to the space shuttle orbiter crew area the spacelab module comprises a cylindrical main laboratory configurable as short or long module flown in the rear of the space shuttle cargo bay , connected to the crew compartment by a tunnel when the habitable module was not used , but additional space was needed for support equipment another structure called the igloo could be used it was also possible to operate spacelab experiments from the space shuttle orbiter aft flight deck ips was used on three different space shuttle missions between 1985 and 1995 ips would be mounted inside the payload bay of the space shuttle orbiter , and could provide gimbaled 3-axis pointing examples of spacelab components or hardware : eva airlock tunnel tunnel adapter igloo spacelab module forward end cone aft end cone core segment/module experiment racks experiment segment/module electrical ground support equipment mechanical ground support equipment electrical power distribution subsystem command and data management subsystem environmental control subsystem instrument pointing system pallet structure multi-purpose experiment support structure ( mpess ) the extended duration orbiter ( edo ) assembly was not spacelab hardware , strictly speaking also , nasa later used it with the spacehab modules science work was moved to the international space station and spacehab module , a pressurized carrier similar to the spacelab module the spacelab components were used on 32 shuttle missions in total space station freedom space shuttle retirement international space station columbus module columbus man-tended free flyer hermes ( spacecraft ) spacelab , a 1978 song by kraftwerk spacehab module , various , not to be confused with spacelab
