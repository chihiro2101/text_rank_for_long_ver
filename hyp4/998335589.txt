the goal was to integrate components from previous and new government intelligence and surveillance programs , including genoa , genoa ii , genisys , ssna , eeld , wae , tides , communicator , humanid and bio-surveillance , with data mining knowledge gleaned from the private sector to create a resource for the intelligence , counterintelligence , and law enforcement communities to that end , tia was to create a counter-terrorism information system that : increases information coverage by an order of magnitude and affords easy scaling provides focused warnings within an hour after a triggering event occurs or an evidence threshold is passed automatically queues analysts based on partial pattern matches and has patterns that cover 90 % of all previously known foreign terrorist attacks supports collaboration , analytical reasoning and information sharing so that analysts can hypothesize , test and propose theories and mitigating strategies , so decision-makers can effectively evaluate the impact of policies and courses of action genoa 's primary function was intelligence analysis to assist human analysts while genoa primarily focused on intelligence analysis , genoa ii aimed to provide means by which computers , software agents , policymakers , and field operatives could collaborate so they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases , as well as unstructured public data sources , such as the world wide web '' effective analysis across heterogenous databases '' means the ability to take things from databases which are designed to store different types of data—such as a database containing criminal records , a phone call database and a foreign intelligence database another goal was to develop '' a large , distributed system architecture for managing the huge volume of raw data input , analysis results , and feedback , that will result in a simpler , more flexible data store that performs well and allows us to retain important data indefinitely research was also started on foreign-language computer interaction for use in coalition operations gait recognition was a key component of humanid , because it could be employed on low-resolution video feeds and therefore help identify subjects at a distance the university also worked on finding and tracking faces by expressions and speech the university of southampton 's department of electronics and computer science was developing an '' automatic gait recognition '' system and was in charge of compiling a database to test it tia 's genisys component , in addition to integrating and organizing separate databases , was to run an internal '' privacy protection program there were also plans for tia to have an application that could '' anonymize '' data , so that information could be linked to an individual only by court order ( especially for medical records gathered by the bio-surveillance project ) a set of audit logs were to be kept , which would track whether innocent americans ' communications were getting caught up in relevant data sharkey applied the phrase to a conceptual method by which the government could sift through massive amounts of data becoming available via digitization and draw important conclusions late that year , the information awareness office awarded the science applications international corporation ( saic ) a 19 million contract to develop the '' information awareness prototype system '' , the core architecture to integrate all of tia 's information extraction , analysis , and dissemination tools groove made it possible for analysts from many different agencies to share intelligence data instantly , and linked specialized programs that were designed to look for patterns of suspicious behavior on 24 january 2003 , the united states senate voted to limit tia by restricting its ability to gather information from emails and the commercial databases of health , financial and travel companies 108-7 , division m , § 111 ( b ) passed in february , the defense department was given 90 days to compile a report laying out a schedule of tia 's development and the intended use of allotted funds or face a cutoff of support it disclosed that the program 's computer tools were still in their preliminary testing phase also in may , total information awareness was renamed terrorism information awareness in an attempt to stem the flow of criticism on its information-gathering practices on average citizens at some point in early 2003 , the national security agency began installing access nodes on tia 's classified network the total information awareness project lives on , mit technology review , 26 april 2006 , retrieved 16 june 2016 most of the original project goals and research findings were preserved , but the privacy protection mechanics were abandoned genoa ii , which focused on collaboration between machines and humans , was renamed '' topsail '' and handed over to the nsa 's advanced research and development activity , or arda ( arda was later moved to the director of national intelligence 's control as the disruptive technologies office ) in early 2006 a spokesman for the air force research laboratory said that topsail was '' in the process of being canceled due to lack of funds in the 2008 british television series the last enemy , tia is portrayed as a uk-based surveillance database that can be used to track and monitor anybody by putting all available government information in one place .
