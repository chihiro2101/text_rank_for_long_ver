she was first offered a post as assistant to a young hairdresser named lametz ; jeanne had a brief relationship with him that may have produced a daughter , although it is highly improbable on the instigation of a gomard ( possibly the brother of her supposed father ) , jeanne was then employed as a companion ( dame de compagnie ) to an elderly widow , madame de la garde , but was sent away when again , her youth and beauty went against her giving her the appellation of mademoiselle lange , du barry helped establish jeanne 's career as a courtesan in the highest circles of parisian society ;
