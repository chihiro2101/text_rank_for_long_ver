this had been considered from the early 1950s and the planned solution was a move to the blue streak medium range ballistic missile , but this suffered extensive delays for a variety of reasons among many possibilities , the raf eventually selected the blue steel standoff missile to allow its bombers to fire their weapons while still ( hopefully ) outside the range of the defensive fighters a better solution came along in the form of the us 's agm-48 skybolt missile one key part of the agreement was that the uk would develop their own warheads for the missiles , as the uk military and political establishments were rather worried about losing their own nuclear production and design capability having already put some effort into the skybolt warhead , it was decided to adapt this design , based on the thermonuclear secondary of the us w59 , matched to a primary trigger based on a wholly uk design developed from the cleo device tested at the pampas ugt instead of the w58 used on us navy missiles developing an abm system was largely an engineering issue , requiring radars with high resolution and targeting computers that could adjust trajectories fast enough given an approach speed in thousands of miles an hour in the end the us abandoned antelope because they could achieve the same ends simply by throwing additional warheads , which was becoming increasingly inexpensive with the introduction of mirvs this meant that all three could be attacked by a single abm with a large warhead as the uk had not yet received their missiles , they agreed to use the a3t version as it required relatively few other changes the only good news for the uk in this development was that it clearly defined the problem they were facing ; their attacks had to be able to credibly defeat a 100-interceptor abm defence around moscow this would require a fleet of at least five submarines to keep two on station at all times , as well as larger crew complements , training and logistics support , and appeared to be the most expensive option among these were '' topsy '' , the a3t missile the uk had already agreed to use this option also had the advantage of maintaining commonality with the us navy , as well as offering greater range , and thus increasing the safety of the launch submarines the us also favoured the poseidon , although for more technical reasons this would require a much faster-reacting radar and computer system than an abm using a long-range interceptor , one that could safely wait until only a few moments before detonation , but this was by no means impossible and was part of the us 's own abm systems as the uk had decided to produce its own warheads and bus , this option would require considerable development effort in order to produce a new mirv bus of their own although in theory the uk might be able to use the us-designed bus , these options were being explored in the midst of the abm treaty , and it was not clear whether the treaty might forbid this technology being transferred in the end the higher levels of the british political system decided against the urgings of their own chiefs of staff and went with the penaid approach on the existing a3t missile a new review again concluded that the project should continue , even though the naval staff continued to be opposed reduced missile range had the effect of reducing the sea-room in which the british submarines could hide this was a serious problem , because much of natos anti-submarine strategy was based on closing the gap , with the implicit assumption that areas north of it would be fairly easy for soviet submarines to operate within if the polaris fleet was forced to operate to the north of the line , or even within a limited distance of it , they would be lacking the protection of the bulk of the nato forces , and potentially in the midst of a high concentration of enemy hunter-killer subs efforts were made to reduce warhead weight by substituting a new , smaller , high-yielding thermonuclear primary tested at fondutta ugt and quargel ugt , and although these tests were deemed successful , the delays involved in preparing them for chevaline were thought to risk further unacceptable delays to the in-service date planned , and they were not used to keep the polaris missile in use in the uk meant that some production lines had to be re-opened at great cost to supply a very small force although the papers will not be declassified for some time yet , it seems likely that the naval staff made the same case with trident with some success when their influence was at its height after the falklands war the us later decided to move primary development from the c4 to the larger trident d5 , a much more capable missile , but one that would not fit into the latest s , let alone the older the system was not a mirving system because the target of both warheads was one location , about which the two warheads were spread , as in the earlier mrv system of polaris a3t in the case of an attack on the ussr , even a single resolution could have ensured the destruction of a significant portion of the soviet command and control structure given all sixteen missiles launching successfully , an abm system would be presented with 551 credible-looking targets to deal with whilst the fully assembled chevaline reb and a new warhead was of identical external shape , and balance to us polaris rvs to minimise development costs and avoid the need for full-scale flight testing , the chevaline reb was unusual in using a new material known as 3-dimensional quartz phenolic ( 3dqp ) , public record office , london
