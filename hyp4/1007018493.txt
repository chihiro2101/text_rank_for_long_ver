in 1966 , the soviet luna 9 became the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to earth lander vikram on chandrayaan-2 , a maiden soft landing effort by the indian space research organization , lost contact to control on 6 september 2019 , some minutes before landing the soviet vega program also placed two balloons in the venusian atmosphere in 1985 , which were the first aerial tools on other planets the soviet union 's mars 1962b became the first earth-based mission intended to impact on mars in 1962 in 1971 , the lander of the mars 3 probe conducted the first soft landing on mars , but communication was lost within a minute after touchdown , which occurred during one of the worst global dust storms since the beginning of telescopic observations of the red planet three other landers , mars 2 in 1971 and mars 5 and mars 6 in 1973 , either crashed or failed to even enter the planet 's atmosphere the soviet union planned the heavy marsokhod mars 4nm mission in 1973 and the mars sample return mars 5nm mission in 1975 , but neither occurred due to needing the n1 ( rocket ) that was never flown successfully a double-launching soviet mars 5m ( mars-79 ) sample return mission was planned for 1979 but cancelled due to complexity and technical problems mars pathfinder was part of the canceled mars environmental survey program with a set of 16 landers planned for 1999–2009 the mars polar lander ceased communication on 3 december 1999 prior to reaching the surface and is presumed to have crashed the european beagle 2 lander deployed successfully from the mars express spacecraft but the signal confirming a landing which should have come on 25 december 2003 was not received exploration of mars including the use of landers continues to this day since 2007 the canadian space agency has considered a mission to phobos called phobos reconnaissance and international mars exploration ( prime ) , which would include an orbiter and lander the first landing on a small solar system body ( an object in the solar system that is not a moon , planet , or dwarf planet ) was performed in 2001 by the probe near shoemaker at asteroid 433 eros despite the fact that near was not originally designed to be capable of landing designed to rendezvous and land on a low-gravity body , hayabusa became the second spacecraft to land on an asteroid , and in 2010 the first sample return mission from an asteroid japan ( jaxa ) launched the hayabusa2 asteroid space probe in 2014 to deliver several landing parts ( including minerva ii and german mobile asteroid surface scout ( mascot ) landers and a small carry-on impactor ( sci ) penetrator ) in 2018–2019 to return samples to earth by 2020 launched in october 2018 and expected to reach mercury in december 2025 , esa 's bepicolombo mission to mercury was originally designed to include the mercury surface element ( mse ) currently , the esa is planning to launch the jupiter icy moon explorer ( juice ) mission in 2022 , which includes the russian ganymede lander making a soft landing on ganymede around 2033 despite the high radiation environment around europa and jupiter , which would cause issues for robotic surface missions , europa lander ( nasa ) mission is still under consideration and there is steady lobbying for future missions however , the mission failed with the loss of its mother ship , mars polar lander , which lost communication with earth during entry into mars ' atmosphere on 3 december 1999 the nasa messenger ( mercury surface , space environment , geochemistry , and ranging ) mission to mercury launched on 3 august 2004 and entered orbit around the planet on 18 march 2011 following a mapping mission , messenger was directed to impact mercury 's surface on 30 april 2015
