the largest member of the family , the stone triggerfish ( pseudobalistes naufragium ) reaches , but most species have a maximum length between gill plates ( opercula ) , although present , are also not visible , overlaid by the tough skin , covered with rough , rhomboid scales that form a stout armor on their bodies as a protection against predation , triggerfish can erect the first two dorsal spines : the first ( anterior ) spine is locked in place by erection of the short second spine , and can be unlocked only by depressing the second , “ trigger ” spine , hence the family name “ triggerfish ” the rather bizarre anatomy of the triggerfishes reflects their typical diet of slow-moving , bottom dwelling crustaceans , mollusks , sea urchins and other echinoderms , generally creatures with protective shells and spines many will also take small fishes and some , notably the members of the genus melichthys , feed on algae some triggerfish species can be quite aggressive when guarding their eggs their territory extends in a cone from the nest toward the surface , so swimming upwards can put a diver further into the fishes ' territory ; a horizontal swim away from the nest site is best when confronted by an angry triggerfish unlike the relatively small picasso triggerfish , the titan triggerfish poses a serious threat to inattentive divers due to its large size and powerful teeth a male 's territory is used for spawning and parental care a male and female blow water on the sandy bottom ( usually in the same spot at the same time ) and set up their egg site during actual spawning , eggs are laid on the sandy sea bottom ( triggerfish are demersal spawners despite their large size ) triggerfish eggs are usually very small ( diameter of 0.5–0.6 mm ) and are easily spread by waves a female triggerfish stays near the spawning ground , around 5 m off the bottom , and guards the eggs within her territory against intruders a male triggerfish stays farther above the eggs and guards all the females and eggs in his territory
