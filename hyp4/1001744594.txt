the basal metabolic rate of flighted species is much higher than that of flightless terrestrial birds this shows flight to be generally necessary for survival and dispersal in birds one hypothesis suggests that as predation pressure decreases on islands with low raptor species richness and no mammalian predators , the need for large , powerful flight muscles that make for a quick escape decreases moreover , raptor species tend to become generalist predators on islands with low species richness , as opposed to specializing in the predation of birds ostriches have only two toes , with one being much larger than the other ostriches and rheas have prominent wings ; although they do n't use them to fly , they do use them in courtship and predator distraction kiwis are exceptions to this trend , and possess proportionally larger brains comparable to those of parrots and songbirds , though evidence for similar advanced cognitive skills is currently lacking emus have tracts of length , and have a more omnivorous diet , including insects and other small animals moas and elephant birds were the largest native herbivores in their faunas , far larger than contemporary herbivorous mammals in the latter 's case ratites are different from the flying birds in that they needed to adapt or evolve certain features to protect their young kiwis stand out as the exception with extended monogamous reproductive strategies where either the male alone or both sexes incubate a single egg ratites and humans have had a long relationship starting with the use of the egg for water containers , jewelry , or other art medium
