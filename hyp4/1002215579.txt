the results of the first cycle of erosion are seen in the widespread exposure of the resistant carboniferous limestone as a broad platform in the south-western area of greater uplift through central arizona where the higher formations were worn away the most important line of cliffs of this class is associated with the western and southern boundary of the plateau province where it was uplifted from the lower ground it is to this newly introduced cycle of physiographic evolution that the deep canyons of the plateau province are due however the most famous example is the grand canyon of arizona , eroded by the colorado river across the uplifted platform of carboniferous limestone during the current cycle of erosion , several of the faults , whose scarps had been worn away in the previous cycle , have been brought to light again as topography features by the removal of the weak strata along one side of the fault line , leaving the harder strata on the other side in relief a group of large volcanoes occurs on the limestone platform south of the grand canyon , culminating in humphreys peak , a moderately dissected cone , and associated with many more recent smaller cones and freshlooking lava flows the henry mountains in southwestern utah are peculiar in owing their relief to the doming or blistering up of the plateau strata by the underground intrusion of large bodies or cisterns ( laccolites ) of lava , now more or less exposed by erosion many of the intermontane plains , occurring mostly in the north , appear to be heavily aggraded with mountain waste others , mostly in the south , are valleys also heavily aggraded by mountain erosion in the north , where dislocations have invaded the field of the horizontal columbian lavas , as in southeastern oregon and northeastern california , the blocks are monoclinal in structure as well as in attitude this area also has huge alluvial fans , with heads at canyons exiting the mountains , and laterally confluent with adjacent fans as they extend for miles with rather consistent slopes only a small part of the basin and range province is drained to the sea a much larger but still narrow medial area is drained southwestward by the colorado river to the head of the gulf of california , where this large and very turbid river has formed the extensive colorado river delta , north of which the former head of the gulf is now cut off from the sea and laid bare by evaporation as a plain below sea-level the outlines of the eastern lake bonneville and the western lake lahontan water bodies are well recorded by shore lines and deltas on the enclosing slopes , hundreds of feet above the present lake surfaces the abandoned shore lines have yielded evidence of past climatic changes second in importance only to those of the pleistocene glaciated areas the snake river has cut a deeper canyon farther southeast where the plains are higher and has disclosed the many lava sheets which build up the plains , occasionally revealing a buried mountain in which the superposed river has cut an even narrower canyon one of the most remarkable features of the intermediate province is seen in the temporary course taken by the columbia river across the plains , while its canyon was obstructed by pleistocene glaciers that came from the cascade range on the northwest the river followed the temporary course long enough to erode a deep gorge , known as grande coulee , along part of its length along parts of their eastern border , where the rainfall is a little increased by the approach of the westerly winds to the rocky mountains , there is a belt of very deep , impalpably fine soil , supposed to be a dust deposit brought from the drier parts of the plains farther west
