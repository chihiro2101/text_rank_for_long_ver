full automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver ; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor , computer , and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway other potential benefits include improved air quality ( as a result of more-efficient traffic flows ) , increased fuel economy , and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems bpa consists of integrating applications , restructuring labor resources and using software applications throughout the organization bpas can be implemented in a number of business areas including marketing , sales and workflow home automation ( also called domotics ) designates an emerging practice of increased automation of household appliances and features in residential dwellings , particularly through electronic means that allow for things impracticable , overly expensive or simply not possible in recent past decades the rise in the usage of home automation solutions has taken a turn reflecting the increased dependency of people on such automation solutions however , automation has not become widespread in laboratories due to its high cost this may change with the ability of integrating low-cost devices with standard laboratory equipment industrial automation deals primarily with the automation of manufacturing , quality control , and material handling processes industrial automation is to replace the decision making of humans and manual command-response activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands one trend is increased use of machine vision to provide automatic inspection and robot guidance functions , another is a continuing increase in the use of robots semiconductor companies like infineon technologies are offering 8-bit microcontroller applications for example found in motor controls , general purpose pumps , fans , and ebikes to reduce energy consumption and thus increase efficiency originating from germany , industry 4.0 encompasses numerous devices , concepts , and machines , as well as the advancement of the industrial internet of things ( iiot ) '' these new revolutionary advancements have drawn attention to the world of automation in an entirely new light and shown ways for it to grow to increase productivity and efficiency in machinery and manufacturing facilities industry 4.0 works with the iiot and software/hardware to connect in a way that ( through communication technologies ) add enhancements and improve manufacturing processes implementation of systems such as scada is an example of software that takes place in industrial automation today scada is a supervisory data collection software , just one of the many used in industrial automation industrial robots use various mechanical , electrical as well as software systems to allow for high precision , accuracy and speed that far exceed any human performance servos , digital logic and solid-state electronics allowed engineers to build better and faster systems and over time these systems were improved and revised to the point where a single robot is capable of running 24 hours a day with little or no maintenance in 1997 , there were 700,000 industrial robots in use , the number has risen to 1.8m in 2017 in recent years , artificial intelligence ( ai ) with robotics is also used in creating an automatic labeling solution , using robotic arms as the automatic label applicator , and ai for learning and detecting the products to be labelled however , these early computers required specialist programmers and stringent operating environmental control for temperature , cleanliness , and power quality since many industrial processes have timescales easily addressed by millisecond response times , modern ( fast , small , reliable ) electronics greatly facilitate building reliable controllers , and performance could be traded off for reliability the automation would take the information entered into one tool and populate it across the others so it did not have to be entered more than once , for example
