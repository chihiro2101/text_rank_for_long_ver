in the summer of 1793 , the 118,000-strong coalition army punched a gap in the line of french fortresses along the frontier with the austrian netherlands , with the siege of condé concluding on 12 july and the siege of valenciennes on 27 july in the battle of caesar 's camp , the coalition army under prince josias of saxe-coburg-saalfeld hustled the french army of the north out of a position near cambrai on 7 august from 6–8 september , the army of the north under jean nicolas houchard defeated the dunkirk covering force in the battle of hondschoote , compelling the duke of york to give up the siege of dunkirk two french columns attempted to raise the siege but failed , one of the columns being nearly wiped out by coalition cavalry in the battle of avesnes-le-sec though coburg might have easily seized cambrai and bouchain , which had been stripped of their garrisons to form the relief columns , the coalition commander chose to move against maubeuge instead near cassel , dominique vandamme led 8,984 foot soldiers in 19 battalions and 325 horsemen in one regiment , while charles françois filon led 3,705 foot soldiers in nine battalions in a series of skirmishes , the three austrian columns pressed east , finally driving desjardin 's troops into the maubeuge entrenched camp , with losses of 150 men and two cannons coburg split his forces into a 26,000-man siege army directed by the prince of orange and an army of observation on 13 october , the french enjoyed initial success in a sortie against the bois du tilleul , but troops sent out to help mistakenly fired on their own friends and the french were compelled to retreat after the coalition army opened its bombardment on the night of 14 october , the morale of the garrison sank leaving 10,000 soldiers in the camp of gavrelle to support bouchain and cambrai , jourdan immediately moved to the relief of maubeuge with the remaining 20,000 men without waiting for the troops from the north , jourdan assembled a division under jacques fromentin the next day , several units from the north joined beauregard 's division duquesnoy 's division had 10,906 men including 1,960 mounted troops the austrian covering force was entrenched and though clerfayt was in nominal command , coburg was on the scene and in control of the battle this story made the rounds in the french army and made its soldiers eager to make the coalition commander wear trousers on the morning of 15 october , bellegarde held the coalition right flank with about 5,000 troops in three battalions of foot and 16 squadrons of horse far to the east at beaumont , johann andreas benjowsky commanded 4,000 troops organized as three battalions and 12 squadrons near obrechies , four squadrons of austrian cavalry charged them and drove them off , with the loss of three field guns supported by a plentiful artillery , the french infantry drove two austrian battalions out of wattignies , but as the french poured out of the other side of the village they were met by an infantry-cavalry counterattack in the afternoon bellegarde launched a counterattack led by austrian regular infantry , while two regiments of cavalry swept down on the french left flank the army commander planned to wait for the attacks of his two wings to make significant progress before launching the attack of balland 's division finally , jourdan put himself at the head of balland 's division and ordered the assault in the thick of the bullets , jourdan bravely urged his troops on but an austrian force appeared from the direction of saint-aubin , threatening the french left flank believing he was going to be attacked again , coburg reinforced his covering force by five battalions of about 3,750 men and rearranged his defenses the rest of balland 's division was to form line of battle and use its light troops to probe the enemy positions the main attack was also supported by additional artillery more french troops came up and defeated the austrian attack duquesnoy sent gratien 's brigade forward but it was caught by austrian cavalry in the open and thrown back by this time , the french had dragged a battery up to the wattignies heights to support the infantry as the french began breaking into the village , hadik launched attacks from three directions at once , routing beauregard 's men the french abandoned five cannon and fled back to solrinnes the austrian commander-in-chief had plenty of soldiers but the prince of orange denied a request to send any of his soldiers to the south side of the sambre on 17 october , the garrison sent out a column to the south to meet with jourdan , instead of to the north after the retreating coalition forces though there was time for more operations , coburg moved his army into winter quarters while jourdan was with the right wing of the army of the north , the operations of the left wing under davaine failed this was the usual prelude to arrest and execution but jourdan was allowed to return to the army and put his soldiers in winter quarters after reinforcing the army of the west and the army of the moselle each with 10,000 men , time was wasted in denouncing generals duquesnoy , meyer and gudin
