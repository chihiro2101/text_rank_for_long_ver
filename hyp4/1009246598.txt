river deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either ( 1 ) a body of water , such as a lake , ocean , or reservoir , ( 2 ) another river that can not remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation , or ( 3 ) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments the tidal currents also can not be too strong , as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it as a result , sediment drops out of the flow and is deposited as alluvium , which builds up to form the river delta over time , this single channel builds a deltaic lobe ( such as the bird's-foot of the mississippi or ural river deltas ) , pushing its mouth into the standing water as the deltaic lobe advances , the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation ( see slope ) typically , when the river switches channels in this manner , some of its flow remains in the abandoned channel the mississippi and ural river deltas , with their bird's-feet , are examples of rivers that do not avulse often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape most large river deltas discharge to intra-cratonic basins on the trailing edges of passive margins due to the majority of large rivers such as the mississippi , nile , amazon , ganges , indus , yangtze , and yellow river discharging along passive continental margins this phenomenon is due mainly to three factors : topography , basin area , and basin elevation topography along passive margins tend to be more gradual and widespread over a greater area enabling sediment to pile up and accumulate over time to form large river deltas there are many other lesser factors that could explain why the majority of river deltas form along passive margins rather than active margins when sediment does not travel far from the source , sediments that build up are coarser grained and more loosely consolidated , therefore making delta formation more difficult tectonic activity on active margins causes the formation of river deltas to form closer to the sediment source which may affect channel avulsion , delta lobe switching , and auto cyclicity active margin river deltas tend to be much smaller and less abundant but may transport similar amounts of sediment the other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river fluvial-dominated deltas are found in areas of low tidal range and low wave energy where the river water is nearly equal in density to the basin water , the delta is characterized by homopycnal flow , in which the river water rapidly mixes with basin water and abruptly dumps most of its sediment load where the river water has higher density than basin water , typically from a heavy load of sediment , the delta is characterized by hypercynal flow in which the river water hugs the basin bottom as a density current that deposits its sediments as turbidites when the river water is less dense than the basin water , as is typical of river deltas on an ocean coastline , the delta is characterized by hypopycnal flow in which the river water is slow to mix with the denser basin water and spreads out as a surface fan for example , a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta while some authors describe both lacustrine and marine locations of gilbert deltas , others note that their formation is more characteristic of the freshwater lakes , where it is easier for the river water to mix with the lakewater faster ( as opposed to the case of a river falling into the sea or a salt lake , where less dense fresh water brought by the river stays on top longer ) elsewhere , similar structures occur , for example , at the mouths of several creeks that flow into okanagan lake in british columbia and forming prominent peninsulas at naramata , summerland , and peachland in wave dominated deltas , wave-driven sediment transport controls the shape of the delta , and much of the sediment emanating from the river mouth is deflected along the coast line the relationship between waves and river deltas is quite variable and largely influenced by the deepwater wave regimes of the receiving basin waves can also be responsible for carrying sediments away from the river delta , causing the delta to retreat erosion is also an important control in tide-dominated deltas , such as the ganges delta , which may be mainly submarine , with prominent sandbars and ridges other rivers , particularly those on coasts with significant tidal range , do not form a delta but enter into the sea in the form of an estuary foreset beds form the greater part of the bulk of a delta , ( and also occur on the lee side of sand dunes ) jackson , dictionary of geological terms agi ( 1984 ) the sediment particles within foreset beds consist of larger and more variable sizes , and constitute the bed load that the river moves downstream by rolling and bouncing along the channel bottom as the river channels meander laterally across the top of the delta , the river is lengthened and its gradient is reduced , causing the suspended load to settle out in nearly horizontal beds over the delta 's top finding deltas is a major sign that mars once had large amounts of
