sodium carbonate decahydrate ( na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o ) , also known as washing soda , is the most common hydrate of sodium carbonate containing 10 molecules of water of crystallization it is one of the few metal carbonate which are soluble in water some common applications of sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) include : sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) is used as a cleansing agent for domestic purposes like washing clothes sodium carbonate is a component of many dry soap powders sodium carbonate serves as a flux for silica , lowering the melting point of the mixture to something achievable without special materials hard water contains dissolved compounds , usually calcium or magnesium compounds sodium carbonate is used for removing temporary and permanent hardness of water sodium carbonate is also used as a relatively strong base in various fields sodium ( nahco 3 ) or baking soda , also a component in fire extinguishers , is often generated from sodium carbonate although nahco 3 is itself an intermediate product of the solvay process , the heating needed to remove the ammonia that contaminates it decomposes some nahco 3 , making it more economic to react finished na 2 co 3 with co 2 : : na 2 co 3 + co 2 + h 2 o → 2nahco 3 in a related reaction , sodium carbonate is used to make sodium bisulfite ( nahso 3 ) , which is used for the '' sulfite '' method of separating lignin from cellulose sodium carbonate is used by the cotton industry to neutralize the sulfuric acid needed for acid delinting of fuzzy cottonseed sodium carbonate is used by the brick industry as a wetting agent to reduce the amount of water needed to extrude the clay sodium carbonate is used in toothpastes , where it acts as a foaming agent and an abrasive , and to temporarily increase mouth ph sodium carbonate is also used in the processing and tanning of animal hides the anhydrous mineral form of sodium carbonate is quite rare and called natrite the sodium carbonate concentration in soda ash varied very widely , from 2–3 percent for the seaweed-derived form ( '' kelp '' ) , to 30 percent for the best barilla produced from saltwort plants in spain plant and seaweed sources for soda ash , and also for the related alkali '' potash '' , became increasingly inadequate by the end of the 18th century , and the search for commercially viable routes to synthesizing soda ash from salt and other chemicals intensified the hydrochloric acid produced by the leblanc process was a major source of air pollution , and the calcium sulfide byproduct also presented waste disposal issues the process is substantially more economical than the leblanc process , which generates two waste products , calcium sulfide and hydrogen chloride the second step of the solvay process , heating sodium bicarbonate , is used on a small scale by home cooks and in restaurants to make sodium carbonate for culinary purposes ( including pretzels and alkali noodles ) the method is appealing to such users because sodium bicarbonate is widely sold as baking soda , and the temperatures required to to convert baking soda to sodium carbonate are readily achieved in conventional kitchen ovens american natural soda ash company international chemical safety card 1135 fmc wyoming corporation use of sodium carbonate in dyeing sodium carbonate manufacturing by synthetic processes soda ash light overview , manufacturing method and applications soda ash market- industry analysis and forecast
