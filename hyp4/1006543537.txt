the name derives from '' bone hill '' , likely linked to occasional burials from at least saxon times , but more probably derives from the use for mass-deposit for human bones—amounting to over 1,000 cartloads—brought from st paul 's charnel house in 1549 ( when that building was demolished ) in keeping with this tradition , in 1665 the city of london corporation decided to use some of the land as a common burial ground for the interment of bodies of inhabitants who had died of the plague and could not be accommodated in the churchyards outer walls were completed but church of england officials never consecrated the ground nor used it for burials an inscription at the eastern entrance gate to the burial ground reads : '' this church-yard was inclosed with a brick wall at the sole charges of the city of london , in the mayoralty of sir john lawrence , , anno domini 1665 ; and afterwards the gates thereof were built and finished in the mayoralty of thomas bloodworth , knt william maitland , the history and survey of london from its foundation to the present time ( london , 1756 ) , p in 1852 the burial act was passed which enabled grounds to be closed once they became full an order for closure for bunhill fields was made in december 1853 , and the final burial ( that of elizabeth howell oliver ) took place on 5 january 1854 two decades before , a group of city nonconformists led by george collison bought a site for a new landscaped alternative , at part of abney park in stoke newington in the 1950s , after some debate , the city ordered : to clear the northern third ( the projection ) of the site of most of its monuments to open it as a public garden ; and to preserve and protect the rest behind railings bunyan 's monument lies at the broadwalk 's southern end , and that to defoe at its northern end , while blake 's headstone was moved from the site of his grave and repositioned next to defoe , alongside the headstone to the lesser-known joseph swain ( d this arrangement survives , but in 2018 a second monument to blake was placed on the actual site of his grave he was initially buried in the '' baptist corner '' at the back of the burial ground , on the understanding that his remains would be moved into the family vault of his friend john strudwick when that was next opened for a burial there is no certain evidence as to when ( or even if ) this was done : the probability , however , is that it occurred when strudwick himself died in 1695 , and certainly bunyan 's name was inscribed on the side of the monument by the 19th century , this had fallen into decay , but in the period following the closure of the burial ground a public appeal for its restoration was launched under the presidency of the 7th earl of shaftesbury this work was completed in may 1862 , and comprised a complete reconstruction of the monument , undertaken by the sculptor edgar george papworth senior ( 1809–1866 ) in 1869 , james clarke , editor of the christian world children 's newspaper , launched an appeal for subscriptions to place a more suitable memorial on the grave william blake—painter , poet , printmaker and visionary—died in august 1827 and was buried in the northern part of the burial ground his wife , catherine blake , died in october 1831 and was buried in a separate grave on the south side of the ground by the 20th century , blake 's grave was in disrepair ; and in 1927 , for the centenary of his death and at a time when his reputation was on the rise , a new headstone was commissioned the headstone was therefore moved approximately 20 & nbsp ; metres to its present location , next to the monument to daniel defoe joseph swain 's headstone was added to the grouping at the same time , although that faces west in 2006–07 , members of the group the friends of william blake established the original location of his grave , and proposed placing a new memorial there baptist minister john rippon—who was himself buried at the site in 1836—made transcripts of its monumental inscriptions in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , some copied while '' laying on his side '' john conder ( 1714–1781 ) , president of homerton college james coningham ( 1670–1716 ) , presbyterian divine and tutor thomas cotton ( 1653–1730 ) , dissenting minister cromwell family : two tombs commemorate various 18th-century members of this family , including hannah cromwell née hewling ( 1653–1732 ) , widow of major henry cromwell ( 1658–1711 ) , the grandson of oliver cromwell ; together with several of the couple 's children and grandchildren
