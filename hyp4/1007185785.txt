11 the modern historian frank barlow speculates that theobald may have been a distant relative of his successor as archbishop , thomas becket , as becket 's family came from the same part of normandy the monks of bec unanimously elected him to be their new abbot without first consulting the archbishop of rouen , hugh de boves , who consequently threatened to void the result another problem then arose when hugh demanded a written profession of obedience from theobald , which theobald refused to provide ; no previous abbot had made such a profession theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of peter the venerable , abbot of cluny , allowing theobald to give a verbal profession to hugh theobald travelled to england on business for his abbey at least once during his abbacy , to supervise the monastery 's lands in england , a trip that took place shortly before his selection as the new archbishop of canterbury in 1138 in 1138 king stephen chose theobald to fill the vacant archbishopric of canterbury over stephen 's own brother henry , the bishop of winchester , who had helped stephen gain the throne of england 94–97 the election took place on 24 & nbsp ; december ; stephen was present with the papal legate , alberic of ostia , and a small group of barons and bishops , but henry was absent overseeing the ordination of deacons henry believed that theobald had been elected not only because of stephen 's concerns but also because waleran of meulan , the patronage of bec , was attempting to put his own man in one of the most powerful positions in england 91–92 although theobald was pious and well-educated , he had only become abbot the year before , and his election was probably influenced by the reputation of his monastery , which had already produced two archbishops of canterbury , lanfranc and anselm henry was appointed a papal legate on 1 march 1139 , greenway fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066–1300 : volume 2 : monastic cathedrals ( northern and southern provinces ) : winchester : bishops which meant that henry could now call church councils in england and had power equal to or exceeding that of theobald 72 according to most historians , theobald took little part in the controversy that followed the council , which eventually ended with roger 's death in 1139 and nigel and alexander 's restoration to favour 441–442 recently however , that view has been challenged by two historians who argue that theobald took a more active role in the council they base their view on a vita , or life of the 12th-century mystic christina of markyate , which narrates the events and gives a more central role to theobald , instead of henry of blois , in challenging stephen 's arrest of the three bishops theobald 's actions in the next few years are intertwined with the history of stephen 's ascension to the throne following king henry i 's death in 1135 the succession was disputed between the king 's nephews—stephen and his elder brother , theobald ii , count of champagne—and henry 's surviving legitimate child matilda , usually known as the empress matilda because of her first marriage to the german emperor , henry v after consulting in person with stephen , he secured permission to accept the current conditions , and then joined henry of blois , who had switched sides , at winchester in april for a synod held to depose stephen and crown matilda as queen henry of blois , having switched sides again , then held another legatine council in westminster , which reaffirmed stephen as king 101–103 although theobald spoke out against the manner of election , he took little active part in the subsequent electoral disputes , which resulted eventually in the deposition of fitzherbert and his replacement at york by henry murdac celestine ii was elected on 26 & nbsp ; september 1143 , but he was an opponent of stephen , and thus was not favourably inclined towards stephen 's brother henry either 19–22 before his death , celestine forbade theobald '' to allow any change to be made in the position of the english crown , since the transfer of it had been justly denounced , and the matter was still under dispute '' 62 this became the papal policy , and was a significant change from the recognition of stephen as king by pope innocent ii soon after stephen 's coronation in 1135 62 it essentially forbade theobald from crowning any successor to stephen , especially while stephen was still alive theobald was the only bishop present at the ceremony whose diocese was not in france theobald was back in paris in may 1147 to meet with the new pope , eugene iii ; among the issues probably discussed was theobald 's dispute with bernard of st david 's 99 theobald had a number of reasons for defying the king : chiefly his obedience to the pope 's order commanding his attendance , but also to keep the papacy from favouring the newly elected archbishop of york , henry murdac , in the disputes between york and canterbury the only english bishop specifically named was henry of blois , but the others who did not attend were presumably also suspended although not named theobald appears to have reinstated most of the bishops quickly , as foliot wrote later in 1148 that only the bishops of winchester , durham , worcester , bath and exeter were still suspended gervase also lists hilary of chichester as one of those forgiven by theobald on that date , but as hilary attended the council it is likely that this is an error 26–27 the king was angry with theobald for attending the council , even though the archbishop intervened with eugene , who was displeased with the king for forbidding the bishops ' attendance theobald was also present when henry of anjou met with stephen 's second son william , probably after eustace 's death , to settle william 's lands and status after henry succeeded stephen 100–102 later it was mainly theobald and henry of blois who negotiated the treaty ending the civil war , as neither stephen nor henry of anjou was interested in a compromise theobald was present at stephen 's deathbed in october 1154 , and stephen named him as regent until henry could take up the crown for most of the remainder of theobald 's life he was occupied with ecclesiastical affairs in his diocese , as well as attending the royal court when henry was in england king henry , following the custom of his grandfather henry i , forbade the bishops from recognising either claimant 41–45 eventually , after henry weighed the political factors , he recognised pope alexander iii , and it was only then that theobald also recognised alexander as pope the lack of services would have deprived the monks of income , and theobald 's threat had the desired effect , as jeremiah resigned his office and left christ church for st augustine 's abbey , canterbury 56–59 at easter , 1151 , theobald took over the management of the chapter 's estates , as the new prior , walter parvus , was not up to the task 66–69 another dispute with st augustine 's concerned the right of the archbishops to have a say in the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops 73–75 the conflict re-surfaced in 1149 , when some of the monks of st augustine 's , led by their prior and sacrist , refused to obey the interdict placed on england by theobald and pope eugene iii when the previous abbot of st augustine 's died in 1151 , the prior , silvester , paid the king for the right to administer the abbey and to hold a free election for a new abbot eventually , however , pope eugene iii ordered theobald to allow silvester to take up the office , which theobald did in august 1152 theobald and st augustine 's also came into conflict over the abbey 's claims of exemption from the archbishops ' oversight , because it owed obedience directly to the pope the documents at rome clearly favoured the abbey , but at a royal council held at northampton in 1157 , henry ii ruled in favour of theobald the abbey had never received a papal exemption , but relied instead on its royal foundation by king william i of england and its status as an eigenkirche , or proprietary church of the king 429–432 under king stephen , the abbey 's claims prevailed , but after stephen 's death hilary excommunicated the abbot , who appealed to the papacy theobald supported the bishop , who eventually secured a trial before king henry ii his first act in this area was the consecration of meurig as bishop of bangor in 1140 , during which meurig made a profession of obedience like those made by other bishops subject to canterbury this went against the last half-century of precedent that canterbury had jurisdiction over the four welsh sees , a precedent that dated back to anselm 's days when anselm had consecrated urban as bishop of llandaff in 1107 92–94 along with these consecrations , theobald 's legal efforts enabled him to withstand the attempts of bernard to turn st david 's into an archbishopric , and when bernard was succeeded by david fitzgerald in 1148 , theobald secured the new bishop 's profession of obedience to canterbury , thus ending the efforts to remove wales from canterbury 's jurisdiction also in 1148 , pope eugene decided in favour of canterbury and against the claims of st david 's , securing canterbury 's jurisdiction over wales 101–102 theobald even maintained the theoretical claim of canterbury to jurisdiction over irish sees by consecrating patrick as bishop of limerick in 1140 6 theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of canon law in england ; the conflict that later arose between henry ii and thomas becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during theobald 's time in office 85–88 while still in normandy , theobald had made an intense study of ecclesiastical or canon law , which he continued after being elected archbishop 38 john of salisbury was secretary to theobald for many years , and after theobald 's death became bishop of chartres 595 although theobald was troubled by the opposition of his suffragan henry of blois , he regained control of the english church , secured the rights of his see , and helped maintain the unity of the realm
