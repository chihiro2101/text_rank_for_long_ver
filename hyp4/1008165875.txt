in the hebrew bible , the term is used thrice in leviticus 16 , where two male goats were to be sacrificed to yahweh and one of the two was cleromancy , for yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots in older english versions , such as the king james version , the phrase la-azazel is translated as '' as a scapegoat '' ; however , in most modern english bible translations , it is represented as a name in the text : later rabbis , interpreting azazel as azaz ( rugged ) and el ( of god ) , take it as referring to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down and the king james version also give readings such as young 's literal translation : '' and aaron hath given lots over the two goats , one lot for jehovah , and one lot for a goat of departure ' '' the high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said , '' a sin-offering to yahweh '' ( thus speaking the tetragrammaton ) ; and the two men accompanying him replied , '' blessed be the name of his glorious kingdom for ever and ever the very fact that the two goats were presented before god , before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness , was proof that azazel was not ranked alongside god , but regarded simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous government of god maimonides ( 1134–1204 ) says that as sins can not be taken off one ’ s head and transferred elsewhere , the ritual is symbolic , enabling the penitent to discard his sins : “ these ceremonies are of a symbolic character and serve to impress man with a certain idea and to lead him to repent , as if to say , ‘ we have freed ourselves of our previous deeds , cast them behind our backs and removed them from us as far as possible ’ ” guide to the perplexed 3:46 , featured on the internet sacred text archive the rite , resembling , on one hand , the sending off of the basket with the woman embodying wickedness to the land of shinar in the vision of zechariah , and , on the other , the letting loose of the living bird into the open field in the case of the leper healed from the plague , was , indeed , viewed by the people of jerusalem as a means of ridding themselves of the sins of the year the modern english standard version provides the footnote '' 16:8 the meaning of azazel is uncertain ; possibly the name of a place or a demon , traditionally a scapegoat ; also verses 10 , 26 '' 23–24 ida zatelli ( 1998 ) ida zatelli , '' the origin of the biblical scapegoat ritual : the evidence of two eblaite texts '' , vetus testamentum 48.2 ( april 1998 ) :254–263 ) has suggested that the hebrew ritual parallels pagan practice of sending a scapegoat into the desert on the occasion of a royal wedding found in two ritual texts in archives at ebla ( 24th c this is the only place that the hebrew word is found in the whole hebrew old testament in the dead sea scrolls , the name azazel occurs in the line 6 of 4q203 , the book of giants , which is a part of the enochic literature found at qumran 182 to date no evidence has surfaced of azazel as a demon or god prior to the earliest jewish sources among the dead sea scrolls & nbsp ; 38 here , azazel is one of the leaders of the rebellious watchers in the time preceding the flood ; he taught men the art of warfare , of making swords , knives , shields , and coats of mail , and taught women the art of deception by ornamenting the body , dyeing the hair , and painting the face and the eyebrows , and also revealed to the people the secrets of witchcraft and corrupted their manners , leading them into wickedness and impurity until at last he was , at yahweh 's command , bound hand and foot by the archangel raphael and chained to the rough and jagged rocks of ha dudael ( beth ḥadudo ) , where he is to abide in utter darkness until the great day of judgment , when he will be cast into the fire to be consumed forever & nbsp ; 196–204 according to the book of enoch , azazel ( here spelled ‘ ăzā ’ zyēl ) was one of the chief grigori , a group of fallen angels who married women many believe that this same story ( without any mention of azazel ) is told in the book of genesis 6:2–4 : '' that the sons of god ( בְּנֵ֤י הָֽאֱלֹהִים֙ : benê ’ ʾělō·hîm ) saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose '' some believe , however , that the reference to '' sons of god '' in this passage is referring to men in that god formed man from the ground , and women from men book of genesis 2:7,23 they also claim that hebrews 1:5 '' for unto which of the angels said he at any time , thou art my son , this day have i begotten thee ? '' argues that god never referred to angels as his sons because of these things they see the '' sons of god '' as merely men but the nine passages referred to above are all based on simple english translation comparison and not an actual hebrew textual comparison with genesis 6:1-4 , which contextually places the daughters of men into one group representing humanity ( gen 6:1 '' and it happened that , when humankind began to multiply on the face of the ground , daughters were born to them '' ) , and the '' sons of god '' ( בְּנֵ֤י הָֽאֱלֹהִים֙ : benê ’ ʾělō·hîm ) into a second group none of those nine passages refer to the benê ’ ʾělō·hîm , but only to english translation references to israel , judah , and as god 's children the six old testament passages cited do not support the claim that '' sons of god '' is referring to all humanity , but only that god did refer to israel and judah as his children though the end of luke 3:38 is translated into english as '' son of god '' , it simply says '' of god '' in the greek in 1 john 3 , the author , who refers to his audience as '' my little children '' , does , indeed , proclaim that those who are in christ ( 1 john 1:28 ) are god 's children , but this has nothing to do with the benê ’ ʾělō·hîm of gen 6 because they existed thousands of years before any christians the only other usage of benê ’ ʾělō·hîm in the hebrew bible is found in job 1:6 , and job 2:1 , both of which refer to supernatural beings but the ancient understanding of benê ’ ʾělō·hîm as supernatural beings was so firmly established over the history of israel and judah that in the septuagint , which was completed some time between the 3rd and 1st century b.c , the term '' sons of god '' is replaced with '' angels of god '' in all three of these verses '' god sees the sin brought about by azazel and has raphael “ bind azazel hand and foot and cast him into the darkness : and make an opening in the desert – which is in dudael – and cast him therein ” azazel 's fate is foretold near the end of enoch 2:8 , where god says , “ on the day of apocalypse he shall be cast into the fire
