its primary is an orange-hued giant star with a magnitude of 5.0 , 610 light-years from earth , and its secondary is a blue-white-hued star with a magnitude of 6.6 over 200 variable stars are known in coma berenices , although many are obscure due to its great distance from earth ( 4.7 billion light-years ) , it was not visible to the naked eye and was discovered telescopically in 1975 , the first extra-solar source of extreme ultraviolet , the white dwarf hz 43 , was discovered in coma berenices wasp-56 is a sun-like star of spectral type g6 and apparent magnitude 11.48 with a planet 0.6 the mass of jupiter that has a period of 4.6 days it is a large , diffuse open cluster of about 50 stars ranging between magnitudes five and ten , including several of coma berenices ' stars which are visible to the naked eye it is one of the largest-known clusters , with at least 10,000 galaxies ( mainly elliptical , with a few spiral galaxies ) due to its distance from earth , most of the galaxies are visible only through large telescopes the massive galaxy dragonfly 44 discovered in 2015 was found to consist almost entirely of dark matter ngc 4676 , sometimes called the mice galaxies , is a pair of interacting galaxy 300 million light-years from earth that approach triggered large regions of star formation in both galaxies , with long '' tails '' of dust , stars and gas the two progenitor galaxies are predicted to interact significantly at least one more time before they merge into a larger , probably-elliptical galaxy coma berenices contains the northern portion of the virgo cluster ( also known as the comaâ€“virgo cluster ) , about 60 million light-years away m85 ( ngc 4382 ) , considered elliptical or lenticular , is one of the cluster 's brighter members at magnitude nine m98 ( ngc 4192 ) , a bright , elongated spiral galaxy seen nearly edge-on , appears elliptical because of its unusual angle m100 ( ngc 4321 ) , a magnitude-nine spiral galaxy seen face-on , is one of the cluster 's brightest thumb m64 ( ngc 4826 ) is known as the black eye galaxy because of the prominent dark dust lane in front of the galaxy 's bright nucleus recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy 's outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions , leading astronomers to believe that at least one satellite galaxy collided with it less than a billion years ago it is unique for its region of intense star formation , creating a ring around its nucleus which was discovered by the hubble space telescope it is one of the closest flocculent spiral galaxies ngc 4565 has been nicknamed the needle galaxy because when seen in full , it appears as a narrow streak of light ngc 4651 , about the size of the milky way , has tidal stellar streams gravitationally stripped from a smaller , satellite galaxy
