fundamental research on data and methods for a self-sufficient archaeological approach to information processing produces quantitative methods and computer software specifically geared towards archaeological problem solving and understanding it incorporates a large part of the methods and theories developed in processual archaeology since the 1960s but goes beyond former attempts at quantifying archaeology by exploring ways to represent general archaeological information and problem structures as computer algorithms and data structures it also promotes a formalized understanding of the discipline 's research objects and creates links between archaeology and other quantitative disciplines , both in methods and software technology its agenda can be split up in two major research themes that complement each other : fundamental research ( theoretical ai science ) on the structure , properties and possibilities of archaeological data , inference and knowledge building there is already a large body of literature on the use of quantitative methods and computer-based analysis in archaeology the development of methods and applications is best reflected in the annual publications of the caa conference ( see external links section at bottom ) nevertheless , digital excavation technology , modern heritage management and complex research issues require skilled students and researchers to develop new , efficient and reliable means of processing an ever-growing mass of untackled archaeological data and research problems thus , providing students of archaeology with a solid background in quantitative sciences such as mathematics , statistics and computer sciences seems today more important than ever the most important platform for students and researchers in quantitative archaeology and ai science is the international conference on computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology ( caa ) which has been in existence for more than 30 years now and is held in a different city of europe each year university college london : material culture and data science research group university of york : archaeological information systems research group university of southampton : archaeological computing research group university of birmingham : hp visual and spatial technology centre archaeological computing division foundation for research and technology hellas ( forth ) , center for cultural informatics alexandria archive institute ( aai ) internet and open source for archaeology ( 2004-2013 ) was a portal dedicated to the collection and creation of resources to help archaeologists evaluate open source alternatives to proprietary software '' computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology ( caa '' ) '' international conference on cultural heritage and new technologies '' ( formerly : '' workshop arch√§ologie und computer '' at vienna ) l - p : archaeology archaeovision oxford archaeology digital archaeology data service intrasis gis arctron ( in german ) open context : experimental system for archaeological data-sharing archaeological analytics : digital content for north american material culture
