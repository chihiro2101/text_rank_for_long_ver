he said : '' in this well-known region where the rain occurs in winter and the summers are more or less dry , the dominant vegetation is of a sclerophyllous type and there is little or no natural grassland , though there are many kinds of grass applied by the inhabitants of the cape to any sort of small woodland growth that does not include timber trees '' ; in the current vernacular , this still is the effective sense of the word fynbos – which grows in a 100-to-200-km-wide coastal belt stretching from clanwilliam on the west coast to port elizabeth on the southeast coast – forms part of the cape floral kingdom , where it accounts for half of the surface area and 80 % of the plant species the diversity of fynbos plants is extremely high , with over 9,000 species of plants occurring in the area , around 6,200 of which are endemic , i.e south africa 's western cape has the vast majority of species with one estimate finding 8,550 species in 89,000 & nbsp ; km 2 , which is higher than that estimated for the malayan forests , 7,900 species in 132,000 & nbsp ; km 2 table mountain in cape town supports 2,200 species , more than the entire united kingdom thus , although the fynbos covers only 6 % of the area of southern africa , it has half the species on the subcontinent – and in fact has almost 1 in 5 of all african plant species so far described the flora of the lowlands contains a high number of endemic species , and tends to favour larger plants than those growing on the hillier areas the area is also home to a large number of endemic creatures that have adapted to life in this area , such as the monkey beetles which pollinate ixia viridiflora endemic species of fish in the five river systems occur in the area , too because the higher and wetter areas are more protected and contain important water sources , the original flora is more intact than in the lowlands ; but agriculture and global warming are still threats many different microclimates occur , so the flora changes from west to east , and also varies with altitude up the hillsides away from the coast and according to compass direction in many areas with mediterranean climates , fynbos species have become popular garden plants , in particular aloes and geraniums , and in cooler regions are used as window plants the fynbos is the region of south africa most affected by invasive species which collectively cover around 10 % of the entire country
