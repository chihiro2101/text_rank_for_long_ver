the tumours appear to be benign and can be present for many years , but if large , can mechanically hamper sight , swallowing , and swimming , which may ultimately be fatal as the tumours progress , individuals with large numbers of tumours may become anaemic , have a lack of proteins and iron , and in more advanced stages even suffer from acidosis caused by imbalanced calcium/phosphorus ratios and severe emaciation fibropapillomas are present in other animal groups , but are caused by different viruses , for example the bovine papillomavirus recent research has found that fp is caused by stress and tumours have been observed in turtles that are part of turtle tourism tours the reason for this belief is because nearly all tissue samples tested from turtles with lesions carry genetic material of this herpesvirus , varying between 95 and 100 % depending on different studies and locations the global prevalence of the disease also suggests a multifactorial cause , rather than single factors or agents again , causality has not been concluded , but an association seems to exist between the distribution of especially the dinoflagellates and the occurrence of fp , and as they are found on weeds , they can be ingested by foraging green sea turtles the strongest association with fp is with habitat type , especially increased anthropogenic activity causing high-nitrogen footprints in a surrounding environment where green sea turtles are found even so , observations support the hypothesis that near-shore habitats have a strong correlation with the disease , as newly recruited individuals from the pelagic life phase have never been found with tumours , and when migrating to more shallow ocean zones , such as the neritic zone , individuals still remain free from fp , but when entering lagoon systems , turtles may become infected
