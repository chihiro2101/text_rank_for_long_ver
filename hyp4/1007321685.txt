working in this direction , following the victorious russo-turkish war ( 1877–1878 ) , russia managed to establish an autonomous bulgarian state similarly , after saving serbia from annihilation at the turks ' hands in 1876 , russia forced the ottomans to accept a full independent and expanded serbia two years later apart from the russian pressure upon bulgaria and serbia , another issue that triggered the formation of the league was the battle of deçiq of 1911 in essence , serbia was forced to exchange macedonia for albania , an issue that would play a key role in the eventual dissolution of the league in the spring of 1913 , when the great powers insisted upon the creation of the albanian state and denied serbia its territorial gains in that direction left bulgaria , on its part , had held a long-term policy regarding the ottomans since resgaining independence during the russo-turkish war bulgaria then turned to the more direct method of expansion through winning a war , building a large army for that purpose and started to see itself as the '' prussia of the balkans '' the entry of greece in the league however was essential for the allies , since greece , alone among the balkan states in possessing a major fleet , could preclude the mass transfer of ottoman reinforcements from asia directly into europe by sea these developments did not go unnoticed by the great powers , but although there was an official consensus between the european powers over the eastern question of the ottoman empire , which led to a stern warning to the balkan states , unofficially each of them took a different diplomatic approach due to their conflicting interests in the area but it was unaware of the bulgarian plans over thrace and constantinople , territories on which russia had long-held ambitions , and on which it had just secured a secret agreement of expansion from its allies france and britain , as a reward in participating in the upcoming world war i against the central powers france , not feeling ready for a war against germany in 1912 , took a totally negative position against the league , firmly informing its ally russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between russia and austro-hungary if it resulted from the actions of the balkan league germany , already heavily involved in the internal ottoman politics , officially opposed a war against the empire , but in its effort to win bulgaria for the central powers , and seeing the inevitability of ottoman disintegration , was playing with the idea to replace the balkan positions of the ottomans with a friendly greater bulgaria in its san stefano borders , an idea that was based on the german origin of the bulgarian king and his anti-russian sentiments defeat turned bulgaria into its participation in the first world war on the side of the central powers , since its balkan enemies ( serbia , greece and romania ) were involved in the war on the side of the entente with the outbreak of world war i and the entente 's intervention in macedonia , the conflict between king and first minister steadily deteriorated , leading eventually to the national schism , that greatly contributed to the loss of the next war against kemalist turkey in asia minor , and dominated greek politics for over a half of a century
