in the work which he entitled memoirs of my own times guizot omitted all personal details of his early life this connection introduced him to the literary society of paris in october 1809 , aged twenty-two , he wrote a review of françois-rené de chateaubriand 's martyrs , which won chateaubriand 's approbation and thanks , and he continued to contribute largely to the periodical press after twenty years as russian ambassadress to london , she had separated from her husband and sought refuge in paris , where from 1835 she had held an increasingly influential salon occasionally attended by guizot he was present at her death in paris in 1856 madeleine bingham , princess lieven – russian intriguer , hamish hamilton 1982 , p.209 et seq , pen portrait p.211 during the first french empire , guizot , entirely devoted to literary pursuits , published a collection of french synonyms ( 1809 ) , an essay on the fine arts ( 1811 ) , and a translation of edward gibbon 's the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire , with additional notes , in 1812 these works recommended him to the notice of louis-marcelin de fontanes , grand-master of the university of france , who selected guizot for the chair of modern history at the sorbonne in 1812 he omitted the customary compliment to the all-powerful emperor , in spite of the hints given him by his patron , but the course which followed marks the beginning of the great revival of historical research in france in the 19th century he had now acquired a considerable position in paris society , and the friendship of royer-collard and leading members of the liberal party , including the young duc de broglie absent from paris at the moment of the fall of napoleon in 1814 , he was at once selected , on the recommendation of royer-collard , to serve the government of king louis xviii , in the capacity of secretary-general of the ministry of the interior , under the abbé de montesquiou after the hundred days , he returned to ghent , where he saw louis xviii , and in the name of the liberal party pointed out that a frank adoption of a liberal policy could alone secure the duration of the restored monarchy & nbsp ; – advice which was ill-received by the king 's confidential advisers this visit to ghent was brought up by political opponents in later years as unpatriotic during these years guizot was one of the leaders of the doctrinaires , a small party strongly attached to the charter and the crown , and advocating a policy which has become associated ( especially by émile faguet ) with the name of guizot , that of the juste milieu , a middle path between absolutism and popular government in 1820 , when the reaction was at its height after the murder of the duc de berry , and the fall of the ministry of the duc decazes , guizot was deprived of his offices , and in 1822 even his course of lectures were interdicted during the succeeding years he played an important part among the leaders of the liberal opposition to the government of charles x , although he had not yet entered parliament , and this was also the time of his greatest literary activity written from his own pen during this period was the first part of his histoire de la révolution d'angleterre depuis charles i à charles ii ( 2 vols these lectures formed the basis of his general histoire de la civilisation en europe ( 1828 ; eng guizot was called upon by his friends casimir perier , jacques laffitte , villemain and dupin to draw up the protest of the liberal deputies against the royal ordinances of july , while he applied himself with them to control the revolutionary character of the late contest personally , guizot was always of opinion that it was a great misfortune for the cause of parliamentary government in france that the infatuation and ineptitude of charles x and prince polignac rendered a change in the hereditary line of succession inevitable in 1831 casimir périer formed a more vigorous and compact administration , terminated in may 1832 by his death ; the summer of that year was marked by a formidable republican rising in paris , and it was not until 11 october 1832 that a stable government was formed , in which marshal soult was first minister , victor , 3rd duc de broglie took the foreign office , adolphe thiers the home department , and guizot the department of public instruction he applied himself in the first instance to carry the law of 28 june 1833 , which established and organized primary education in france some of the old members of this learned body & nbsp ; – talleyrand , sieyès , roederer and lakanal & nbsp ; – again took their seats there , and a host of more recent celebrities were added by election for the free discussion of the great problems of political and social science the société de l'histoire de france was founded for the publication of historical works , and a vast publication of medieval chronicles and diplomatic papers was undertaken at the expense of the state for some weeks europe seemed to be on the brink of war , until the king ended the crisis by refusing his assent to the military preparations of thiers , and by summoning guizot from london to form a ministry and to aid his majesty in what he termed '' ma lutte tenace contre l'anarchie thus began , under dark and adverse circumstances , on 29 october 1840 , the important administration in which guizot remained the master-spirit for nearly eight years “ the july monarchy and the napoleonic myth ” the opposition in france denounced guizot 's foreign policy as basely subservient to england he replied in terms of unmeasured contempt : '' you may raise the pile of calumny as high as you will ; vous n'arriverez jamais a la hauteur de mon dédain ! '' in 1845 british and french troops fought side by side for the first time in the anglo-french blockade of the río de la plata the fall of peel 's government in 1846 changed these intimate relations ; and the return of palmerston to the foreign office led guizot to believe that he was again exposed to the passionate rivalry of the british cabinet a friendly understanding had been established between the two courts with reference to the future marriage of the young queen of spain the language of lord palmerston and the conduct of sir henry bulwer ( afterwards lord dalling ) at madrid led guizot to believe that this understanding was broken , provoking the affair of the spanish marriages after guizot came to believe that britain intended to place a coburg on the throne of spain by their influence she was urged into a marriage with a despicable offset of the house of bourbon , and her sister was at the same time married to the youngest son of the french king , in direct violation of louis philippe 's promises this transaction , although it was hailed at the time as a triumph of the policy of france , was in truth as fatal to the monarch as it was discreditable to the minister in this he entirely succeeded by his courage and eloquence as a parliamentary leader , and by the use of all those means of influence which france supplied to a dominant minister '' class , corruption , and politics in the french chamber of deputies , 1846–1848 '' the strength of guizot 's oration was his straightforward style of speaking his confidence in himself , and in the majority of the chamber which he had moulded to his will , was unbounded ; and long success and the habit of authority led him to forget that in a country like france there was a people outside the chamber elected by a small constituency , to which the minister and the king himself were held responsible of finance he knew nothing ; trade and commerce were strange to him ; military and naval affairs were unfamiliar to him ; all these subjects he dealt with by second hand through his friends , pierre sylvain dumon ( 1797–1870 ) , tanneguy duchâtel ( 1803–1867 ) , or marshal bugeaud strange to say , guizot never acknowledged either at the time or to his dying day the nature of this error , and he speaks of himself in his memoirs as the much-enduring champion of liberal government and constitutional law in the afternoon of 23 february 1848 the king summoned his minister from the chamber , which was then sitting , and informed him that considering the situation in paris and elsewhere in the country during the banquet agitation for electoral reform , and the alarm and division of opinion in the royal family , led him to doubt whether he could retain guizot as his prime minister molé failed in the attempt to form a government , and between midnight and one in the morning guizot , who had according to his custom retired early to rest , was again sent for to the tuileries the society of england , though many persons disapproved of much of his recent policy , received the fallen statesman with as much distinction and respect as they had shown eight years before to the king 's ambassador he also published an essay on peel , and amid many essays on religion , during the ten years 1858–1868 , appeared the extensive mémoires pour servir à l'histoire de mon temps , in nine volumes his two daughters , who married two descendants of the illustrious dutch family of de witt , so congenial in faith and manners to the huguenots of france , kept his house two institutions may be said even under the second empire to have retained their freedom : the institute of france and the protestant consistory in both of these guizot continued to the last to take an active part the academy of moral and political science owed its restoration to him , and he became in 1832 one of its first associates the history came down to 1789 , and was continued to 1870 by his daughter madame guizot de witt from her father 's notes his historical works such as histoire générale de la civilisation en europe ( 1828 ) and histoire de la civilisation en france ( 1830 ) were widely admired by such luminaries as john stuart mill ( '' i have dinned into people 's ears that guizot is a great thinker and writer '' ) , johann wolfgang von goethe ( '' guizot is a man after my own heart.he possesses deep knowledge , combined with an enlightened liberality '' ) , charles sainte-beuve ( '' this astonishing man about whom one could say so many things '' ) , and alexis de tocqueville in recent years , the scholarship of pierre rosanvallon , larry siedentop , ivo mosley and aurelian crăiuțu has renewed interest in guizot 's political thought and the doctrinaires more generally guizot ( 1901 ) for a long list of books and articles on guizot in periodicals see hp thième , guide bibliographique de la littérature française de 1800–1906 ( s.c for a notice of his first wife see charles augustin sainte-beuve , portraits de femmes ( 1884 ) , and ch liberalism under siege : the political thought of the french doctrinaires ( 2003 ) guizot : aspects of french history , 1787–1874 ( 1963 ) '' history of european ideas 30.1 ( 2004 ) : 61–82 '' the history of the origins of representative government in europe '' condition of the july monarchy , 1830–1848 at the modern history sourcebook .
