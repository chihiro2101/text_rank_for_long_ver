walter was one of six brothers 5 walter first appears in glanvill 's household in a charter that has been dated to 1178 , although as it is undated it may have been written as late as 1180 he was appointed dean of york by order of king henry ii about july 1186 19 walter was also an unsuccessful candidate to become archbishop of york in september 1186 15 documents also show that walter was active in the administration of the diocese of york after the death of king henry in 1189 , the new king richard i appointed walter bishop of salisbury ; the election took place on 15 september 1189 at pipewell , with the consecration on 22 october 1189 at westminster 270 greenway fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066–1300 : volume 4 : salisbury : bishops also elected to bishoprics at this council were godfrey de lucy to the see of winchester , richard fitzneal to the see of london , and william longchamp to the see of ely 23 walter was probably elevated to a bishopric even though his uncle had lost some of his power because of political manoeuvring over the elevation of king richard 's illegitimate half-brother geoffrey to the see of york , which walter had at first opposed 25–26 soon after his appointment , walter accompanied the king on the third crusade , bartlett england under the norman and angevin kings p 471 walter subsequently led the english army back to england after richard 's departure from palestine , but in sicily he heard of the king 's capture , and diverted to germany he , along with william of sainte-mère-eglise , was among the first of richard 's subjects to find the king at ochsenfurt where he was being held richard wrote to his mother , queen eleanor of aquitaine , that walter should be chosen for the see of canterbury , as well as to the monks of the cathedral chapter , turner '' richard lionheart and english episcopal elections '' albion p 8 and soon after walter 's return to england , he was duly elected archbishop of canterbury , having been transferred to the see on 29 may 1193 after richard was freed , he spent little time in england , instead concentrating on the war with king philip ii of france , which began with philip 's attempts to acquire richard 's possessions on the continent 49 walter was also responsible for choosing royal justices , and many of his choices were connected with , or had previously worked with , the archbishop in the royal administration 79–80 one of walter 's first acts as justiciar was in february 1194 , when he presided over a feudal judgement of john , richard 's younger brother 101–102 when john showed no signs of submitting , walter called an ecclesiastical council at westminster for the purposes of excommunication john unless he submitted 66 eventually in may 1194 , john made peace with richard , and was restored to favour , although the restoration of his lands did not occur until late in 1195 4 although he probably did not take part in the decision to set up a special exchequer for the collection of richard 's ransom , walter did appoint the two escheators , or guardians of the amounts due , cosman medieval wordbook p 105 the first recorded '' foot of the fine '' is endorsed with the statement '' this is the first chirograph that was made in the king 's court in the form of three chirographs , according to the command of his lordship of canterbury and other barons of the king , to the end that by this form a record can be made to be passed on to the treasurer to put in the treasury 68–73 walter also helped with the creation of a more professional group of royal justices although the group , which included simon of pattishall , ralph foliot , richard barre , william de warenne , richard herriard , and walter 's brother osbert fitzhervey , had mostly already served as justices prior to walter 's term of office , it was walter who used them extensively 226–227 in 1195 walter issued an ordinance by which four knights were appointed in every hundred to act as guardians of the peace , a precursor to the office of justice of the peace his use of the knights , who appear for the first time in political life , is the first sign of the rise of this class who , either as member of parliament or justices of the peace , later became the mainstay of english government 279 talks with the welsh began after the english lords roger mortimer and william de briouze expanded into welsh territory in 1195 , causing a concern that the welsh lord rhys ap gruffydd would strike back across the border 73 walter revived the scheme of his predecessor , baldwin of forde , to found a church in canterbury that would be secular and not monk he promised that the new foundation 's canons would not be allowed to vote in archiepiscopal elections nor would the body of saint thomas becket ever be moved to the new church , but the monks of his cathedral chapter were suspicious and appealed to the papacy 141–142 walter refused to acquiesce in the election of gerald of wales to the see of st david 's in wales and opposed the efforts of gerald and others to elevate st david 's to an archbishopric 208 in the later part of richard 's reign , the pressures mounted on walter 280–281 some medieval sources , however , stated that he was forced out of office by the king thumb according to the life of william marshal , which dates to soon after 1219 , when word reached william marshal , one of the richest and most influential barons , that richard was dead , he consulted with walter and discussed whom to support as the next king once john knew he had the support of walter and william marshal , he sent walter ahead to england to request all free men to pledge fealty to the new king 124 on 27 may 1199 walter crowned john , supposedly making a speech that promulgated , for the last time , the theory of a king 's election by the people & nbsp ; 117–118 on his coronation day , john appointed walter lord chancellor in his relations with other officers , walter worked closely with the justiciar geoffrey fitz peter , on the collection of taxation , and both men went to wales in 1203 on a diplomatic mission the medieval chronicler roger of wendover said that the king '' had archbishop hubert of canterbury to act for him in the matter of the church property , geoffrey fitz-peter in the matter of lay property ; and these two spared no one in carrying out their orders saul '' government '' companion to medieval england p in 1201 walter went on a diplomatic mission to philip ii of france , which was unsuccessful , and in 1202 he returned to england as regent while john was abroad philip insisted that john hand over arthur of brittany , arthur 's sister eleanor , and renounce all of his continental possessions before the french king would make peace 96–97 besides sending walter on diplomatic missions , king john gave walter custody of rochester castle on 20 july 1202 , but as walter was already accounting for the taxes and fees of the city of rochester to the exchequer in 1200 , it is possible that he held the castle before 1202 74–75 john also upheld the right of the archbishop to mint coins , which walter held until his death in 1205 76 under john , walter continued to be active in ecclesiastical affairs , and in september 1200 held a provincial church council at london harper-bill '' john and the church '' king john p 303 it was in 1200 that the church court records of the archdiocese of canterbury began to be recorded and kept , although after walter 's death in 1205 the records become sparse until the 14th century 47 the medieval chronicler matthew paris retold the story that when king john heard of walter 's death , the king exclaimed '' now for the first time i am king of england '' 295 walter was not a holy man , although he was , as john gillingham , a historian and biographer of richard i , says , '' one of the most outstanding government ministers in english history '' 274 hugh of lincoln , a contemporary and later canonised , is said to have asked forgiveness of god for not having rebuked walter as often as he probably should have modern historians tend not to share the older view that walter was the driving force behind the administrative changes during richard 's reign , that richard was uninterested in government , and that he left all decisions in the hands of his ministers , especially longchamp and walter 42–43 the studies of james holt and others have shown that richard was highly involved in government decisions , and that it was more a partnership between the king and his ministers 70 walter continued to enjoy the support of richard 's brother john , and it was during john 's reign that a number of walter 's administrative reforms took place , although how much royal initiative was behind the innovations is unknown , given john 's interest in government and administration 485 walter employed several canon lawyers who had been educated at bologna turner '' roman law '' journal of british studies p 61–62 another scholar employed by walter was peter of blois , who served both walter and his predecessor as a latin secretary 40 if he was the author , he composed what chrimes called a '' great literary memorial of henry ii 's government '' 113–114 the historian michael clanchy says of walter '' the proliferation of documents was a european and a continuing phenomenon , yet if it were to be associated in england with one man , he would be hubert walter online reprint of the pipe roll society publication of the feet of fines for henry ii and first seven
