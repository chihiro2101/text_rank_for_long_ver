the act of copying/transferring text from one part of a computer-based document ( '' buffer '' ) to a different location within the same or different computer-based document was a part of the earliest on-line computer editors since moving a region of text requires first removing it from its initial location and then inserting it into its new location , various schemes had to be invented to allow for this multi-step process to be specified by the user the keys involved all cluster together at the left end of the bottom row of the standard qwerty keyboard , and each key is combined with a special modifier key to perform the desired operation : z to undo x to cut c to copy v to paste the ibm common user access ( cua ) standard also uses combinations of the insert , del , shift and control keys similar patterns of key combinations , later borrowed by others , remain widely available in most gui text editors , word processors , and file system browsers the original copy/cut/paste workflow , as implemented at parc , utilized a unique workflow : with two windows on the same screen , the user could use the mouse to pick a point at which to make an insertion in one window ( or a segment of text to replace ) the user selects or '' highlights '' the text or file for moving by some method , typically by dragging over the text or file name with the pointing-device or holding down the shift key while using the arrow keys to move the text cursor on most systems only one clipboard location exists , hence another cut or copy operation overwrites the previously stored information cutting and pasting without a mouse can involve a selection ( for which is pressed in most graphical systems ) or the entire current line , but it may also involve text after the cursor until the end of the line and other more sophisticated operations when a software environment provides cut and paste functionality , a nondestructive operation called copy usually accompanies them ; copy places a copy of the selected text in the clipboard without removing it from its original location some application programs provide a means of viewing , or sometimes even editing , the data on the clipboard the popularity of this method stems from its simplicity and the ease with which users can move data between various applications visually â€“ without resorting to disk storage the x window system maintains an additional clipboard containing the most recently selected text ; middle-clicking pastes the content of this '' selection '' clipboard into whatever the pointer is on at that time text can be placed in the find buffer by either using the find panel or by selecting text and hitting by double clicking ) put the text in the find buffer with overwrite the selected text with your replacement text select the replacement text ( try to avoid lifting your hands from the keyboard ) copy the replacement text find the next or previous occurrence / paste the replacement text repeat the last two steps as often as needed or in short : select , replstr , , , , , , copying data one by one from one application to another , such as from excel to a web form , might involve a lot of manual work copy and paste can be automated with the help of a program that would iterate through the values list and paste them to the active window ( computing ) alternatively , applications supporting simultaneous editing may be used to copy or move collections of items each time a user performs a cut or copy operation , the system adds the affected text to the ring web users copy on website different things for different reasons , including words and phrases to look up elsewhere , key sentences for use in citations and text summaries , and programming code fragments for use in software development
