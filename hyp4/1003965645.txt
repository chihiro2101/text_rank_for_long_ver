according to the recent genetic studies , the ryukyuan people share more alleles with the jōmon period ( 16,000–3,000 years ago ) hunter-gatherers and ainu people than the yamato people , have smaller genetic contributions from asian continental populations , which supports the dual-structure model of k hanihara ( 1991 ) , a widely accepted theory which suggests that the yamato japanese are more admixed with asian agricultural continental people ( from the korean peninsula ) than the ainu and the ryukyuans , with major admixture occurring in and after the yayoi period ( 3,000-1,700 years ago ) within the japanese population the ryukyu make a separate and one of the two genome-wide clusters along the main-island honshu the admixture event which formed the admixed ryukyuans was estimated at least 1100–1075 years ago , which corresponds to the gusuku period , and is considered to be related to the arrival of migrants from japan it is assumed that m7a represents '' jomon genotype '' introduced by a paleolithic ancestor from southeast asia or the south asia , around the last glacial maximum with the ryukyu islands as one of the probable origin spots , in contrast , the frequency of the d4 haplogroup is relatively high in east asian populations , including in japan , indicating immigrant yayoi people , probably by the end of the late kaizuka period , while haplogroup b4 presumably ancient aboriginal taiwanese ancestry a recent craniometric study shows that the ryukyuan people are closely related to the yamato people and their common main ancestors , the yayoi people the ryukyu islands were inhabited from at least 32,000-18,000 years ago , but their fate and relation with contemporary ryukyuan people is uncertain in the latter part of jōmon period , archaeological sites moved near the seashore , suggesting the engagement of people in fishery it is considered that from the latter half of jōmon period , the ryukyu islands developed their own culture the finding of ancient chinese knife money near naha in okinawa indicate a probable contact with the ancient chinese state yan as early as the 3rd century bce according to the shan hai jing , the yan had relations with the wa ( dwarf , short ) people living southeast of korea , who could be related to both the mainland japanese or ryukyuan people there 's lack of evidence that the missions by han dynasty ( 206 bc – 220 ad ) reached the islands , however as the japanese did reach han 's luoyang , notes from 57 ce do mention a general practice of tattooing among the people of '' hundred kingdoms '' in the eastern islands , a practice which was widespread and survived only among the okinawan 's women , ainu in hokkaido , and atayal people in taiwan cao wei ( 220–265 ) and han dynasty record show that the inhabitants of western and southern japan and okinawa had a lot in common regarding political-social institutions until the 2nd century ce - they were of small stature , bred oxen and swine , as well were ruled by women , with special influence of women sorceresses , which is related to the ryukyuan noro priestesses which were closely associated with local political power until the 20th century , as well the ryukyuan swine economy culture until world war ii the first certain mention of the islands and its people by the chinese and japanese is dated in the 7th century in 616 the japanese annals for the first time mention the '' southern islands people '' , and for the half-century were noted some intruders from yaku and tanu nevertheless the mention or authority , over the centuries the japanese influence spread slowly among the communities the lack of written record resulted with later , 17th century royal tales both under chinese and japanese influence , which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the '' divine right '' of their royal authority , as well the then-political interests of tokugawa shōguns from minamoto clan who wanted to legitimize japanese domination over okinawa this period is also notable , compared to mainland japan , for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice , wheat , millet and the overseas trading of these goods , as well during shubanjunki 's rule the introduction of japanese kana writing system in its older and simple phonetic form in this period another rapid economical , social and cultural development of ryukyu began as the polities had developed formal trade relations with japan , korea and china in the next two decades chūzan made nine official missions to the chinese capital , and the formal relations between them endured until 1872 ( see imperial chinese missions to ryukyu kingdom ) the tributary relationship with china later became a basis of the 19th century sino-japanese disputes about the claims of okinawa a paper fan found during the japanese invasions of korea ( 1592–98 ) mentioning a title '' kamei , lord of ryukyu '' , reveals that hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post although he had no legitimate claim upon the islands as the ming 's influence weakened due to disorder in china , japanese established posts in southeast asia , and the europeans ( spanish and portuguese ) arrived , the kingdom 's overseas trade began to decline they nominally let a certain level of autonomy and independence to the kingdom due to ming 's prohibition of trade with the shogunate , but forbade them trade with other countries except china the relations with qing dynasty improved after their second mission when the first ryukyuan official students were sent to china in 1688 this method of gradual integration was designed to avoid both ryukyuan and chinese protests , with the ruling shuri castle unaware of the significance of these developments , including japan 's decision to grant political representation to the ryukyuan islanders involved in the japanese invasion of taiwan ( 1874 ) members of the ryukyuan aristocratic classes such as kōchi chōjō and rin seikō continued to resist annexation for almost two decades ; however , following the first sino-japanese war ( 1894-1895 ) , both chinese and ryukyuan interest in sovereignty faded as china renounced its claims to the island many historians criticise meiji-era japan 's characterisation of the process as being considered a relatively simple administrative change , rather than the creation of japan 's first colony and the beginning of its 'inner colonialism ' indoctrination into a militaristic and emperor-centred ideology for children began from the age of beginning elementary school onwards ; the ultimate goal of this education was a total unification of the ryukyuan people into the yamato people , embodying the ideal of ethnic purity , with contemporary literature for the time ignoring japan 's minorities around and especially after the japanese annexation of taiwan in 1895 , japan 's developmental focus shifted away from okinawa , resulting in a period of famine known as ( '' cycad hell '' ) as a result of the ensuing economic crisis , many people were forced to either find work in japan ( often osaka and kobe ) or abroad in taiwan whereas the japanese had enjoyed political freedom and economic prosperity in the post-war years , the facilities , used for the purposes of japanese regional security against the communism threat , had a negative economic impact on the islands , leading to many ryukyuans feeling cheated , some considering the facilities a national disgrace since 1972 there have been extensive plans to bring okinawa 's economy up to the national level , as well continued support for the local culture and a revival of traditional arts started by the uscar ryukyuans tend to see themselves as bound together by their home island and , especially among older ryukyuans , usually consider themselves from okinawa first and japan second furthermore , okinawa has long had the highest life expectancy at older ages , as well has had among the highest prevalence of centenarians among the 47 japanese prefectures , also the world , since records began to be kept by the ministry of health in the early 1960s despite the high birth rate and expanding

1959–2009 ) varied between 300 bce and 700 ce , while novel ( 2009–2011 ) around 2nd century bce to 100 ce , which has a lack of correlation with archeology and new chronology according to which yayoi period started around 950 bce , or the proposed spread of the proto-ryukyuan speakers to the islands in the 10–12th century from kyushu 250–538 ) , while mainland proto-ryukyuan was in contact with early middle japanese until 13th century the northern ryukyuan does not , while southern ryukyuan does show north-to-south expansion and thus exist several scenarios it is generally considered that the likely homeland of japonic and proto-ryukyuan expansion was in kyushu , compared to another hypothesis of expansion from ryukyu to mainland japan as the japanese ( or yamato people ) learned to write and read a thousand years before the ryukyuans and absorbed many chinese language forms , the early literature which records the language of the old japanese imperial court show archaisms which are closer to okinawan dialects within them and on specific islands exist local dialects , of which many vanished during the meiji and post-meiji period the languages were identified as dialects of japanese , and viewed negatively were suppressed by the japanese government which forced assimilation and standard japanese language after ww ii , during the united states occupation the ryukyuan languages and identity were distinctively promoted , also because of ideo-political reasons to separate the ryukyus from japan , however as the resentment against the occupation intensified their rapport and unification with japan , since 1972 followed re-incursion of the standard japanese and further diminution of the ryukyuan languages only older people speak ryukyuan languages , because japanese replaced it as the daily language in nearly every context the status of women in traditional society is higher than in china and japan the introduction of buddhism is ascribed to a 13th century priest from japan ( mostly funeral rites , while the 14th century trade relations resulted with korean buddhism influences ( including some in architecture ) , as well shinto practices from japan the foremost account , which claimed common origin between the japanese and ryukyuan people , was made-up by shō shōken in the 17th century , to end up the pilgrimage of the ryukyu king and chief priestess to the kudaka island additionally , since being under japanese control , shinto and buddhism are also practiced and typically mixed with local beliefs and practices in remote districts
