many of the transition metals in period 4 are very strong , and therefore commonly used in industry , especially iron the period 's s-block metals put their differentiating electron onto 4s having vacancies among nominally lower states & nbsp ; â€“ a phenomenon unseen in lighter elements it is one of the most reactive elements in the periodic table , therefore usually only found in compounds an alkali earth metal , calcium is almost never found in nature due to its high reactivity with water titanium is both one of the least dense metals and one of the strongest and most corrosion-resistant , and as such has many applications , especially in alloys with other elements , such as iron vanadium is never found in pure form in nature , but is commonly found in compounds vanadium is similar to titanium in many ways , such as being very corrosion-resistant , however , unlike titanium , it oxidizes in air even at room temperature manganese is often found in combination with iron manganese is also often used in pigments , again like chromium iron is the most common on earth among elements of the period , and probably the most well-known of them iron-56 has the lowest energy density of any isotope of any element , meaning that it is the most massive element that can be produced in supergiant stars iron also has some applications in the human body ; hemoglobin is partly iron cobalt is also a core component of many magnetic and high-strength alloys the only stable isotope , cobalt-59 , is an important component of vitamin b-12 , while cobalt-60 is a component of nuclear fallout and can be dangerous in large enough quantities due to its radioactivity however , nickel is very abundant in the earth 's core ; along with iron it is one of the two main components copper has been used by humans for thousands of years to provide a reddish tint to many objects , and is even an essential nutrient to humans , although too much is poisonous however , too much zinc can cause copper deficiency zinc is often used in batteries , aptly named carbon-zinc batteries , and is important in many platings , as zinc is very corrosion resistant selenium is quite rare in pure form in nature , mostly being found in minerals such as pyrite , and even then it is quite rare zinc ions are used to stabilize the zinc finger milleu of many dna-binding protein period 4 elements can also be found complexed with organic small molecule to form cofactors
