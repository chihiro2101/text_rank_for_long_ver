all armillaria species have a white spore print and none have a volva ( cup at base ) ( compare amanita ) which can grow side by side with armillaria spp honey fungus spreads from living trees , dead and live roots and stumps by means of reddish-brown to black rhizomorphs ( root-like structures ) at the rate of approximately a year , but infection by root contact is possible rhizomorphs grow close to the soil surface ( in the top and invade new roots , or the root collar ( where the roots meet the stem ) of plants an infected tree will die once the fungus has girdled it , or when significant root damage has occurred initial symptoms of honey fungus infection include dieback or shortage of leaves in spring rhizomorphs ( also called mycelial cords ) appear under the bark and around the tree , and mushrooms grow in clusters from the infected plant in autumn and die back after the first frost new questions remain unanswered regarding the phylogeny of north american armillaria species and their relationships to their european counterparts , particularly within the “ armillaria mellea complex ” intersterile species of armillaria occurring in north america ( north american biological species nabs ) were listed by mallett ( 1992 ) : mallett , k.i armillaria ostoyae is the species most commonly found in all canadian provinces surveyed ( mallett 1990 ) armillaria root rot pathogens of the canadian prairie provinces armillaria root rot occurs in the northwest territories , and was identified on white spruce at pine point on great slave lake prior to nabs findings important forest insects and diseases of mutual concern to canada , the united states , and mexico in alberta , 75 % of trap logs ( mallett and hiratsuka 1985 ) inserted into the soil between planted spruce became infected with the distinctive white mycelium of armillaria within one year impact of armillaria root rot in intensively managed white spruce/asspen stands
