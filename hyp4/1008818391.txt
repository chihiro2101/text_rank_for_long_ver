'happiness ' is the subject of debate on usage and meaning , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy states that '' an important project in the philosophy of happiness is simply getting clear on what various writers are talking about ) international differences in well-being , 2010 , oxford university press , new york , the word is mostly used in relation to two factors : the current experience of the feeling of an emotion ( affect ) such as pleasure or joy , or of a more general sense of 'emotional condition as a whole' dan haybron ( , ; '' i would suggest that when we talk about happiness , we are actually referring , much of the time , to a complex emotional phenomenon '' people don ’ t want to be happy the way i ’ ve defined the term – what i experience here and now in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives for instance ruut veenhoven has defined happiness as '' overall appreciation of one 's life as-a-whole and in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person ’ s life , or of their happy life , even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable “ people don ’ t want to be happy the way i ’ ve defined the term – what i experience here and now in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives 'can happiness be measured ' , action for happiness , includes measures of current experience ( emotions , moods , and feelings ) and of life satisfaction see subjective well-being components of swb for instance sonja lyubomirsky has described happiness as “ the experience of joy , contentment , or positive well-being , combined with a sense that one 's life is good , meaningful , and worthwhile 44 in the global sample ) , at all levels , with life satisfaction—strictly speaking , a “ life evaluation ” measure that asks respondents to rate their lives without saying whether they are satisfied if the results hold up , the upshot appears to be that income is pretty strongly related to life satisfaction , but weakly related to emotional well-being , at least above a certain threshold the implied meaning of the word may vary depending on context , '' how does happiness come into this classification ? for better or worse , it enters in three ways it is sometimes used as a current emotional report – “ how happy are you now ? , ” sometimes as a remembered emotion , as in “ how happy were you yesterday ? , ” and very often as a form of life evaluation , as in “ how happy are you with your life as a whole these days ? ” people answer these three types of happiness question differently , so it is important to keep track of what is being asked the main linguistic argument for using happiness in a broader generic role is that happiness plays two important roles within the science of well-being , appearing once as a prototypical positive emotion and again as part of a cognitive life evaluation question the converse argument made in the world happiness reports is that this double usage helps to justify using happiness in a generic role , as long as the alternative meanings are clearly understood and credibly related evidence from a growing number of large scale surveys shows that the answers to questions asking about the emotion of happiness differ from answers to judgmental questions asking about a person ’ s happiness with life as a whole in exactly the ways that theory would suggest evaluative answers , in response to questions about life as a whole , are supported by positive emotions , as noted above , but also driven much more , than are answers to questions about emotions , by a variety of life circumstances , including income , health and social trust traditional european societies , inherited from the greeks and from christianity , often linked happiness with morality , which was concerned with the performance in a certain kind of role in a certain kind of social life happiness is no longer defined in relation to social life , but in terms of individual psychology happiness , however , remains a difficult term for moral philosophy thus understood , the happy life is the good life , that is , a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way specifically , aristotle argued that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity according to aristotle , the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life aristotle argued a second best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity was the life of moral virtue '' nietzsche meant that making happiness one 's ultimate goal and the aim of one 's existence , in his words '' makes one contemptible '' nietzsche instead yearned for a culture that would set higher , more difficult goals than '' mere happiness nietzsche instead wants us to consider the value of what is difficult , what can only be earned through struggle , difficulty , pain and thus to come to see the affirmative value suffering and unhappiness truly play in creating everything of great worth in life , including all the highest achievements of human culture , not least of all philosophy more mundane forms of happiness , such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships , are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people ( see sukha ) the primary meaning of '' happiness '' in various european languages involves good fortune , chance or happening '' however , where utilitarians focused on reasoning about consequences as the primary tool for reaching happiness , aquinas agreed with aristotle that happiness can not be reached solely through reasoning about consequences of acts , but also requires a pursuit of good causes for acts , such as habits according to virtue '' and , '' the last end can not consist in the active life , which pertains to the practical intellect beyond the routine of needs fulfillment , maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience , known as peak experiences , profound moments of love , understanding , happiness , or rapture , during which a person feels more whole , alive , self-sufficient , and yet a part of the world he finds that the extent to which a society allows free choice has a major impact on happiness when basic needs are satisfied , the degree of happiness depends on economic and cultural factors that enable free choice in how people live their lives since 2000 the field of positive psychology has expanded drastically in terms of scientific publications , and has produced many different views on causes of happiness , and on factors that correlate with happiness if you seek it , you wo n't find it , because seeking is the antithesis of happiness ” eckhart tolle , a new earth : awakening to your life 's purpose '' wealth , like happiness , is never attained when sought after directly the only chance is to treat , not happiness , but some end external to it , as the purpose of life and i still hold to it as the best theory for all those who have but a moderate degree of sensibility and of capacity for enjoyment ; that is , for the great majority of mankind iris mauss has shown that the more people strive for happiness , the more likely they ’ ll set up too high of standards and feel disappointed sigmund freud said that all humans strive after happiness , but that the possibilities of achieving it are restricted because we '' are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from the status quo the scale requires participants to use absolute ratings to characterize themselves as happy or unhappy individuals , as well as it asks to what extent they identify themselves with descriptions of happy and unhappy individuals happiness is evaluated , as in “ how happy are you with your life as a whole ? ” , and in emotional reports , as in “ how happy are you now ? , ” and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts a positive relationship has been suggested between the volume of the brain 's gray matter in the right precuneus area and one 's subjective happiness score '' this seems to suggest a subjective interpretation but one that goes beyond emotions alone work by paul anand and colleagues helps to highlight the fact that there many different contributors to adult wellbeing , that happiness judgement reflect , in part , the presence of salient constraints , and that fairness , autonomy , community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course although these factors play a role in happiness , they do not all need to act in simultaneously to help one achieve an increase in happiness according to the cato institute , people constantly make choices that decrease their happiness , because they have also more important aims
