however , while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor 's degree ( baccalaureus ) , the latter was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the master 's degree ( magister ) and doctorate , both of which now became the accepted teaching qualifications the degrees awarded by european universities – the bachelor 's degree , the licentiate , the master 's degree , and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world stewart notes a difference in the granting authority ( individual professor for the ijzazah and a corporate entity in the case of the university doctorate ) chris park explains that it was not until formal education and degree programs were standardized in the early 19th century that the doctorate of philosophy was reintroduced in germany as a research degree , park , c the traditional term of study before new teachers were admitted to the guild of '' masters of arts '' was seven years , matching the apprenticeship term for other occupations originally the terms '' master '' and '' doctor '' were synonymous , but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the master 's degree the use and meaning of the doctorate has changed over time , and is subject to regional variations after that time the german practice of requiring lecturers to have completed a research doctorate spread universities ' shift to research-oriented education ( based upon the scientific method , inquiry , and observation ) increased the doctorate 's importance today , a research doctorate ( phd ) or its equivalent ( as defined in the us by the nsf ) is generally a prerequisite for an academia career , although many recipients do not work in academia the first professional doctorate to be offered in the united states was the m.d at kings college ( now columbia university ) after the medical school 's founding in 1767 , although this was not a professional doctorate in the modern american sense as it was awarded for further study after the qualifying bachelor of medicine ( m.b the md became the standard first degree in medicine in the us during the 19th century , but as a three-year undergraduate degree ; it did not become established as a graduate degree until 1930 the md , as the standard qualifying degree in medicine , gave that profession the ability ( through the american medical association , established in 1847 for this purpose ) to set and raise standards for entry into professional practice the modern research degree , in the shape of the german-style phd , was first awarded in the us in 1861 , at yale university in the uk , research doctorates initially took the form of higher doctorates in science and letters , first introduced at durham university in 1882 however it took a long time to be accepted , not replacing the bachelor of laws ( llb ) until the 1960s , by which time the llb was generally taken as a graduate degree notably , the curriculum for the jd and llb were identical , with the degree being renamed as a doctorate , and it ( like the md ) was not equivalent to the phd , raising criticism that it was '' not a 'true doctorate when professional doctorates were established in the uk in the late 1980s and early 1990s , they did not follow the us model but were instead set up as research degrees at the same level as phds but with some taught components and a professional focus for the research work the habilitation is still used for academic recruitment purposes in many countries within the eu , and involves either a new long thesis ( a second book ) or a portfolio of research publications the best-known research degree title , in the english-speaking world , is doctor of philosophy ( abbreviated ph.d candidates may also be required to complete graduate-level courses in their field , as well as study research methodology the time required to complete a research doctorate varies from three years , excluding undergraduate study , to six years or more these degrees were awarded by the employees ' former university , usually after years of research in industrial laboratories the only professional doctorate in japan is the juris doctor , known as hōmu hakushi ( 法務博士 ) the justice system reform council ( 2001 ) after successful completion of the first year of university , the student was awarded the propaedeutic diploma ( not a degree ) in physics and mathematics , the student could directly obtain a kandidaats ( candidate ) diploma in two years it used to be attained after completion of the majority of courses of the academic study ( usually after completion of course requirements of the third year in the program ) , after which the student was allowed to begin work on their doctorandus thesis students can only enroll in a doctorate system after completing a research university level master 's degree ; although dispensation can be granted on a case-by-case basis after scrutiny of the individual 's portfolio the most common way to conduct doctoral studies is to work as promovendus/assistant in opleiding ( aio ) /onderzoeker in opleiding ( oio ) ( research assistant with additional courses and supervision ) , perform extensive research and write a dissertation consisting of published articles ( over a period of four or more years , averaging about 5.5 to 6 ) the licentiaat ( licensee ) title was in use for a regular graduate until the bologna reform changed the licentiaat degree to the master 's degree ( the bologna reform abolished the two-year kandidaat degree and introduced a three-year academic bachelor 's degree instead ) ) degree and requires at least ( and typically more than ) three , four or five years of post-graduate research which is finished by defence of dissertation or rarely—thesis additionally , a seeker of the degree has to pass three examinations ( a so-called '' kandidate 's minimum '' ) : in his/her special field , in a foreign language , and in the history and philosophy of science , which originates from the course of communist ideology named similar in soviet times ) the second stage , doktor nauk , '' doctor of sciences '' , requires many years of research experience , and writing of a second dissertation a minimum of 4 years of study is required , divided into 2 stages : a 2-year ( or longer ) period of studies concludes with a public dissertation presented to a panel of 3 professors from 2008 it is possible to substitute the former diploma by a recognized master program in the same royal decree the initial 3-year study period was replaced by a research master 's degree ( one or two years ; professional master 's degrees do not grant direct access to ph.d a doctorate is required in order to teach at the university the doctorate has long existed in the uk as , originally , the second degree in divinity , law , medicine and music but it was not until the late 19th century that the research doctorate , now known as the higher doctorate , was introduced the first higher doctorate was the doctor of science at durham university , introduced in 1882 this was soon followed by other universities , including the university of cambridge establishing its scd in the same year , the university of london transforming its dsc from an advanced study course to a research degree in 1885 , and the university of oxford establishing its doctor of letters ( dlitt ) in 1900 oxford became the first university to institute the new degree , although naming it the dphil the earliest professional doctorates were in the social sciences , including the doctor of business administration ( dba ) , doctor of education ( edd ) and doctor of clinical psychology ( dclinpsy ) today , except for those awarded honoris causa ( honorary degrees ) , all doctorates granted by british universities are research doctorates , in that their main ( and in many cases only ) component is the submission of an extensive and substantial thesis or portfolio of original research , examined by an expert panel appointed by the university uk doctorates are categorised as : ; junior doctorates : subject specialist doctorates – normally phd/dphil ; the most common form of doctorate : integrated subject specialist doctorates – integrated phds including teaching at master 's level : doctorates by publication – phd by published works ; only awarded infrequently : professional and practice-based ( or practitioner ) doctorates – e.g while the master/apprentice model was traditionally used for british phds , since 2003 courses have become more structured , with students taking courses in research skills and receiving training for professional and personal development however , the assessment of the phd remains based on the production of a thesis or equivalent and its defence at a oral exam oral examination , normally held in front of at least two examiners , one internal and one external students who are not considered likely to complete a phd may be offered the opportunity to complete an mphil instead these integrate teaching at master 's level during the first one or two years of the degree , either alongside research or as a preliminary to starting research while passing the taught elements is often required , examination of the final doctorate is still by thesis ( or equivalent ) alone higher doctorates are awarded in recognition of a substantial body of original research undertaken over the course of many years while the habilitation formally determines whether an academic is suitably qualified to be a university professor , the higher doctorate does not qualify the holder for a position but rather recognises their contribution to research higher doctorates were defined by the uk council for graduate education ( ukcge ) in 2013 as : in terms of number of institutions offering the awards , the most common doctorates of this type in ukcge surveys carried out in 2008 and 2013 were the doctor of science ( dsc ) , doctor of letters ( dlitt ) , doctor of law ( lld ) , doctor of music ( dmus ) and doctor of divinity ( dd ) ; in the 2008 survey the doctor of technology ( dtech ) tied with the dd however , some universities differentiate between honorary and substantive doctorates , using the degree of doctor of the university ( d.univ us research doctorates are awarded for successfully completing and defending independent research presented in the form of a dissertation , along with advanced study multiple professional degrees use the term '' doctor '' in their title , such as juris doctor and doctor of medicine , but these degrees do not always contain an independent research component or always require a dissertation and should not be confused with ph.d./d.phil./ed.d./d.ed such professional degrees are referred to as an entry level doctorate program and ph.d doctoral applicants were previously required to have a master 's degree , but many programs accept students immediately following undergraduate studies many programs gauge the potential of a student applying to their program and grant a master 's degree upon completion of the necessary ph.d department of education listed over 20 '' frequently '' awarded research doctorate titles identified by the national science foundation ( nsf ) in a 2008 document as representing degrees equivalent in research content to the ph.d the doctor of music and doctor of industrial technology were removed in 2008 , after the study evaluation identified that these were fully professional , rather than research-based , doctorates some of these degrees are also termed '' first professional degrees , '' since they are the first field-specific master 's or doctoral degrees
