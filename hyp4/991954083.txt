the coil detector was barely sensitive enough , resulting in poor , noisy meg measurements that were difficult to use since current dipoles must have similar orientations to generate magnetic fields that reinforce each other , it is often the layer of pyramidal cells , which are situated perpendicular to the cortical surface , that gives rise to measurable magnetic fields researchers are experimenting with various signal processing methods in the search for methods that detect deep brain ( i.e it is worth noting that action potentials do not usually produce an observable field , mainly because the currents associated with action potentials flow in opposite directions and the magnetic fields cancel out however , action fields have been measured from peripheral nerves since the magnetic signals emitted by the brain are on the order of a few femtoteslas , shielding from external magnetic signals , including the earth 's magnetic field , is necessary the challenge posed by meg is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head problems such as this , where model parameters ( the location of the activity ) have to be estimated from measured data ( the squid signals ) are referred to as inverse problems ( in contrast to forward problems where the model parameters ( e.g possible solutions can be derived using models involving prior knowledge of brain activity under-determined models may be used in cases where many different distributed areas are activated ( '' distributed source solutions '' ) : there are infinitely many possible current distributions explaining the measurement results , but the most likely is selected localization algorithms make use of given source and head models to find a likely location for an underlying focal field generator another common technique is beamforming , wherein a theoretical model of the magnetic field produced by a given current dipole is used as a prior , along with second-order statistics of the data in the form of a covariance matrix , to calculate a linear weighting of the sensor array ( the beamformer ) via the backusâ€“gilbert method if one 's goal is to estimate the current density within the human brain with say a 5mm resolution then it is well established that the vast majority of the information needed to perform a unique inversion must come not from the magnetic field measurement but rather from the constraints applied to the problem the locations of the fiducial points in each data set are then used to define a common coordinate system so that superimposing the functional meg data onto the structural mri data ( '' coregistration '' ) is possible a criticism of the use of this technique in clinical practice is that it produces colored areas with definite boundaries superimposed upon an mri scan : the untrained viewer may not realize that the colors do not represent a physiological certainty , because of the relatively low spatial resolution of meg , but rather a probability cloud derived from statistical processes a widely accepted source-modeling technique for meg involves calculating a set of equivalent current dipoles ( ecds ) , which assumes the underlying neuronal sources to be focal the limitations of dipole models for characterizing neuronal responses are ( 1 ) difficulties in localizing extended sources with ecds , ( 2 ) problems with accurately estimating the total number of dipoles in advance , and ( 3 ) dependency on dipole location , especially depth in the brain as the number of unknown dipole moments is much greater than the number of meg sensors , the inverse solution is highly underdetermined , so additional constraints are needed to reduce ambiguity of the solution however , the resulting distributions may be difficult to interpret , because they only reflect a '' blurred '' ( or even distorted ) image of the true neuronal source distribution the matter is complicated by the fact that spatial resolution depends strongly on several parameters such as brain area , depth , orientation , number of sensors etc meg can resolve events with a precision of 10 milliseconds or faster , while functional mri ( fmri ) , which depends on changes in blood flow , can at best resolve events with a precision of several hundred milliseconds neuronal ( meg ) and hemodynamic ( fmri ) data do not necessarily agree , in spite of the tight relationship between local field potentials ( lfp ) and blood oxygenation level-dependent ( bold ) signals knowing the exact position of essential brain regions ( such as the primary motor cortex and primary sensory cortex , visual cortex , and areas involved in speech production and comprehension ) helps to avoid surgically induced neurological deficits its strengths consist in independence of head geometry compared to eeg ( unless ferromagnetic implants are present ) , non-invasiveness , use of no ionizing radiation , as opposed to pet and high temporal resolution as opposed to fmri magnetic fields are less distorted than electric fields by the skull and scalp , which results in a better spatial resolution of the meg eeg is , therefore , sensitive to activity in more brain areas , but activity that is visible in meg can also be localized with more accuracy finally , meg is reference-free , while scalp eeg relies on a reference that , when active , makes interpretation of the data difficult .
