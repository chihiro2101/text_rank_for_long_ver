history of algebraic number theory the unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century in this book gauss brings together results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as fermat , euler , lagrange and legendre and adds important new results of his own based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields , he proved the dirichlet unit theorem , a fundamental result in algebraic number theory david hilbert unified the field of algebraic number theory with his 1897 treatise zahlbericht ( literally '' report on numbers '' ) he then had little more to publish on the subject ; but the emergence of hilbert modular forms in the dissertation of a student means his name is further attached to a major area the concepts were highly influential , and his own contribution lives on in the names of the hilbert class field and of the hilbert symbol of local class field theory this law is a general theorem in number theory that forms a central part of global class field theory the class number formula relates many important invariants of a number field to a special value of its dedekind zeta function moreover , the study of higher-dimensional schemes over z instead of number rings is referred to as arithmetic geometry
