prior to the introduction of the bulletin board system ( bbs ) , modems typically operated on direct-dial telephone lines that always began and ended with a known modem at each end generally , the user placing the call would switch their modem to '' originate '' and then dial the number by hand when automation was required , it was commonly only needed on the answer side & nbsp ; — for instance , a bank might need to take calls from a number of branch offices for end-of-day processing another solution would have been to use a separate set of '' command pins '' dedicated to sending and receiving commands , another could have used a signal pin indicating that the modem should interpret incoming data as a command in actual use many of the commands automatically switched to the online mode after completion , and it is rare for a user to use the online command explicitly this had a major denial of service security implication in that it would lead to the modem hanging up the connection should the computer ever try to transmit the byte sequence '' +++ath0 '' in data mode the same error would also trigger if , for example , the user of the computer ever tried to send an e-mail containing the aforementioned string it also includes various controls to set up the modem , including a set of register commands which allowed the user to directly set the various memory locations in the original hayes modem the expansion to 1200 and 2400 baud required the addition of a small set of new commands , some of them prefixed with an ampersand ( '' & '' ) to denote those dedicated to new functionality frank durda iv , '' the at command set reference - history '' , 1993 essentially by accident , this allowed users of existing 1200 baud modems to use the new hayes 2400 models without changing their software slowly , a set of commands based heavily on the original hayes extended set using '' & '' commands became popular , and then universal proprietary command set & nbsp ; – usually starting either with a backslash ( “ \ ” ) or with a percent sign ( “ % ” ) ; these commands vary widely among modem manufacturers the line feed character is output after the carriage return character if verbose result codes are used ( v1 option is used ) ; otherwise , if numeric format result codes are used ( v0 option is used ) , it will not appear in the result codes in at commands which do not store the values of any of their subparameters , and so have not a read command , which are called action type commands , the action should be done on the basis of the recommended default setting of the subparameter most modem software supported a user supplied initialization string , which was typically a long concatenated at command which was sent to the modem upon launch terminal-emulator software typically allows the user to send hayes commands directly to the modem , and to see the responses some recent high speed modems provide a virtual ethernet interface instead of using a point-to-point protocol ( ppp ) for the data connection because of performance reasons ( ppp connection is only used between the computer and the modem , not over network ) list of at commands : basic ( hayes ) , extended , proprietary hayes at command reference manual a list of hayes at commands 3gpp.org , 3gpp at command set for user equipment modem initialisation string extended hayes at command parameters for sms ( dead ) determining your class of fax / modem openmoko : at commands cell modem commands itu standard v.250 at commands reference guide from telit ( dead )
