bradley of binghamton , new york received for a process of creating margarine that combined vegetable oils ( primarily cottonseed oil ) with animal fats shortages in beef fat supply combined with advances by boyce and sabatier in the hydrogenation of plant materials soon accelerated the use of bradley 's method , and between 1900 and 1920 commercial oleomargarine was produced from a combination of animal fats and hardened and unhardened vegetable oils in the united states , problems with supply , coupled with changes in legislation , caused manufacturers to switch almost completely to vegetable oils and fats ( oleomargarine ) by 1950 , and the industry was ready for an era of product development around the 1930s and 1940s , arthur imhausen developed and implemented an industrial process in germany for producing edible fats by oxidizing synthetic paraffin wax made from coal margarine made from them was found to be nutritious and of agreeable taste , and it was incorporated into diets contributing as much as 700 calories per day in the mid-1960s , the introduction of two lower-fat blends of butter oil and vegetable oils in scandinavia , called lätt & lagom and bregott , clouded the issue of what should be called '' margarine '' and began the debate that led to the introduction of the term '' spread '' in 1978 , an 80 % fat product called krona , made by churning a blend of dairy cream and vegetable oils , was introduced in europe and , in 1982 , a blend of cream and vegetable oils called clover was introduced in the uk by the milk marketing board the vegetable oil and cream spread i ca n't believe it 's not butter ! was introduced into the united states in 1981 , and in the united kingdom and canada in 1991 most brands phased out the use of hydrogenated oils and became trans fat free many brands launched refrigerator-stable margarine spreads that contain only 1/3 of the fat and calorie content of traditional spreads other varieties of spreads include those with added omega-3 fatty acids , low or no salt , added phytosterol ( claimed to reduce blood cholesterol ) , olive oil , or certified vegan oils the basic method of making margarine today consists of emulsifying a blend of oils and fats from vegetable and animal sources , which can be modified using fractionation , interesterification or hydrogenation , with skimmed milk which may be fermented or soured , salt , citric or lactic acid , chilling the mixture to solidify it , and working it to improve the texture margarines and vegetable fat spreads found in the market can range from 10 % to 90 % fat , depending on dietary marketing and purpose ( spreading , cooking or baking ) technically , margarine is a form of shortening , but the commercial products sold as “ shortening ” are generally uncolored and do not taste like butter however , as there are possible health benefits in limiting the amount of saturated fats in the human diet , the process is controlled so that only enough of the bonds are hydrogenated to give the required texture if these particular bonds are not hydrogenated during the process , they remain present in the final margarine in molecules of trans fats , the consumption of which has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease for this reason , partially hardened fats are used less and less in the margarine industry the roles of butter and traditional margarine ( 80 % fat ) are similar with respect to their energy content , but low-fat margarines and spreads are also widely available during the manufacture of margarine , makers may convert some unsaturated fat into hydrogenated fats or trans fats to give them a higher melting point so they stay solid at room temperatures this is one of the two essential fatty acids , so called because humans can not manufacture it and must get it from food flax oil contains 30-50 % of ala , and is becoming a popular dietary supplement to rival fish oils ;
