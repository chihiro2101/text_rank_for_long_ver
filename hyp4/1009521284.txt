walter kaufmann lambasted this translation in the 1950s for two reasons : first , the failure of the english prefix '' super '' to capture the nuance of the german ( though in latin , its meaning of '' above '' or '' beyond '' is closer to the german ) ; and second , for promoting misidentification of nietzsche 's concept with the comic-book character superman a better translation like '' superior humans '' might better fit the concept of nietzsche as he unfolds his narrative ( 1961 ) , page 44 – english translation of zarathustra 's prologue ; '' i love those who do not first seek beyond the stars for reasons to go down and to be sacrifices : but who sacrifice themselves to the earth , that the earth may one day belong to the superman '' nietzsche , f zarathustra declares that the christian escape from this world also required the invention of an immortal soul separate from the earthly body . death of god and the creation of new values while the concept of god was the ultimate expression of other-worldly values and their underlying instincts , belief in god nevertheless did give meaning to life for a time '' god is dead '' means that the idea of god can no longer provide values instead , they must be motivated by a love of this world and of life whereas nietzsche diagnosed the christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense , the new values which the will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative ( see nietzschean affirmation ) all human life would be given meaning by how it advanced a new generation of human beings zarathustra contrasts the with the degenerate last man of egalitarian modernity , an alternative goal which humanity might set for itself for rüdiger safranski , the represents a higher biological type reached through artificial selection and at the same time is also an ideal for anyone who is creative and strong enough to master the whole spectrum of human potential , good and '' evil '' , to become an '' artist-tyrant '' according to safranski , nietzsche intended the ultra-aristocratic figure of the to serve as a machiavellian bogeyman of the modern western middle class and its pseudo-christian egalitarian value system the shares a place of prominence in thus spoke zarathustra with another of nietzsche 's key concepts : the eternal recurrence of the same the lies in the future — no historical figures have ever been — and so still represents a sort of eschatology redemption in some future time stanley rosen , on the other hand , suggests that the doctrine of eternal return is an esoteric ruse meant to save the concept of the from the charge of idealism rather than positing an as-yet unexperienced perfection , nietzsche would be the prophet of something that has occurred a countless number of times in the past the term was used frequently by hitler and the nazi regime to describe their idea of a biologically superior aryan or germanic master race ;

his disgust for the mindless social behavior of 'herds ' ; his anti-christianity ; his distrust of the effect of both the market and the state on cultural production ; his desire for an 'overman ' — that is , for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave ; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self , with the artist as his prototype , who could say , 'yes ' to the self-creation of a new world on the basis of nothing ; and his forwarding of the 'transvaluation of values ' as source of change , as opposed to a marxist conception of class struggle and the dialectic of a linear history '' the influential american anarchist emma goldman , in the preface of her famous collection anarchism and other essays , defends both nietzsche and max stirner from attacks within anarchism when she says '' the most disheartening tendency common among readers is to tear out one sentence from a work , as a criterion of the writer 's ideas or personality ( the ) economic component must be humanized precisely by bringing an 'affinity of friendship ' to the work process , by diminishing the role of onerous work in the lives of producers , indeed by a total 'transvaluation of values ' ( to use nietzsche 's phrase ) as it applies to production and consumption as well as social and personal life george bernard shaw 's 1903 play man and superman is a reference to the archetype ;
