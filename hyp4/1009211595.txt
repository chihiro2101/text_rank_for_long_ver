the election of gustav eriksson as a regent made many swedish nobles , who had so far stayed loyal to king christian , switch sides as a result , the swedish privy council lost old members who were replaced by supporters of gustav eriksson the new king openly claimed the swedish throne and had hopes lübeck would abandon the swedish rebels the ceremonial election of gustav as king of sweden took place when the leading men of sweden met in strängnäs in june 1523 in 1983 , in remembrance of the election of gustav as swedish king on 6 june , that date was declared the national day of sweden in domestic politics , eric 's ambitions were strongly opposed by the swedish nobility , including his half-brother , the later john iii of sweden ( 1537–92 ) eric 's most trusted counsellor , jöran persson ( 1530–68 ) , took much of the blame for the actions directed against the nobility during eric xiv 's reign and was executed shortly after john iii ascended to the throne his foreign policy was affected by his connection to poland ; his son sigismund iii vasa was made king of poland in 1587 in january 1569 , john was recognized as king by the same riksdag that forced eric xiv off the throne his polish connection came through his mother , daughter of sigismund i the old , and the jagiellonian dynasty had ruled poland and then the polish–lithuanian commonwealth since 1386 upon hearing of his election king sigismund slipped through the clutches of the protestants in sweden and landed in poland on 7 october it seemed that the issue of who would be king of poland had been settled when maximilian iii invaded at the head of his army to claim his crown the hostilities did not last long as hetman jan zamoyski at the head of a polish army loyal to king sigismund met and successfully defeated the austrian troops at the battle of byczyna and took maximilian iii as prisoner of war sigismund at that time was already the elected king of poland ( since 1587 ) sigismund certainly valued the swedish throne and upon learning about the death of his father , and the pretensions to the throne of his uncle , duke charles ix of sweden , he asked the sejm ( polish parliament ) for permission to leave the commonwealth and go to sweden , where he could secure the swedish crown the agreement of 19 february seemed to have calmed the situation ; sigismund was crowned in uppsala cathedral and became the king of sweden in july , sigismund left sweden in the hands of the regency council and returned to poland the new riksdag he summoned at arboga in 1597 – again despite the king 's orders – saw few participants , and only one from the privy council several of the privy council members fled to poland to convince sigismund to take counteractions charles at first looked ready to negotiate but in fact he was playing for time , trying to confirm his power at another riksdag ( in arboga ) , recruiting peasants for his army , and isolating sigismund 's followers in may 1599 , charles ' forces captured the last fortress held by sigismund , kalmar the new king of sweden was charles ix of sweden , and the polish–swedish union was dissolved after barely seven years of existence the second wave started in 1607 and lasted until 1609 , when tsar vasili made a military alliance with sweden in response to this alliance , the polish king sigismund iii decided to intervene officially and to declare war upon russia , aiming to weaken sweden 's ally and to gain territorial concessions after early commonwealth victories ( battle of klushino ) , which culminated in polish forces entering moscow in 1610 , sigismund 's son , prince władysław iv vasa , was briefly elected tsar the commonwealth gained some disputed territories in the truce of deulino , but władysław was never able to reign in russia ; the throne during this time was instead held by tsar michael romanov when the election result had been announced by the crown grand marshal , łukasz opaliński , the nobility ( szlachta ) , who had taken part in the election , began festivities in honor of the new king , which lasted three hours władysław used the title of the king of sweden , although he had no control over sweden whatsoever and never set foot in that country the reign of the last of the vasas in the polish–lithuanian commonwealth would be dominated by the russo-polish war ( 1654–67 ) , followed by the war with sweden ( '' the deluge '' ) , the scene for which had been set by the commonwealth 's two previous vasa kings although the reign of john casimir is remembered to be one of the most disastrous and perhaps most unsuccessful in the history of poland and the polish–lithuanian commonwealth , he is often referred to as the '' warrior king '' that fought bravely to save his nation and his people on 16 september 1668 , grief-stricken after the death of his wife in the previous year , john ii casimir abdicated the throne of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth , and returned to france , where he joined the jesuits and became abbot of abbey of saint-germain-des-prés in paris before his death john casimir intended to return to poland , however shortly before the journey in autumn 1672 he fell dangerously ill to the news of the fall of kamieniec podolski , which was seized by the ottomans he did not officially become king until 22 march 1604 the staunch protestant duke charles forced the catholic sigismund to let go of the throne of sweden in 1599 , a part of the preliminary religious strife before the thirty years ' war , and reigned as regent before taking the throne as charles ix of sweden in 1604 upon his father 's death in october 1611 , a sixteen-year-old gustavus inherited the throne ( declared of age and able to reign himself at seventeen as of 16 december ) , as well as an ongoing succession of occasionally belligerent dynastic disputes with his polish cousin his reign became famous from his actions a few years later when in june 1630 he landed in germany , marking the swedish intervention in the thirty years ' war gustavus intervened on the anti-imperial side , which at the time was losing to the holy roman empire and its catholic allies ; the swedish forces would quickly reverse that situation gustav ii adolf 's success in making sweden one of the great powers of europe , and perhaps the most important power in the thirty years ' war after france and spain , was due not only to his military brilliance , but also to important institutional reforms in sweden 's government his advancements in military science made sweden the dominant baltic power for the next one hundred years ( see swedish empire ) gustavus adolphus was the main figure responsible for the success of swedish arms during the thirty years ' war and led his nation to great prestige at the age of six she succeeded her father on the throne upon his death at the battle of lützen , and began ruling when she reached the age of 18 when sigismund ii of poland died without issue , the son of john iii of sweden and catherine jagellonka was elected king of poland and grand duke of lithuania as sigismund iii in 1587 on john 's death , sigismund also gained the swedish throne left however , sigismund was catholic , which ultimately led to his losing the throne in sweden we thus have two houses of vasa from this point onwards : the senior , catholic branch ruling in poland and lithuania , and the cadet , protestant branch ruling in sweden see also rulers of poland
