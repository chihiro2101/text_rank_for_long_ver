in photography this means that as one focuses closer , the lens ' effective aperture becomes smaller , making the exposure darker in the following quote , an '' apertal ratio '' of '' '' is calculated as the ratio of to , corresponding to an f-stop : in every lens there is , corresponding to a given apertal ratio ( that is , the ratio of the diameter of the stop to the focal length ) , a certain distance of a near object from it , between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus for instance , in a single view lens of 6-inch focus , with a in twenty feet is therefore called the 'focal range ' of the lens when this stop is used dallmeyer knew that his working aperture was not the same as the physical diameter of the aperture stop : it must be observed , however , that in order to find the real intensity ratio , the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained this is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses , or for double combination lenses used with the full opening , these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule ; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used , with stops inserted between the combinations , it is somewhat more troublesome ; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination according to an english review of his book , in 1894 , '' the necessity of clearly distinguishing between effective aperture and diameter of physical stop is strongly insisted upon at the same time , there were a number of aperture numbering systems designed with the goal of making exposure times vary in direct or inverse proportion with the aperture , rather than with the square of the f-number or inverse square of the apertal ratio or intensity ratio by 1895 , hodges contradicts bothamley , saying that the f-number system has taken over : '' this is called the x system , and the diaphragms of all modern lenses of good construction are so marked discusses five different systems of aperture marking : the old and new zeiss systems based on actual intensity ( proportional to reciprocal square of the f-number ) ; and the u.s he also sometimes uses expressions like '' an aperture of f 8 '' without the division indicated by the slash in modern publications , the forms f-number and f number are more common , though the earlier forms , as well as f-number are still found in a few books ; not uncommonly , the initial lower-case f in f-number or f/number is set in a hooked italic form : f , or f
