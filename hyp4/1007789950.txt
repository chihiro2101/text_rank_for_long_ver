according to livy , the first 100 men appointed as senators by romulus were referred to as '' fathers '' ( latin patres ) , and the descendants of those men became the patrician class the last-known instance of a gens being admitted to the patriciate prior to the 1st century bc was when the claudii were added to the ranks of the patricians after coming to rome in 504 bc , five years after the establishment of the republic the patricians were given noble status when named to the senate , giving them wider political influence than the plebs , at least in the times of the early republic this privilege was important in ancient roman history and ended up causing a large divide between the two classes this status difference was marked at the beginning of the republic : patricians were better represented in the roman assemblies , only patricians could hold high political offices , such as dictator , consul , and censor , and all priesthoods ( such as pontifex maximus ) were closed to non-patricians additionally , not only were the patricians of higher status in political offices but they also had the best land in ancient rome this view had political consequences , since in the beginning of the year or before a military campaign , roman magistrates used to consult the gods livy reports that the first admission of plebeians into a priestly college happened in 300 bc with the passage of the lex ogulnia , when the college of augurs raised their number from four to nine since society was organized in this way , the patrician class was essentially in complete control of ancient rome 's government for more on ancient rome 's social class distinction visit social class in ancient rome very few plebeian names appear in lists of roman magistrates during the early republic two laws passed during the fourth century bc began the gradual opening of magistrates to the plebeians : the lex licinia sextia of 367 bc , which established the right of plebeians to hold the consulship ; and the genucian law of 342 bc , which required that at least one of the consuls be a plebeian ( although this law was frequently violated for several decades ) many of the ancient patrician gentes whose members appear in the founding legends of rome disappeared as rome acquired its empire , and new plebeian families rose to prominence a number of patrician families such as the horatii , lucretii , verginii and menenii rarely appear in positions of importance during the later republic this time in roman history is called the conflict of the orders , which took place between 500-287 bce since the patricians were of high social status , they did not want to lose this status ; they were not in agreement with changing the structure of society by giving plebeians more status even once these laws were written down , and the new centuriate assembly was created , the patrician class remained in power a series of laws diminished the distinction between the two classes , including lex canuleia ( 445 bc ; which allowed the marriage—ius connubii—between patricians and plebeian ) , lex licinia sextia ( 367 bc ; which made restrictions on possession of public lands—ager publicus—and also made sure that one of the consuls was plebeian ) , lex ogulnia ( 300 bc ; plebeians received access to priest posts ) , and lex hortensia ( 287 bc ; verdicts of plebeian assemblies—plebiscita—now bind all people ) a short history of roman law '' patrician '' and '' plebeian '' are still used today to refer to groups of people of high and lower classes the following were regarded as patrician , although they may have had plebeian members or branches among the patricians , certain families were known as the , the greatest or perhaps the most noble houses in any case , the distinction can not have been based entirely on priority , because the claudii did not arrive at rome until after the expulsion of the kings patrician status still carried a degree of prestige at the time of the early roman empire , and roman emperors routinely elevated their supporters to the patrician caste en masse this prestige gradually declined further , and by the end of the 3rd-century crisis patrician status , as it had been known in the republic , ceased to have meaning in everyday life 306–337 ) reintroduced the term as the empire 's senior honorific title , not tied to any specific administrative position , and from the first limited to a very small number of holders however it remained one of the highest in the imperial hierarchy until the 11th century , being awarded to the most important ( provincial governors and generals ) of the empire the title of , '' first patrician '' ) is also evidenced in the east from 367 to 711 , possibly referring to the senior-most holder of the office and leader of the patrician order the laws of the roman people : public law in the expansion and decline of the roman republic
