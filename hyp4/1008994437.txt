the origins of the modern survivalist movement in the united kingdom and the united states include government policies , threats of nuclear warfare , religious beliefs , and writers who warned of social or economic collapse in both non-fiction and apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction the cold war era civil defense programs promoted public atomic bomb shelters , personal fallout shelters , and training for children , such as the duck and cover films the great depression that followed the wall street crash of 1929 is cited by survivalists as an example of the need to be prepared the increased inflation rate in the 1960s , the us monetary devaluation , the continued concern over a possible nuclear exchange between the us and the soviet union , and perceived increasing vulnerability of urban centers to supply shortages and other systems failures caused a number of primarily conservative and libertarian thinkers to promote individual preparations harry browne began offering seminars on how to survive a monetary collapse in 1967 , with don stephens ( an architect ) providing input on how to build and equip a remote survival retreat for several years the newsletter included a continuing section on personal preparedness written by stephens in the next decade howard ruff warned about socio-economic collapse in his 1974 book famine and survival in america in the previous decade , preparedness consultant , survival bookseller , and california-based author don stephens popularized the term retreater to describe those in the movement , referring to preparations to leave cities for remote havens or survival retreats should society break down after 28 years in circulation , the alpha strategy remains popular with survivalists , and is considered a standard reference on stocking food and household supplies as a hedge against inflation and future shortages further interest in the survivalist movement peaked in the early 1980s , with howard ruff 's book how to prosper during the coming bad years and the publication in 1980 of life after doomsday by bruce d clayton 's book , coinciding with a renewed arms race between the united states and soviet union , marked a shift in emphasis in preparations made by survivalists away from economic collapse , famine , and energy shortages—which were concerns in the 1970s—to nuclear war ragnar benson 's 1982 book live off the land in the city and country suggested rural survival retreats as both a preparedness measure and conscious lifestyle change north and others raised the alarm because they thought y2k code fixes were not being made quickly enough many books were published in the wake of the great recession from 2008 and later offering survival advice for various potential disasters , ranging from an energy shortage and crash to nuclear or biological terrorism he explained this phenomenon in a radio interview with jim puplava on december 18 , 2009 : this last aspect is highlighted in the trends research journal : '' communal spirit intelligently deployed is the core value of neo-survivalism '' during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic , which was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization in early 2020 , survivalism has received renewed interest , even by those who are not traditionally considered preppers the following are characterizations , although most ( if not all ) survivalists fit into more than one category : ; safety-preparedness-oriented while survivalists accept the long-term viability of western civilization , they learn principles and techniques needed for surviving life-threatening situations that can occur at any time and place ; self-defense-driven this group focuses on surviving brief encounters of violent activity , including personal protection and its legal ramifications , danger awareness , john boyd 's cycle ( also known as the ooda loop—observe , orient , decide and act ) , martial arts , self-defense tactics and tools ( both lethal and non-lethal ) while assuming the long-term continuity of society , some may have invested in a custom-built shelter , food , water , medicine , and enough supplies to get by until contact with the rest of the world resumes following a natural emergency ; natural disaster , prolonged this group is concerned with weather cycles of 2–10 years , which have happened historically and can cause crop failures ; biblical eschatologist these individuals study end time prophecy and believe that one of various scenarios might occur in their lifetime ; peak-oil doomers this group believes that peak oil is a near term threat to western civilization , and take appropriate measures , usually involving relocation to an agriculturally self-sufficient survival retreat some survivalists do not make such extensive preparations , and simply incorporate a '' scout motto '' outlook into their everyday life between 2013 and 2019 , many people purchased those same items in anticipation of widespread chaos following the 2016 election and the events leading up to the covid-19 pandemic instead of moving or making such preparations at home , many people also make plans to remain in their current locations until an actual breakdown occurs , when they will—in survivalist parlance— '' bug out '' or '' get out of dodge '' to a safer location people who are not part of survivalist groups or apolitically oriented religious groups also make preparations for emergencies '' he goes so far as to recommend setting up survival retreats : '' your safe haven must be self-sufficient and capable of growing some kind of food , '' mr even in america and europe , there could be moments of riot and rebellion when law and order temporarily completely breaks down they often use military acronyms such as opsec and sop , as well as terminology common among adherents to gun culture or the peak oil they also use terms that are unique to their own survivalist groups ; common acronyms include : alpha strategy : the practice of storing extra consumable items , as a hedge against inflation , and for use in barter and charity often used by those trying to show that they are experts in the preparedness field this requires skills as well as proper selection of equipment , as one can only carry so much refers to one who is prepared or making preparations the preparations of others ” zombie apocalypse : used by some preppers as a tongue-in-cheek metaphor for any natural or man-made disaster and '' a clever way of drawing people ’ s attention to disaster preparedness '' despite a lull following the end of the cold war , survivalism has gained greater attention in recent years , resulting in increased popularity of the survivalist lifestyle , as well as increased scrutiny a national geographic show interviewing survivalists , doomsday preppers , was a '' ratings bonanza '' and '' the network 's most-watched series '' , yet neil genzlinger in the new york times declared it an '' absurd excess on display and at what an easy target the prepper worldview is for ridicule , '' noting , '' how offensively anti-life these shows are , full of contempt for humankind gerald celente , founder of the trends research institute , noted how many modern survivalists deviate from the classic archetype , terming this new style '' neo-survivalism '' ; '' you know , the caricature , the guy with the ak-47 heading to the hills with enough ammunition and pork and beans to ride out the storm some survivalists do take active defensive preparations that have military roots and that involve firearms , and this aspect is sometimes emphasized by the mass media department of homeland security ( dhs ) in their '' if you see something , say something '' campaign says that '' the public should report only suspicious behavior and situations.rather than beliefs , thoughts , ideas , expressions , associations , or speech however , it is alleged that a dhs list of the characteristics of potential domestic terrorists used in law enforcement training includes '' survivalist literature ( fictional books such as patriots and one second after are mentioned by name ) '' , '' self-sufficiency ( stockpiling food , ammo , hand tools , medical supplies ) '' , and '' fear of economic collapse ( buying gold and barter items ) '' the missouri information analysis center ( miac ) issued on february 20 , 2009 a report intended for law enforcement personnel only entitled '' the modern militia movement , '' which described common symbols and media , including political bumper stickers , associated with militia members and domestic terrorists it was claimed that the report was derived purely from publicly available trend data on militias adherents of the back-to-the-land movement inspired by helen and scott nearing , sporadically popular in the united states in the 1930s and 1970s ( exemplified by the mother earth news magazine ) , share many of the same interests in self-sufficiency and preparedness despite these differences , the mother earth news was widely read by survivalists as well as back-to-the-landers during that magazine 's early years , and there was some overlap between the two movements some members of the men going their own way subculture also promote off-grid living and believe that modern society is no longer liveable ;
