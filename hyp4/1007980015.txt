at the same time , right after the death of menander , several indo-greek rulers also started to adopt on their coins the pƒÅli title of '' dharmikasa '' , meaning '' follower of the dharma '' ( the title of the great indian buddhist king ashoka was dharmaraja '' king of the dharma '' ) altogether , the conversion of menander to buddhism suggested by the milinda panha seems to have triggered the use of buddhist symbolism in one form or another on the coinage of close to half of the kings who succeeded him especially , all the kings after menander who are recorded to have ruled in gandhara ( apart from the little-known demetrius iii ) display buddhist symbolism in one form or another although the spread of buddhism to central asia and northern asia is usually associated with the kushans , a century or two later , there is a possibility that it may have been introduced in those areas from gandhara '' even earlier , during the time of demetrius and menander '' ( puri , '' buddhism in central asia '' ) consistently with this perspective , the actual depiction of the buddha would be a later phenomenon , usually dated to the 1st century , emerging from the sponsorship of the syncretic kushan empire and executed by greek , and , later , indian and possibly roman artists another possibility is that just as the indo-greeks routinely represented philosophers in statues ( but certainly not on coins ) in antiquity , the indo-greek may have initiated anthropomorphic representations of the buddha in statuary only , possibly as soon as the 2nd-1st century bc , as advocated by foucher and suggested by chinese murals depicting emperor wu of han worshipping buddha statues brought from central asia in 120 bc ( see picture ) an indo-chinese tradition also explains that nagasena , also known as menander 's buddhist teacher , created in 43 bc in the city of pataliputra a statue of the buddha , the emerald buddha , which was later brought to thailand the first known statues of the buddha are also very realistic and hellenistic in style and are more consistent with the pre-50 bc artistic level seen on coins this would tend to suggest that the first statues were created between 130 bc ( death of menander ) and 50 bc , precisely at the time when buddhist symbolism appeared on indo-greek coinage from that time , menander and his successors may have been the key propagators of buddhist ideas and representations : '' the spread of gandhari buddhism may have been stimulated by menander 's royal patronage , as may have the development and spread of gandharan sculpture , which seems to have accompanied it '' ( mcevilley , '' the shape of ancient thought '' , p
