bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms , including : excessive tooth wear , particularly attrition , which flattens the occlusal ( biting ) surface , but also possibly other types of tooth wear such as abfraction , where notches form around the neck of the teeth at the gumline inflammation of the periodontal ligament of teeth , which may make them sore to bite on , and possibly also a degree of loosening of the teeth tenderness , pain or fatigue of the muscles of mastication , which may get worse during chewing or other jaw movement bruxism is usually detected because of the effects of the process ( most commonly tooth wear and pain ) , rather than the process itself tooth wear caused by tooth-to-tooth contact is termed attrition if enough of the tooth is worn away or decayed , the tooth will effectively be weakened , and may fracture under the increased forces that occur in bruxism abfraction cavities are said to occur usually on the facial aspect of teeth , in the cervical region as v-shaped defects caused by flexing of the tooth under occlusal forces it is thought that the periodontal ligament may respond to increased occlusal ( biting ) forces by resorbing some of the bone of the alveolar crest , which may result in increased tooth mobility , however these changes are reversible if the occlusal force is reduced it is generally accepted that increased occlusal forces are able to increase the rate of progression of pre-existing periodontal disease ( gum disease ) , however the main stay treatment is plaque control rather than elaborate occlusal adjustments it is also generally accepted that periodontal disease is a far more common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism , although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both the temporomandibular joints themselves may also become painful , which is usually felt just in front of the ear , or inside the ear itself the forces exerted on the teeth are more than the periodontal ligament is biologically designed to handle , and so inflammation may result normally during sleep , the voluntary muscles are inactive due to physiologic motor paralysis , and the jaw is usually open
