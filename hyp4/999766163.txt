bonitto , brian ( 2012 ) '' king tubby , the sound creator '' , jamaica observer , 6 july 2012 , retrieved 13 july 2012 it became a crowd favourite due to the high quality sound of his equipment , exclusive releases and tubby 's own echo and reverb sound effects , at that point something of a novelty the sound also launched the career of u-roy , its featured toaster reid , one of the major figures in early jamaican music alongside rival coxsone dodd , ran treasure isle studios , one of jamaica 's first independent production houses , and was a key producer of ska , rocksteady and eventually reggae recordings when tubby was asked to produce versions of songs for sound system mcs or toasters , tubby initially worked to remove the vocal tracks with the faders on reid 's mixing desk , but soon discovered that the various instrumental tracks could be accentuated , reworked and emphasised through the settings on the mixer and primitive early effects units partly due to the popularity of these early remixes , in 1971 , tubby 's soundsystem consolidated its position as one of the most popular in kingston and tubby decided to open a studio of his own in waterhouse in 1971 , initially using a 4-track mixer purchased from byron lee 's dynamic studio with a variety of effects units connected to his mixer , tubby '' played '' the mixing desk like an instrument , bringing instruments and vocals in and out of the mix ( literally '' dubbing '' them ) to create an entirely new genre known as dub music these techniques mirrored the actions of the sound system selectors ( reggae disc jockeys ) , who had long used eq equipment to emphasise certain aspects of particular records , but tubby used his custom-built studio to take this technique into new areas , often transforming a hit song to the point where it was almost unrecognisable from the original version in 1973 , he added a second 4-track mixer , and built a vocal booth at his studio so he could record vocal tracks onto the instrumental tapes brought to him by various producers when tubby completed the dub , which also featured augustus pablo on melodica , barrett 's drums regenerated several times and created a totally new rhythm which was later tagged '' rockers '' by the later part of the 1970s , king tubby had mostly retired from music , still occasionally mixing dubs and tutoring a new generation of artists , including king jammy and perhaps his greatest protege , hopeton brown a.k.a
