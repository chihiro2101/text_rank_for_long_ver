following a french and indian war french victories , 1756–1757 , coupled with military setbacks in europe , william pitt gained full control of the direction of british military efforts in the seven years ' war as early as march , louis-joseph de montcalm , the commanding general responsible of the french forces in north america , and the marquis de vaudreuil , new france 's governor , were aware that the british were planning to send large numbers of troops against them , and that they would have relatively little support from king louis xv of france 92 the lack of support from france was in large part due to an unwillingness of the french military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the atlantic ocean , which was dominated by britain 's royal navy vaudreuil , who had limited combat experience , wanted to divide the french forces , with about 5,000 each at carillon and louisbourg , and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the british in the mohawk river on the northwestern frontiers of the province of new york the british amassed their army , under the command of general james abercrombie , near the remains of fort william henry , which lay at the southern end of lake george but had been destroyed following its capture by the french the previous year the army numbered fully 16,000 men , making it the largest single force ever deployed in north america at the time he had sent a messenger bearing a letter from vaudreuil to abercrombie ( part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders ) on june 10 , expecting him to return ; the fact that the british held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the british camp 106–107 montcalm arrived at fort carillon on june 30 , and found there a significantly under-staffed garrison , with only 3,500 men , and food sufficient for only nine days given the large force facing him and the defects of the fort 's site , montcalm opted for a strategy of defending the likely approaches to the fort 162 he also sent word back to montreal of the situation , requesting that , if possible , the chevalier de lévis and his men , be sent as reinforcement ; these were troops that vaudreuil intended for duty at the western frontier forts 108 when word reached bourlamaque on july 5 that the british fleet was coming , he sent captain trépezet and about 350 & nbsp ; men to observe the fleet , and , if possible , to prevent their landing on learning the size of the british fleet , which was reportedly '' large enough to cover the face of lake george '' , andersonmade , p 163 these withdrawals isolated trépezet and his men from the main body , a situation made worse for trépezet when his indian guides , alarmed by the size of the british fleet , abandoned him 51 beginning on the evening of july 6 , the french began to lay out entrenchments on the rise northwest of the fort , about away , that commanded the land routes to the fort abercrombie first landed an advance force to check the area where the forces were to disembark , and found it recently deserted ; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the french in their hasty departure general howe 's column was near the action , so he led it in that direction a column of massachusetts provincials , also drawn to the battle , cut off the french patrol 's rear after ascending rattlesnake hill ( as mount defiance was then known ) , they reported that the french position appeared to be incomplete , and could be '' easily forced , even without cannon '' 142 early on the morning of july 8 , clerk went out once again to the base of rattlesnake hill to observe the french defenses ; his report indicated that he still felt the french lines could be taken by assault they were followed by provincials from new york and massachusetts , and then three columns of regulars , who made their way through the provincial formations to begin the attack while abercrombie had expected the battle to begin at 1 pm , by 12:30 elements of the new york regiments on the left began engaging the french defenders 64 the sounds of battle led haviland to believe that the french line might have been penetrated , so he ordered his men forward , even though not all of the regulars were in place , and abercrombie had not given an order to advance 151–153 the french position was such that they were able to lay down withering fire on the british forces as they advanced , and the abatis ( a word that shares derivation with abattoir , or slaughterhouse ) rapidly became a killing field 70–71 montcalm was active on the battlefield , having removed his coat , and was moving among his men , giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met 156 and to have approached the front of the french lines at one point early in the battle this brought them within range of the french left and some of the fort 's guns 71–72 abercrombie ordered his reserves , the connecticut and new jersey provincials , into the battle around 2 , but by 2:30 it was clear their attack also failed abercrombie then tried to recall the troops , but a significant number , notably the 42nd and 46th regiments on the british left , persisted in the attack 76–80 one british observer noted that '' our forces fell exceeding fast '' , while another wrote that they were '' cut down like grass '' 246 finally realizing the scope of the disaster , abercrombie ordered the troops to muster and march down to the landing on lake george montcalm , wary of a second british attack , and concerned about the fatigue of his troops after a long day of battle , had barrels of beer and wine brought forward to the lines although he was active at lake george , he did little more than provide support for john bradstreet 's battle of fort frontenac , which was authorized in a war council on july 13 168 william pitt , the british secretary of state who had designed the british military strategy and received word of the defeat in august , wrote to abercrombie on september 18 that the '' king has judged proper that you should return to england 317–318 however , the king did not learn of the regiment 's loss of almost half its strength in this battle until august he apparently never inspected the landing area at the north end of lake george , which was a location from which he could contest the british landing nester estimates that contesting the first crossing on the portage road would have gained montcalm an additional day for defensive preparations the same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort , a sign that a siege would have ended quickly 144 captain charles lee of the 44th foot wrote , on the prospect of using cannon on rattlesnake hill , '' there was one hill in particular , which seem 'd to offer itself as an ally to us , it immediately commanded the lines from hence two small cannon well planted must have drove the french in a very short time from their breast work abercrombie also had the option to avoid a pitched battle , instead beginning siege operations against the french position in fact , the french twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the british attackers an experienced commander could easily have encamped at the lake george landing , taken stock of the situation , and begun siege operations against the french abercrombie , to the surprise of some in his army , ordered a retreat all the way back to the south end of lake george even though the fort was effectively battle of ticonderoga ( 1759 ) , future defenders of the fort and their superior officers , who may not have been familiar with the site 's shortcomings , fell under the spell of this idea 51 anthony wayne , who was at fort ticonderoga preparing its defenses before burgoyne 's arrival , wrote to washington that the fort '' can never be carried , without much loss of blood ''
