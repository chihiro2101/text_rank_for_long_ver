an article in the new york times called ferguson 's actions '' as methodical as if he were taking tickets the couple moved to a house on long island where they often fought , sometimes to the point that police intervention was required ferguson got a job doing clerical work for the ademco security group in syosset , new york on long island also that year , he was forced to leave a class after a disciplinary hearing board found that he had acted overly aggressively towards the teacher on one occasion , he complained that a white woman in the library shouted racial epithets at him after he asked her about a class assignment , but an investigation concluded that the incident never occurred ferguson interrupted the professor by shouting , '' we should be talking about the revolution in south africa and how to get rid of the white people '' and '' kill everybody white ! '' students and teachers tried to quieten him , but he started threatening them , repeatedly saying , '' the black revolution will get you ferguson tried to escape the police and shouted , '' brothers , come help me ! '' he sent letters to the new york city police commissioner and other officials complaining about his arrest , describing it as '' viscous and racist , '' and claiming that he was brutalized by the officers who arrested him in april 1993 , he insisted that he was still in pain and demanded that the case be reopened so that he could get more money for medical treatment in the following weeks , ferguson visited a manhattan law firm for a consultation , and attorney lauren abramson said that she immediately felt uncomfortable and threatened by him months later , he made threatening calls to members of the firm , claiming that they were discriminating against him ferguson tried to have his workers ' compensation claim reopened by the new york state workers ' compensation board , which reexamined the case due to his persistence , but it was ultimately rejected he presented himself as a california resident by providing a driver 's license that he received two months earlier , which had an address of the long beach motel where he stayed ferguson moved back to new york in may 1993 because , as he told a friend , he did not like competing with immigrants and hispanics for jobs police detectives later said it appeared ferguson had been planning the shooting for more than a week lirr police chief joseph flynn said , '' this was the work of a deranged , maniacal person who for a variety of reasons decided to explode ferguson 's notes expressed anger towards the new york state workers ' compensation board , asians , governor mario cuomo , and '' so-called civil right leaders such as the rev governor , the attorney general , and the manhattan law firm that ferguson had previously threatened , whom he referred to as '' those corrupt 'black ' attorneys who not only refuse to help me but tried to steal my car '' the notes indicated ferguson planned to wait to start the killings until he was beyond the new york city limit out of respect for outgoing mayor david dinkins and police commissioner raymond w president bill clinton took notice of the lirr shooting , calling it a '' terrible human tragedy '' the day after the shooting , clinton announced he had asked attorney general janet reno to review a proposal by new york city mayor-elect rudy giuliani that would set up a national uniform licensing system for gun buyers during his first major speech since his election as mayor , giuliani cited the ferguson murders while he repeated his previous calls for the death penalty and a uniform gun licensing law senator al d'amato said the ferguson case demonstrated the need for capital punishment in new york state because '' that is the only fitting punishment for this cold-blooded killer '' jackson stressed the shootings were the result of one man and should not be seen as indicative of all african-americans '' jackson and other african-american leaders criticized the comment as racially charged , but gulotta later said his statement had nothing to do with race during a press conference in the days after the shooting , the long island rail road police benevolent association called the trains '' unsafe '' and said the railroad needed to triple the size of its 216-person police force a new york times editorial called for stronger gun control laws in response to the murders , specifically citing the ease with which ferguson obtained a handgun in california , which had one of the country 's stricter gun laws several adelphi university students expressed concern that ferguson may have been taking the train to the school with plans of shooting people out of revenge for his past experiences there , although the train ferguson took was not the closest one to adelphi under new york state law , an insanity defense would require ferguson 's lawyers to prove he suffers from a mental disease or defect and , as a result , could not tell whether his actions were right or wrong at the time , lawyers and mental health experts said such a defense would be difficult because ferguson appeared to have carefully planned the attacks , and because he said , '' oh god , what did i do '' after he was stopped before a ruling was even made on the request , moore held a press conference announcing he would seek a change of venue to brooklyn , claiming it was impossible for ferguson to receive a fair trial in a nassau court due to a '' severe underrepresentation of african-americans on the nassau county jury panel '' later , moore withdrew his offer to represent ferguson , citing conflicts he did not explain belfi rejected the gag order on april 23 , claiming the impact of inflammatory statements already made by lawyers , politicians and police would fade in the months before the trial begins however , belfi warned attorneys from both sides to follow a state court professional disciplinary rule that already limits their comments to news organizations when i suffered and screamed i was told that it was a good sign by the prison guards because they were hoping for my swift departure from life '' later , ron kuby argued ferguson had been a frequent target of harassment at the nassau county jail , and requested the united states department of justice intervene to ensure ferguson 's safety in november 1994 , ferguson 's lawyers claimed prison guards taunted him with claims that the election of governor george pataki , a death penalty supporter , meant ferguson would be executed if found guilty ferguson 's lawyers claimed prison guards showed him the headlines of newspaper stories about pataki and claimed ferguson was '' headed for electrocution sometime soon '' ferguson was deeply troubled by the claims , despite assurances from his attorneys that the death penalty could only be imposed in crimes committed after a capital punishment bill became law ferguson started to claim he was not involved in the long island rail road shootings at all , and repeatedly refused to meet with a psychiatrist chosen by kunstler and kuby ferguson claimed a police officer who escorted him from the nassau county jail said to him ; '' you realize someone else , in fact , was actually responsible for the shooting denis dillon suggested kunstler was trying to create '' such a bizarre situation '' that the court would reverse its earlier ruling regarding ferguson 's competence although george peck argued the letters proved ferguson was able to understand the charges against him and was actively participating in his defense , kuby argued the letters only further demonstrated ferguson 's confused state of mind belfi said he based his decision in part on his conversations with ferguson in the courtroom , including ferguson 's concern over governor pataki 's promise to sign a death-penalty bill ferguson , evidence to the contrary , believes he is not guilty and that someone else killed all those people aboard the train simpson murder case , going on simultaneously on the west coast he also found another man who was willing to testify the government implanted a computer chip in ferguson 's brain , but at the last minute decided not to call him to the stand this individual , raul diaz , was a parapsychology from manhattan and claimed during a press conference on the courthouse steps to have witnessed an oriental man press a chip into ferguson 's head prior to the attack '' and would simply force the witness to repeat testimony already given '' during the course of his cross-examinations , ferguson would refer to himself in the illeism , most particularly asking the victims of the shooting ; '' did you see colin ferguson & nbsp ; ferguson originally sought to question himself on the witness stand , but ultimately did not do so he told the judge and media outlets he intended to call a number of witnesses who would prove his innocence , including a ballistic expert , a handwriting expert and two regular eyewitnesses , but they were afraid to come forward and take the stand the judge said , '' colin ferguson will never return to society , and will spend the rest of his natural life in prison '' he also used the sentencing as an opportunity to criticize new york 's controversial sentencing cap law , which would have capped ferguson 's sentence at 50 years had no one died in the massacre because all of the felonies he committed on the train were part of one occurrence , therefore all sentences would have been served concurrently and capped at 50 years carolyn mccarthy — whose husband dennis mccarthy was killed by ferguson , and whose son kevin mccarthy was severely injured — was subsequently elected to the united states congress , on a platform of gun control some of ferguson 's other victims and their family members have also become involved in gun control
