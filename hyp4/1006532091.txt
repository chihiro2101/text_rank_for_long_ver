the use of a smoothbore weapon would have allowed challenger 2 to use nato standard ammunition developed in germany and the us in may 2007 , the ministry of defence 's future systems group invited baes to tender for the challenger 2 capability sustainment program ( c2 csp ) , which combined all upgrades into one programme the challenger 2 life extension programme ( lep ) is designed to replace obsolete equipment , enhance protection , increase range and provide improved lethality of the tank until an out of service date of 2035 - extending its life from 2025 a royal tank regiment ( rtr ) newsletter dated december 2015 stated that the lep includes managing to curb obsolescence in several turret systems – including ti sights , the fire control computer ( fcc ) and electronic architecture in turret improved technology will be integrated as a new system on the platform , which will deliver more accurate engagements at range and improved fcc power , meaning that cr2 will remain a '' battle winning '' asset out to the extended out of service date parallel work strands will provide extensions to virtual training systems , deliver improved live fire monitoring equipment ( lfme ) and work is ongoing to develop improved 120 & nbsp ; mm ammunition the full scope of the lep is indicated as being broken down into four areas : surveillance and target acquisition : updated commanders primary sight , updated gunners primary sight , replacement thermal observation and gunnery sights ( togs ) and , 3rd generation thermal imaging ( ti ) weapon control system : fire control computer ( fcc ) , fire control panel ( fcp ) and , gun processing unit ( gpu ) mobility ( through in-service efficiencies ) : 3rd generation ( horstman ) hydrogas suspension , improved air filtration , cv-12 common rail fuel injection , transmission and , cooling active protection systems ( aps ) for armoured vehicles in the uk armed forces ( including the challenger 2 ) are being assessed by the uk defence science and technical laboratory ( dstl ) as part of the medusa technical assessment programme , this includes the muss system in 2017 a challenger 2 was also fitted with a rheinmetall rosy rapid obscurant system including parts from the israeli military industries ( imi ) iron fist hard-kill aps for development and assessment by the dstl around this time a separate two-year contract was awarded to bae systems and krauss maffei wegmann to develop an update to the bridging variant in part to address the increase in weight of the challenger 2 from 64t to 75t arising from upgrades made during the iraq campaign the lep will see the replacement of most of the tanks electronics , including its sighting systems but does not envisage a major upgrade of the vehicle 's drive systems or replacement of the 120 & nbsp ; mm l30a1 rifled gun the black night challenger 2 turret has been modified to improve the speed of traverse and provides greater space as well as regenerative braking to generate and store power the company ’ s solution has been to develop a completely new turret which has a fully digital electronic architecture , new day and night sights for the commander and gunner , and a rheinmetall l55 smoothbore 120 & nbsp ; mm gun in october 2020 , the mod argued that the challenger 2 lep was a better course of action than purchasing similar tanks in nato armies , and that the upgraded challenger 2 would be '' comparable – and in certain areas superior '' to the leopard 2 and abrams haaip has already led to upgrades to the air filtration system , through the use of cleanable air filters with increased operating life , which were tested in exercise saif sareea 3 in october 2018 the cv12 upgrade by caterpillar defense would fit electronically controlled common rail fuel injection and introduce engine health monitoring ( hums ) the smaller volume but more powerful europowerpack power pack additionally incorporates as standard a cooling system and air-intake filtration system proved in desert use it was later determined that a bolt vent axial ( bva ) seal assembly had been removed during an earlier exercise and had yet to be replaced at the time of the incident , thus allowing explosive gases to enter the turret space ; the lack of a written process for removal and replacement of the seal assembly meant that the crew at the time of the incident was unaware of its absence , and it was also noted that inadequate consideration had been given during the production of the l30 gun as to whether it could be fired without the seal assembly
