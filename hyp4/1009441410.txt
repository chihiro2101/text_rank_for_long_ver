gravano was sent to a school for '' incorrigibles '' ; however , just before he reached the age of 16 , the school refused to keep him any longer gravano 's father tried to redirect and discipline his son , including forcing him to attend mass , but had little success later in his mob career , gravano was ordered to help arrange the murder of his brother-in-law , nicholas scibetta gravano became a particular favorite of family boss joe colombo , who used gravano to picket the fbi manhattan headquarters as part of his italian-american civil rights league initiative in the early 1970s , colombo soldier ralph spero , brother of shorty , became envious of gravano 's success , fearing that he would become a made man before his son , tommy after ronga 's death , a rumor had spread that gravano had attempted to pick up ronga 's widow sybil davies at a bar , though gravano maintained that davies was the one hitting on him while shorty spero believed gravano rather than ralph , he and the colombo hierarchy decided that to avoid conflict , it was best for gravano to leave the colombo family and join the gambino crime family aurello quickly took a liking to gravano and became his mob mentor around this time , gravano took a construction job ( he later claimed to have considered leaving the criminal life ) a former associate , however , falsely claimed to the new york county district attorney that gravano and another associate were responsible for a double murder from 1969 gravano later said of this legal problem : that pinch ( arrest ) changed my whole life gravano 's robbery spree impressed aurello , who proposed him for membership in the gambino family soon after the membership books were reopened in 1976 , gravano was formally initiated into the gambino family as a made man when advised of scibetta 's fate , a furious gravano said he would kill castellano first gravano then went to castellano and received permission to murder the leader of the gang the commission subsequently contract killing on caponigro 's co-conspirators , including john '' johnny keys '' simone , who also happened to be bruno 's cousin later that night , gravano confronted fiala on the street as he exited the plaza suite among a group of people , asking , '' hey , frank , how you doing ? '' as fiala turned around , surprised to see gravano , milito came up behind him and shot him in the head gravano was never charged for the crime ; he had made a 5,000 payoff to the lead new york police department homicide detective louis eppolito to ensure that the investigation yielded no leads gravano attempted to lie low for nearly three weeks afterwards , during which time he called his crew together and made the decision to kill castellano if necessary gravano , however , was spared execution when he convinced castellano that the reason he had kept him in the dark was to protect the boss in case something went wrong with the hit '' gravano eventually became embroiled in a dispute with business partner louie dibono , a member of another gambino crew gambino underboss neil dellacroce intervened on gravano 's behalf and castellano told the two men to end their business partnership , though gravano 's standing with the boss slipped as a result of the incident during this time , the fbi had intensified its efforts against the gambino family and in august 1983 , three members of gotti 's crew – angelo ruggiero , john carneglia , and gene gotti – were indicted for heroin trafficking eventually , one of the reasons for gotti 's killing castellano was to save his brother and ruggiero when castellano was indicted for both his connection to roy demeo 's stolen car ring and as part of the mafia commission trial , he learned his own house had been bugged on the basis of evidence from the ruggiero tapes and he became livid three months later , gravano was approached by robert dibernardo , a fellow gambino member acting as an intermediary for gotti neither man appealed to gravano or decicco as leadership material , and they ultimately decided to support the hit on castellano decicco and gravano , however , also made a secret pact to kill gotti and take over the family as boss and underboss , respectively , if they were unhappy with gotti 's leadership after one year it has long been a hard and fast rule in the mafia that killing a boss is forbidden without the support of a majority of the commission indeed , gotti 's planned hit would have been the first off-the-record hit on a boss since frank costello was nearly killed in 1957 they did not even consider approaching the genoveses ; castellano had especially close ties with genovese boss vincent gigante , and approaching any major genovese figure , even one of their generation , could have been a tipoff however , it was an open secret that gotti was acting boss in all but name , and nearly all of the family 's capos knew he had been the one behind the hit the first person on gravano 's hit list after castellano 's murder was nicholas mormando , a former member of his crew according to gravano , mormando started to act '' like a renegade he was forced to rely heavily on gravano , angelo ruggiero , and joseph armone to manage the family 's day-to-day affairs while he called the major shots from his jail cell in june , gravano was approached by ruggiero and , supposedly at gotti 's behest , given orders to murder capo robert dibernardo for making negative remarks about gotti 's leadership gravano was friendly with dibernardo and tried to get the murder called off until he had a chance to speak with gotti after his trial ruggiero claimed to have met again with gotti and told gravano that the boss wanted dibernardo killed right away gravano later learned that ruggiero was 250,000 in debt to dibernardo and realized ruggiero may have fabricated the orders from gotti or simply lied to gotti about what dibernardo was accused of saying in order to erase the debt and improve his own standing in the family in any event , dibernardo 's death proved profitable for gravano , as he took over the deceased man 's control of teamsters local 282 159 with gotti standing trial alongside his brother gene '' willie boy '' johnson ( who , despite being exposed as an informant , refused to turn state 's evidence raab , p nevertheless , gravano claimed to be kicking up over 2 & nbsp ; million each year to gotti out of his union activities alone 389–390 leaving gravano disillusioned with the mob and doubtful on his chances of winning his case without shargel , his former attorney 413 he was the first member of the hierarchy of a new york crime family to turn informer , and the second confessed underboss in the history of the american mafia to do so after the philadelphia crime family 's phil leonetti 422 prosecutors andrew maloney and john gleeson began their case by playing tapes showing gotti discussing gambino family business , including murders he approved , and confirming the animosity between gotti and castellano to establish the former 's motive to kill his boss 412–421 after calling an eyewitness of the sparks hit who identified carneglia as one of the men who shot bilotti , they then brought gravano to testify on march 2 425–426 on the stand , gravano confirmed gotti 's place in the structure of the gambino family and described in detail the conspiracy to assassinate castellano , giving a full description of the hit and its aftermath gotti surrendered to federal authorities to serve his prison time on december 14 , 1992 however , since gravano had already served four years , the sentence amounted to less than one year later in 1994 , gravano was released early and entered the u.s a federal prosecutor later said that gravano did not like the constraints of the program at this time , gravano also hired a publicist , despite the fact gravano complained often about the publicity-seeking gotti also in 1997 , new york state took legal action to seize gravano 's profits from the book during an interview gravano had with the newspaper the arizona republic , he claimed federal agents he had met after becoming a government witness had become his personal friends and even visited him in arizona while on vacation gravano later claimed that he did n't want the republic to publish the story , but relented after the paper allegedly threatened to reveal that his family was living with him in phoenix the story so incensed his former mob compatriots that they forced the gambinos to put a murder contract on him in february 2000 , gravano and nearly 40 other ring members—including his ex-wife debra , daughter karen , and gerard—were arrested on federal and state drug charges on september 7 , 2002 , after numerous delays , gravano was sentenced in new york to 20 years in prison a month later , he was also sentenced in arizona to 19 years in prison to run concurrently gravano denied any involvement in calabro 's death and rejected a plea deal , under which he would have received no additional jail time if he confessed to the crime and implicated all his accomplices
