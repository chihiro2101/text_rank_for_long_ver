vocabulary is commonly defined as '' all the words known and used by a particular person '' the first major change distinction that must be made when evaluating word knowledge is whether the knowledge is productive ( also called achieve ) or receptive ( also called receive ) ; even within those opposing categories , there is often no clear distinction these words may range from well-known to barely known ( see degree of knowledge below ) for example , although a young child may not yet be able to speak , write , or sign , he or she may be able to follow simple commands and appear to understand a good portion of the language to which they are exposed in this case , the child 's receptive vocabulary is likely tens , if not hundreds of words , but his or her active vocabulary is zero it is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary , for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure , and can produce them , but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation productive vocabulary , therefore , generally refers to words that can be produced within an appropriate context and match the intended meaning of the speaker or signer as with receptive vocabulary , however , there are many degrees at which a particular word may be considered part of an active vocabulary this simply indicates that a word gradually enters a person 's vocabulary over a period of time as more aspects of word knowledge are learnt another definition often used in research of vocabulary size is that of word family brysbaert m , stevens m , mandera p and keuleers e ( 2016 ) how many words do we know ? practical estimates of vocabulary size dependent on word definition , the degree of language input and the participant 's age this is generally the largest type of vocabulary simply because a reader tends to be exposed to more words by reading than by listening writers generally use a limited set of words when communicating for example , if there are a number of synonyms , a writer may have a preference as to which of them to use , and they are unlikely to use technical vocabulary relating to a subject in which they have no knowledge or interest once the reading and writing vocabularies start to develop , through questions and education , the child starts to discover the anomalies and irregularities of language a person may be judged by others based on his or her vocabulary estimating average vocabulary size poses various difficulties and limitations due to the different definitions and methods employed such as what is the word , what is to know a word , what sample dictionaries were used , how tests were conducted , and so on vocabulary learning is one of the first steps in learning a second language , but a learner never finishes vocabulary acquisition whether in one 's native language or a second language , the acquisition of new vocabulary is an ongoing process although memorization can be seen as tedious or boring , associating one word in the native language with the corresponding word in the second language until memorized is considered one of the best methods of vocabulary acquisition when a word in the second language is phonologically or visually similar to a word in the native language , one often assumes they also share similar meanings if a second language learner relies solely on word associations to learn new vocabulary , that person will have a very difficult time mastering false friends when large amounts of vocabulary must be acquired in a limited amount of time , when the learner needs to recall information quickly , when words represent abstract concepts or are difficult to picture in a mental image , or when discriminating between false friends , rote memorization is the method to use if time is available or one wants to emphasize a few key words , one can create mnemonic devices or word associations however , this method is best for words that represent concrete and imageable things several word lists have been developed to provide people with a limited vocabulary either for the purpose of rapid language proficiency or for effective communication
