but jaffee was asked to do a second installment , and soon the fold-in became a recurring feature on the inside back cover of the magazine it 's so simplistic and silly and juvenile ! and anyone could have done that ! : i showed it to al feldstein , and the first thing i said was , '' al , i 've got this crazy idea , and you 're not going to buy it , because it mutilates the magazine '' he takes it , runs it to bill 's office , and he was there a little while , and he comes back and he says , '' we 're going to do it ! you know what bill said ? bill said , 'so they mutilate the magazine , and then they 'll buy another one to save ! ' : four or five weeks later , al comes over to me and says , '' when are you going to do the next fold-in ? '' and i said , '' i do n't have another fold-in '' the boston phoenix the fold-in became one of mads signature features , and appeared in almost every issue of the magazine from 1964–2020 a single issue in 1977 was published without a fold-in ( though jaffee supplied the issue 's back cover ) , and a 1980 issue instead featured a unique double-visual gimmick by jaffee in which the inside back cover and the outside back cover merged to create a third image when held up to the light in a mad-like wrinkle , there are two answers to the question '' when was jaffee 's last fold-in ? '' the final one he designed appeared in the june 2019 issue jaffee had prepared it six years in advance , to be published after his own death instead , it ran after he officially announced his retirement at the age of 99 , as the conclusion of an '' all jaffee '' tribute issue the far side creator gary larson described his experience with the fold-in : '' the dilemma was always this : very slowly and carefully fold the back cover & nbsp ; otherwise , all his work is done by hand '' in 2008 , jaffee told one newspaper , '' i never see the finished painting folded until it 's printed in the magazine i guess i have that kind of visual mind where i can see the two sides without actually putting them together '' contrasting current art techniques and jaffee 's approach , mads art director , sam viviano , said , '' i think part of the brilliance of the fold-in is lost on the younger generations who are so used to photoshop and being able to do stuff like that on a computer until 2019 , jaffee continued to do the fold-in for mad , as well as additional artwork for articles since august 2019 , mad has been either reprinting old fold-ins or publishing new ones by johnny sampson in december 2019 , al 's original work was featured in the magazine for the last time mads oldest regular contributor , jaffee 's work appeared in 500 of the magazine 's first 550 issues , a total unmatched by any other writer or artist he has said , '' i work for a magazine that 's essentially for young people , and to have them keep me going , i feel very lucky & nbsp ; '' inside mad , time home entertainment inc he thinks that way because he is not only an artist , but a technician as well referring to the latter , jaffee said , '' i was going through a divorce when i started that when designing his mad fold-ins , jaffee starts with the finished '' answer '' to the fold-in , and then spreads it apart and places a piece of tracing paper over it in order to fill in the center '' throw-away '' aspect of the image , which is covered up when the page is folded over , using regular pencil at this stage in 2005 , the production company motion theory created a video for recording artist beck 's song '' girl '' using jaffee 's mad fold-ins as inspiration ; jaffee 's name appears briefly in the video , on a television screen the cake featured the salutary message '' al , you have repeatedly shown artistry & care of great credit to your field in 2010 , he recalled : : i got a call from the daily show & nbsp ; – they asked me if i would contribute a fold-in to their book , america when i was done , i called up the producer who 'd contacted me , and i said , '' i 've finished the fold-in , where shall i send it ? '' and he said & nbsp ; – and this was a great compliment & nbsp ; – '' oh , please mr jaffee , who worked for eisner in his studio for one of his earliest jobs , was not present during the convention , and the award was accepted by mad art director sam viviano , who presented it to jaffee at a later date guinness noted that he had worked continuously , beginning with jaffee 's contribution to the december 1942 issue of joker comics and continuing through the april 2016 issue of mad magazine his oldest younger brother harry jaffee ( 1922–1985 ) , who also had artistic talent , had long been coping with various illnesses—for a time he had been committed to bellevue in addition to reprints of his past work , jaffee joined weisman in telling his life story with more than 70 color illustrations depicting his childhood and later years
