when the railway branch line was built , a bridge over the canal was made , and this bridge can still be seen , showing the alignment of the canal at its lower termination the canal ran on the east side of the river , except between a point below plashford bridge to near landreast bridge , the present day railway branch line closely follows the route of the canal when the railway line was built in 1860 , the canal gradually fell into disrepair , and is shown as '' disused '' on 1882 ordnance survey maps , ordnance survey , 25 inch plans , cornwall and the isles of scilly , 1882 although the short southern section to sandplace continued in use for several years priestley , published in 1831 , described the canal : the liskeard and looe canal commences at tarras pill , and proceeds from thence in a northerly direction to the parish of liskeard terminating at moorswater , ] above the level of the sea there was a wharf at sandplace ( sand place ) but it was immediately adjacent to the main line of the canal ; messenger points out that a quay was dug into the river bank at sandplace to serve a kiln , and priestley was misled into thinking that this was a branch of the canal ; actually it was the main river the vertical interval he quotes may be due to the definition of '' sea level '' at the time ; in any case the lower end of the canal joined the river some distance above the sea quoted in as late as the 1830s , pack horses and mules were the general means of transport for goods throughout the county , once off the turnpike roads at the time no canal inclined plane had been installed anywhere in the world : the first actually installed on a canal was on the ketley canal in 1788 the rise of 180 & nbsp ; feet in in 10 & nbsp ; km ) threatened water supply difficulties if negotiated by locks , so green repeated the earlier proposal for two inclined planes the canal had been planned to run on the west side of the river towards looe , but a landowner , mr eliot , was holding out for excessive compensation for his land , and the construction was transferred to the east side over the affected length , in the lands of john buller , to by-pass eliot 's land it rose through over its length of although the canal was in full operation , there were numerous challenges facing the proprietors traffic immediately transferred to this road from the steep and inconvenient turnpike road ( '' old road '' ) and the canal company demanded a subscription for maintenance from the turnpike trustees this was due to a general agricultural depression , and also competition from st germans and lerryn ( on an arm of the river fowey ) ; the company repeatedly reduced dues on the canal moving the minerals by pack horse was expensive and inconvenient , and the liskeard and caradon railway was promoted to bring the ore to moorswater ; the canal company made room at their terminal for the railway there were also concerns about the adequacy of the water supply with the increased use of the locks , and there was considerable friction between the company and millers higher up the east looe valley over use of water at the later date , the canal was working at capacity , and the transshipment at moorswater from rail to canal was costing from 4d to 6d per ton ; because of congestion on the canal , trade was being lost to competing routes via calstock and st germans ; and the twenty-four locks caused the journey to be slow and cumbersome the railway did not take over the canal alignment : it crossed the canal by bridge in five places , three below sandplace and two above , although the railway seems to have obliterated the canal in the northern extremity sandplace continued to be a significant wharf for the canal , due to the activities of john buller , but it appears that the canal above that point , although not actually displaced by the railway construction , was positively allowed to decline although the canal was still officially open , the liskeard water company negotiated the takeover of the crylla leat and its water supply from may 1861 , subsequently agreeing to pay £5 per year for its perpetual use the canal was still maintained , as £179 was spent on repairs between 1862 and 1867 , but it is fairly certain that this only affected the lower section the upper section may have been used by the tenants of the morval estate for the transport of agricultural produce , for which no tolls were chargeable , but residents at duloe complained in 1867 that the canal could no longer be used since the railway had been built a note in the accounts for 1862 states : '' 1861 : lluc 's canal replaced by railway and steam introduced on the lcr the great western railway purchased the canal company in 1909 , in order to acquire the railway line , passenger traffic , and especially tourism , having taken over as the dominant traffic in 1988 the west country branch of the inland waterways association produced a walking guide to the canal , and to several others in the west country , hoping to stimulate interest in it
