electrophysiology is the branch of physiology that pertains broadly to the flow of ions ( ion current ) in biological tissues and , in particular , to the electrical recording techniques that enable the measurement of this flow such a configuration allows direct observation and recording of the intracellular electrical activity of a single cell however , this invasive setup reduces the life of the cell and causes a leak of substances across the cell membrane intracellular activity may also be observed using a specially formed ( hollow ) glass pipette containing an electrolyte if the tip is small enough , such a configuration may allow indirect observation and recording of action potentials from a single cell , termed single-unit recording depending on the preparation and precise placement , an extracellular configuration may pick up the activity of several nearby cells simultaneously , termed multielectrode array larger electrodes are sensitive only to the net activity of many cells , termed local field potentials still larger electrodes , such as uninsulated needles and surface electrodes used by clinical and surgical neurophysiologists , are sensitive only to certain types of synchronous activity within populations of cells numbering in the millions classical techniques allow observation of electrical activity at approximately a single point within a volume of tissue after introducing one or more such compounds into tissue via perfusion , injection or gene expression , the 1 or 2-dimensional distribution of electrical activity may be observed and recorded to make an intracellular recording , the tip of a fine ( sharp ) microelectrode must be inserted inside the cell , so that the membrane potential can be measured their experiments involved intracellular recordings from the giant axon of atlantic squid ( loligo pealei ) , and were among the first applications of the '' voltage clamp '' technique movie featuring alan hodgkin recording action potentials from a squid axon today , most microelectrodes used for intracellular recording are glass micropipettes , with a tip diameter of conventional intracellular recording involves impaling a cell with a fine electrode ; patch-clamp recording takes a different approach this configuration is the '' cell-attached '' mode , and it can be used for studying the activity of the ion channels that are present in the patch of membrane a disadvantage ( compared to conventional intracellular recording with sharp electrodes ) is that the intracellular fluid of the cell mixes with the solution inside the recording electrode , and so some important components of the intracellular fluid can be diluted in situations where one wants to record the potential inside the cell membrane with minimal effect on the ionic constitution of the intracellular fluid a sharp electrode can be used available online at often the tip of the electrode is filled with various kinds of dyes like lucifer yellow to fill the cells recorded from , for later confirmation of their morphology under a microscope an electrode introduced into the brain of a living animal will detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip this type of recording is often called '' multi-unit recording '' , and is often used in conscious animals to record changes in the activity in a discrete brain area during normal activity this process is called spike sorting and is suitable in areas where there are identified types of cells with well defined spike characteristics if the electrode tip is bigger still , in general the activity of individual neurons can not be distinguished but the electrode will still be able to record a field potential generated by the activity of many cells at the right , the lower trace shows a negative wave that corresponds to a current sink caused by positive charges entering cells through postsynaptic glutamate receptors , while the upper trace shows a positive wave that is generated by the current that leaves the cell ( at the cell body ) to complete the circuit oxidation and reduction is accomplished by changing the voltage at the active surface of the recording electrode in a process known as '' scanning '' it is important to note that mechanical perturbations , which usually destroy a biological lipid membrane , do not influence the life-time of an ssm this property allows the application of rapid substrate/ligand concentration jumps to investigate the electrogenic activity of the protein of interest , measured via capacitive coupling between the vesicles and the electrode the bioelectric recognition assay ( bera ) is a novel method for determination of various chemical and biological molecules by measuring changes in the membrane potential of cells immobilized in a gel matrix in this way , when a positive sample is added to the sensor , a characteristic , '' signature-like '' change in electrical potential occurs ( 2012 ) superoxide determination using membrane-engineered cells : an example of a novel concept for the construction of cell sensors with customized target recognition properties a recent advance is the development of a technique called molecular identification through membrane engineering ( mime ) this technique allows for building cells with defined specificity for virtually any molecule of interest , by embedding thousands of artificial receptors into the cell membrane for example , a doctor may insert a catheter containing an electrode into the heart to record the heart muscle 's electrical activity
