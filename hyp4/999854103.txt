in a vehicle , shock absorbers reduce the effect of traveling over rough ground , leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling one of the features of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping , and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension , the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was '' impossible '' to use them as main springs these friction disk shock absorbers were also fitted to many cars realising that the spring and vehicle combination bounced with a characteristic frequency , these auxiliary springs were designed with a different period , but were not a solution to the problem that the spring rebound after striking a bump could throw you out of your seat it does not seem to have gone into production right away , whereas mechanical dampers such as the gabriel snubber started being fitted in the late 1900s ( also the similar stromberg anti-shox ) this contained a spring inside the telescopic unit like the pure spring type 'shock absorbers ' mentioned above , but also oil and an internal valve so that the oil damped in the rebound direction when the piston is forced up or down by bumps in the road , hydraulic fluid moves between different chambers via small holes or '' orifices '' in the piston and via the valve , converting the '' shock '' energy into heat which must then be dissipated in a psd shock absorber , which still consists of two nested tubes and still contains nitrogen gas , a set of grooves has been added to the pressure tube control '' tradeoff , it also reduced pitch during vehicle braking and roll during turns coilover shock absorbers are usually a kind of twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring as its name implies , the mono-tube shock , which is also a gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format , consists of only one tube , the pressure tube , though it has two pistons these pistons are called the working piston and the dividing or floating piston , and they move in relative synchrony inside the pressure tube in response to changes in road smoothness the two pistons also completely separate the shock 's fluid and gas components the mono-tube shock absorber is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes , making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for twin-tube shocks it also does not have a compression valve , whose role has been taken up by the dividing piston , and although it contains nitrogen gas , the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure ( 260-360 p.s.i one advantage of this type is , by using special internal valving , the absorber may be made relatively soft to compression ( allowing a soft response to a bump ) and relatively stiff to extension , controlling '' rebound '' , which is the vehicle response to energy stored in the springs ; similarly , a series of valves controlled by springs can change the degree of stiffness according to the velocity of the impact or rebound specialized shock absorbers for racing purposes may allow the front end of a dragster to rise with minimal resistance under acceleration , then strongly resist letting it settle , thereby maintaining a desirable rearward weight distribution for enhanced traction : compression of a gas , for example pneumatic shock absorbers , which can act like springs as the air pressure is building to resist the force on it in very heavy duty units used for racing or off-road use , there may even be a secondary cylinder connected to the shock absorber to act as a reservoir for the oil and pressurized gas conventional shock absorbers can be combined with air suspension springs - an alternate way to achieve ride-height control , and self leveling suspension the effect of a shock absorber at high ( sound ) frequencies is usually limited by using a compressible gas as the working fluid or mounting it with rubber bushings additional control can be provided by dynamic valve control via computer in response to sensors , giving both a smooth ride and a firm suspension when needed , allowing height adjustable suspension unlike the shock absorber , the strut has a reinforced body and stem ; strut already plays the role of shocks absorbers , so the shock absorber may well act as part of the strut , not the other way around struts is subjected to multidirectional loads , while the shock absorber only damps vibrations and receive an impact along its axis ; the strut gives to the car greater reliability ; strut and shock absorber have a different way of attachment
