dosages are titrated to target blood levels at specific times after medication administration although almost exclusively used in trial cases only , tacrolimus has shown to be significantly effective in the suppression of flares of uc it suppresses inflammation in a similar way to steroids , and is equally as effective as a mid-potency steroid an important advantage of tacrolimus is that , unlike steroids , it does not cause skin thinning ( atrophy ) , or other steroid related side effects in addition , it may potentially increase the severity of existing fungal or infectious conditions such as herpes zoster or polyoma viral infections the risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of treatment the most common adverse events associated with the use of topical tacrolimus ointments , especially if used over a wide area , include a burning or itching sensation on the initial applications , with increased sensitivity to sunlight and heat on the affected areas tacrolimus is primarily metabolised by the cytochrome p450 system of liver enzymes , and there are many substances that interact with this system and induce or inhibit the system 's metabolic activity as infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the post-transplant patient , the most commonly reported interactions include interactions with anti-microbial drugs although this activity is similar to that of cyclosporin , the incidence of acute rejection is reduced by tacrolimus use over cyclosporin use although short-term immunosuppression concerning patient and graft survival is found to be similar between the two drugs , tacrolimus results in a more favorable lipid profile , and this may have important long-term implications given the prognostic influence of rejection on graft survival genetic variations within cyp3a5 that result in changes to the activity of the cyp3a5 protein can affect concentrations of tacrolimus within the body across a large number of studies , individuals homozygous for the g allele have been shown to have higher concentrations of tacrolimus and require lower doses of the drug , as compared to individuals who are not homozygous for the g allele achieving target concentrations of tacrolimus is important â€“ if levels are too low , then there is a risk of transplant rejection , if levels are too high , there is a risk of drug toxicities there is evidence to suggest that dosing patients based on rs776746 genotype can result in faster and more frequent achievement of target tacrolimus levels however , there is a lack of consistent evidence as to whether dosing based on rs776746 genotype results in improved clinical outcomes ( such as a decreased risk for transplant rejection or drug toxicities ) , likely because patients taking tacrolimus are subject to therapeutic drug monitoring fkbb enzyme is responsible of allylmalonyl-coa synthesis or possibly propionylmalonyl-coa at c21 , which it is an unusual step of general pks 1 particularly fkbm enzyme is responsible of alcohol methylation targeting the alcohol of dhchc starter unit ( carbon number 31 depicted in brown ) , and fkbd enzyme is responsible of c9 ( depicted in green )
