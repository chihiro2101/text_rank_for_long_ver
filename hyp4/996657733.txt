patients with macropsia have also noted the cessation of auditory function prior to the onset of visual hallucination , indicating possible seizure either before or after the hallucination some patients claim that symptoms may be eased if an attempt is made to physically touch the object which appears enormous in size am j psychiatry 121:1123-1124 , may 1965 it is important to note , however , that patients typically remain lucid and alert throughout episodes , being able to recount specific details those who acquire macropsia as a symptom of a virus usually experience complete recovery and restoration of normal vision dysmetropsia in one eye , a case of aniseikonia , can present with symptoms such as headaches , asthenopia , reading difficulties , depth perception problems , or double vision there are a broad range of psychological and emotional effects that a person suffering macropsia may experience one competing theory has radically stated that macropsia may be an entirely psychological pathological phenomenon without any structural defect or definite cause there may be no evidence of psychiatric disturbance and , as a result , no psychiatric therapy may be required those afflicted may experience extreme anxiety both during and after episodes as a result of the overwhelming nature of his or her distorted visual field the psychological impact of macropsia on long time sufferers who have had the condition since childhood may be greater and lead to severe ego-deficiencies an alternative interpretation of the condition is that macropsia is a response to biophysiological contraction and has no psychological roots in cases where macropsia affects one eye resulting in differences in the way the two eyes perceive the size or shape of images , the condition is known as aniseikonia aniseikonia is known to be associated with certain retinal conditions retinoschisis is another eye disease that has been shown to cause aniseikonia the intensity of the macropsia episodes decreased with the decreasing amount of zolpidem administered ; it is implied in the article that the level of intensity was based on the patients accounts of her macropsia episodes , and that no external diagnosis was used citalopram-induced macropsia is similar to zolpidem-induced macropsia since both types have been observed in relatively few cases , and neither of the drugs â€™ side effects can be supported by experimental evidence one of these studies was conducted on japanese adolescents who reported visual episodic illusions with macropsia and showed that illusions are three times more likely to occur in association with migraine it is also unlikely for macropsia in adolescent children to be associated with a serious disease adolescents who are deemed to have multiple distortions per episode , such as slow motion vision and macropsia , are even more likely to be sufferers of migraine a person with macropsia may fail to see the connection between the migraine and the macropsia , since the conditions may not elicit symptoms at the same time pediatrics 1979 ; 63 ; 517-519 the differences in visual phenomena , such as macropsia with slow motion versus macropsia without slow motion , may result from different areas of the brain being affected by migraine children who experience nocturnal hallucinations accompanied by macropsia may seek medical care for panic attack disorders and instead are diagnosed with forms of epilepsy endogenous hypoglycaemia can result in number of visual disturbances and sometimes macropsia this kind of hypoglycaemia is defined as having an abnormally low blood-sugar level due to anything other than the exogenous administration of insulin patients with both epstein-barr virus and infectious mononucleosis have cited an increase in the sizes of perceived objects , coinciding with other symptoms of alice in wonderland syndrome 2002 jul ; 34 ( 4 ) : 348-52 macropsia may appear either before the onset , or after the resolution , of all clinical symptoms associated with the illness almost all patients with macropsia due to infectious mononucleiosis make full recoveries in the case of macropsia , the greater density of photoreceptor cells leads to greater stimulation making the object seem larger in some cases , the effects of macropsia have been shown to be field dependent , in that the degree of visual distortion is related to the visual field angle macropsia is generally diagnosed once a patient complains of the characteristic symptoms , such as disproportionally large objects in their visual field the most common way to treat forms of aniseikonia , including macropsia , is through the use of auxiliary optics to correct for the magnification properties of the eyes patients have reported significantly improved visual comfort associated with a correction of 5-10 % of the aniseikonia with regard to drug-induced or virus-induced macropsia , once the underlying problem , either drug abuse or viral infection , is treated , the induced macropsia ceases future research may focus on ways to limit the occurrence of retinally-induced macropsia due to surgery in terms of treatment , the most effective optical correction is still being researched with respect to visual field angles and direction to a target
