excavations in south crete in 2008–2009 revealed stone tools at least 130,000 years old this was a sensational discovery , as the previously accepted earliest sea crossing in the mediterranean was thought to occur around 12,000 bc humans played a part in this extinction , which occurred on other medium to large mediterranean islands as well ; , for example , on cyprus , sicily and majorca because of a lack of written records , estimates of the minoan chronology are based on well-established minoan pottery styles , which can at points be tied to egyptian and ancient near eastern chronologies by finds away from crete and clear influences by the 16th century bc pottery and other remains on the greek mainland show that the minoans had far-reaching contacts on the mainland in the late 4th century bc , the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite , and crete 's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states while the cities continued to prey upon one another , they invited into their feuds mainland powers like macedon and its rivals rhodes and ptolemaic egypt as a result , the macedonian king philip v gained hegemony over crete which lasted to the end of the cretan war ( 205–200 bc ) , when the rhodes opposed the rise of macedon and the romans started to interfere in cretan affairs ) crete continued to be part of the eastern roman or byzantine empire , a quiet cultural backwater , until it fell into the hands of iberian muslims under abu hafs in the 820s , who established a emirate of crete on the island candia ( chandax , modern heraklion ) , a city built by the iberian muslims , was made capital of the island instead despite frequent revolts by the native population , the venetians retained the island until 1669 , when the ottoman empire took possession of it sanders , an archaeological survey and gazetteer of late hellenistic , roman and early byzantine crete , 1982 ) annette bingham , ''

known as the revolt of st thumb during the cretan war ( 1645–1669 ) , venice was pushed out of crete by the ottoman empire , with most of the island lost after the siege of candia ( 1648–1669 ) , possibly the longest siege in history the last venetian outpost on the island , spinalonga , fell in 1718 , and crete was a part of the ottoman empire for the next two centuries contemporary estimates vary , but on the eve of the greek war of independence as much as 45 % of the population of the island may have been muslim the greek war of independence began in 1821 , with extensive cretan participation the muslims were driven into the large fortified towns on the north coast and it would appear that as many as 60 % of them died from plague or famine while there after greece achieved its independence , crete became an object of contention as the christians revolted several times against ottoman rule by early 1869 , the island was again under ottoman control when a small insurgency began in september 1895 , it spread quickly , and by the summer of 1896 the ottoman forces had lost military control of most of the island however , the great powers ( austria-hungary , france , the german empire , the kingdom of italy , the russian empire and great britain ) decided that the ottoman empire could no longer maintain control and intervened , dispatching a multinational naval force , the international squadron , to cretan waters in february 1897 soldiers from the armies of five of the powers ( germany refused to participate ) then occupied key cities in crete during late march and april 1897 after a violent riot by cretan turks on 6 september 1898 ( 25 august according to the julian calendar then in use on crete , which was 12 days behind the modern gregorian calendar during the 19th century ) , the admirals also decided to expel all ottoman troops from crete , which was accomplished on 6 november 1898 when prince george of greece arrived in crete on 21 december 1898 ( 9 december according to the julian calendar ) as the first high commissioner of the autonomous cretan state , crete effectively was detached from the ottoman empire , although it remained under the sultan 's suzerainty after the expulsion of ottoman forces in november 1898 , and the autonomous cretan state ( official greek name : κρητική πολιτεία ) , headed by prince george of greece and denmark , was founded under ottoman suzerainty in december 1898 one of the most important figures to emerge from the end of ottoman crete was the liberal politician eleftherios venizelos , probably the most important statesman of modern greece in 1910 venizelos transferred his career to athens , quickly became the dominant figure on the political scene and in 1912 , after careful preparations for a military alliance against the ottoman empire with serbia , montenegro , and bulgaria , allowed cretan deputies to take their place in the greek parliament british troops landed on crete with the consent of the greek government from 3 november 1940 , in order to make the 5th greek division of crete available for the albanian front the invasion of mainland greece by the axis powers began on 6

31 may 1941 ) , the island fell to the germans the first resistance groups formed in the cretan mountains as early as june 1941 an important school of icon painting , under the umbrella of post-byzantine art with latin influences , which flourished while crete was under venetian rule during the late middle ages , reaching its climax after the fall of constantinople , becoming the central force in greek painting during the 15th , 16th and 17th centuries as a result of plagues of the black death , many cretans migrated overseas during difficult periods on the island , some
