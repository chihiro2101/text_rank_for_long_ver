according to hasan raza , after more than six decades of its formal/ informal existence , a consensus on the definition of islamic economics has not yet emerged ( what most of the knowledge content in the body of islamic economics amounts to according to economist muhammad akram khan ) wiwwie2013 : p.xv an ideology '' a revolutionary ideology '' to change '' the corrupt reality '' ( social scientist olivier roy ) zaman ( 2015 ) argues that confusion regarding appropriate definition of islamic economics have arose because of attempts to mix western economics concepts with islamic ideals , when the two are diametrically opposed to each other in many dimensions he proposes a definition based on purely islamic sources : '' islamic economics is the effort/struggle to implement the orders of allah pertaining to economic affairs in our individual lives ( micro ) , in our communities ( meso ) , and at the level of ummah ( macro ) some brief works might contain almost nothing related to matters of property , sales , finance others do not gather questions on economic issues in one heading , the case in tawzih al-masa'il , a work of fatwa by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , who although a pioneer of political islam approached the subject of economy '' as the classical ulamas do ` '' ( source : ruhollah khomeini , tawzih al-masa'il , p.543 ) other works divided the subjects of fiqh into four '' quarters '' : islamic economics 4itofm2014 : p.8 typically worship ( al- ` ibadat ) , marriage and family law ( al-munakahat ) , criminal law ( jinayat ) , commercial transaction law ( muamalat ) a number of scholars ( olivier roy , timur kuran , omar norman ) have noted the recentness of reflecting on economic issues in the islamic world , and the difference between economics the social science based on data , and islamic jurisprudence based on revealed truth salman ahmed shaikh and monzer kahf insist on a clear distinction between the roles of fiqh and islamic economics , shaikh saying to be meritorious as a separate field of inquiry , islamic economics can not confine itself just to explaining and deducing laws in economic matters based on core principles kahf writes that mu'amalat and islamic economics '' often intermingle '' , islamic economics mkrdmie2003 : p.47 mu'amalat '' sets terms and conditions of conduct for economic and financial relationships in the islamic economy '' and provides the '' grounds on which new instruments '' of islamic financing are developed , but that the '' nature of fiqh imposes a concern about individual transactions and their minute legalistic characteristics '' , so that analyzing islamic economics in terms of fiqh '' risks losing '' the ability to provide a macro economic theory '' islamic economics mkrdmie2003 : p.49 according to economist muhammad akram khan the '' main plank '' of islamic economics is the '' theory of riba '' , while '' another landmark '' is zakat , a tax on wealth and income wiwwie2013 : p.xv-xvi according to another contemporary writer salah el-sheikh , '' islamic economic principles '' ( what he calls a '' fiqhiconomic model '' ) utilize the faqīh ( islamic jurisprudence ) as supporting material , but are grounded upon the ethical teachings within the qu'rān these tenets were '' among the first economic regulations '' and their philosophy can be seen today in modern capitalism islamic economics has been disparaged for its alleged '' incoherence , incompleteness , impracticality , and irrelevance '' , driven by '' cultural identity '' rather than problem solving ( timur kuran , john foster ) ; kuran , '' the economic impact of islamic fundamentalism , '' in marty and appleby fundamentalisms and the state , u of chicago press , 1993 , pp 89 in a political and regional context where islamist and ulema claim to have an opinion about everything , it is striking how little they have to say about this most central of human activities , beyond repetitious pieties about how their model is neither capitalism nor socialist being little more than a mimicry of conventional economics embellished with verses of the quran and sunnah ( muhammad ahram khan ) ; claiming to call for a return to islamic practices that are actually an '' invented tradition '' ( timur kuran ) ; failing to achieve its goals of abolishing interest on money , establishing economic equality , and a superior business ethic ; but nonetheless '' spared critical scrutiny out of ignorance , misguided tolerance '' , and because its methods and objectives are considered '' too unrealistic to threaten prevailing economic structures '' ( timur kuran ) ; islamic banking and finance one significant result of islamic economics ( and target of criticism ) is the creation of islamic banking and finance industry farooq ) argues that this unfortunate situation has arisen because the '' preoccupation '' among supporters of islamic economics that any and all interest on loans is riba and forbidden by islam , and because profit and loss sharing to interest bearing loans originally envisioned for islamic banking have not proven feasible '' mofrie2005 : p.33 as an example of the neglect of this issue , farooq complains that one '' rather comprehensive '' bibliography of islamic economics and finance , contains '' not a single citation for exploitation or injustice '' among its 700 entries mofrie2005 : p.31 a former director of pakistan institute of development economics and the head of pakistan 's economic affairs division , syed nawab haider naqvi , also called for '' comprehensive islamic reform to establish an exploitation-free economic system '' and not just '' mechanical substitution of profit for interest : the islamic foundation , 1981 , p.124 ; zakat on the issue of zakat , one of the pillars of islam , m.a.khan also criticizes the conservatism of islamic economics , complaining that '' the insistence of muslim scholars in implementing it in the same form in which it was in vogue in the days of the prophet and the first four caliphs '' wiwwie2013 : p.xvi ; practicality a supporter of islamic economics ( asad zaman ) describes a '' major difficulty '' faced by islamic reformers of islamic economics and pointed out by other authors , namely that because a financial system is an '' integrated and coherent structure '' , to create an islamic system '' based on trust , community and no interest '' requires '' changes and interventions on several different fronts simultaneously '' islamic economics in pakistan islamic philosophy economy of the oic female labor force in the muslim world law and economics state capitalism corporatism dirigisme economics of fascism economy of malaysia economy of brunei economy of azerbaijan economy of kazakhstan economy of iran economy of jordan economy of saudi arabia islamic banking and finance economic history of the ottoman empire christian finance zakat ;
