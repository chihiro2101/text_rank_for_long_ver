the line had been planned to open at the same time as the grand junction railway which entered birmingham from the north on 9 april 1838 the company opened the north end of the line , between birmingham and rugby , and the south end from london to a temporary station at near bletchley with a stagecoach shuttle service linking the two parts to allow through journeys to london the line was officially fully opened on 17 september 1838 , with the first passenger train from london to birmingham arriving that day however , this was denied by peter lecount , one of the l & br engineers , who wrote in his 'history of the railway connecting london and birmingham ' ( 1839 ) , page 48 : '' it is not because locomotives can not draw a train of carriages up this incline that a fixed engine and endless rope are used , for they can and have done so , but because the company are restricted , by their act of parliament , from running locomotive engines nearer london than camden town the locomotive workshops were established in 1838 at wolverton , roughly halfway between the two termini at london and birmingham when the railway was fully opened , it had sixteen intermediate stations between london and birmingham the first branch from the main line was the aylesbury railway at aylesbury railway junction , of single track , which opened in 1839 and was leased to the l & br until purchased outright by the lnwr in 1846 from 1840 , when the midland counties railway made a junction to its line at rugby , the l & br also provided through connections from london to the east midlands and the north east the l & br purchased the trent valley railway in 1846 on behalf of the lnwr ; this line connected rugby on the l & br with stafford on the grand junction railway thus creating a more direct line from london to liverpool and manchester by avoiding the original route through birmingham in july 1846 the l & br merged with the grand junction railway and the manchester and birmingham railway to form the london and north western railway , which in turn was later absorbed into the london midland and scottish railway , before finally passing into the hands of the nationalised british railways in 1948 to become part of the west coast main line as it is known today curzon street station in birmingham closed to passenger traffic in 1854 ( the original entrance building remains ) when it was replaced by new street station and the original euston station in london was demolished in 1962 to make way for the present structure which opened in 1968 on the closure of curzon street as a passenger station , the site became the london and north western railway goods depot ( birmingham ) and became fully operational in 1865
