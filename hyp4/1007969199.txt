for example , in hornblower and the hotspur , he contrives an escape for his personal steward , who would otherwise have to be hanged for striking a superior officer in the happy return , the first novel published , hornblower 's age is given as 37 in july 1808 , implying a birth year of 1770 or 1771 however , when forester decided to write about hornblower 's early career in the sixth novel mr midshipman hornblower , he made his hero about five years younger , giving his birth date as 4 july 1776 ( the date of the adoption of the united states declaration of independence ) he is given a classics , and by the time he joins the royal navy at age seventeen , he is well-versed in greek and latin during his captivity , he acquires a fluent knowledge of both galician and spanish , which proves highly useful in several further adventures , and is finally confirmed as a commissioned lieutenant as a junior lieutenant , he serves in hms renown under captain sawyer , whose bouts of paranoia on a mission to the caribbean strain discipline to breaking point it is on this voyage that he begins his long friendship with william bush , at the time his senior in rank due to his exploits , hornblower is made commander , but his promotion is not confirmed when he returns to england following the announcement of the peace of amiens , causing him great financial distress : he has to make up the difference between a commander 's pay and a lieutenant 's , all from his half-pay while inactive despite this unfortunate beginning , however , he warms to her over the course of several books , and becomes a good ( though not perfect ) husband to her and father to their two children , also named horatio and maria once there , he meets the secretary of the admiralty and the rank is conferred when hornblower agrees to take part in a dangerous clandestine operation that eventually leads to the resounding british victory at trafalgar but just as this work is finished , the ship is given to the king of the two sicilies for diplomatic reasons , much to his disappointment later ( in the time line , but written of in the first novel ) , he makes a long , difficult voyage in command of the frigate hms lydia round the horn to the pacific , where his mission is to support a megalomaniac , el supremo , in his rebellion against the spanish when he finds that the spanish have switched sides in the interim , he is forced to find and sink the ship he had captured—adding injury to insult , as he had given up a fortune in prize money to maintain the uneasy alliance with the madman hornblower also takes on an important passenger in panama—lady barbara wellesley , the fictional younger sister of arthur wellesley ( later to become the duke of wellington ) —also hornblower 's future wife and the love of his life his feelings are disturbed during this period by the fact that his commander , admiral leighton , has recently married lady barbara , thereby apparently ending any hope that she and hornblower might act on their feelings for one another '' a national hero in the eyes of the public , and a useful propaganda tool for various politicians , not to mention the prince regent , he is made a knight of the order of the bath and appointed a colonel of marines ( a sinecure which confers a salary without any additional duties ) a return to duty comes when he is appointed to be commodore and sent with a squadron of small craft on a mission to the baltic sea , where he must be a diplomat as much as an officer his final , improbable achievement occurs at his home , when he assists a seemingly mad man claiming to be napoleon to travel to france that person turns out to be napoleon iii , the nephew of hornblower 's great nemesis and the future president ( and later emperor in his own right ) of france the first was in the first chapter of the happy return , which was the first hornblower novel written the second occurs midway through the commodore , when czar alexander asks him to describe his career the first account would have made hornblower about five years older than the second the second account is more nearly compatible with the rest of hornblower 's career , but it omits the time he spent as a commander in hornblower and the hotspur there are other discrepancies as well ; in one account of his defeat of a spanish frigate in the mediterranean , he distinguished himself as lieutenant and in another he is a post-captain with less than three years seniority in actuality the navy list reflecting the first promotions to rear admiral after napoleon 's death hathitrust , google-digitized navy list of december 1821 from the university of michigan library ( pages 4-6 ) shows captains holding that rank since 1797 still awaiting promotion to rear-admiral and as of the compilation of the royal naval biography wikisource : royal naval biography ( has captains listed by seniority ) a few years later those who '' made post '' in 1805 were still well down the queue ;
