the neural plate is the source of the majority of neurons and glial cells of the cns during this time , the walls of the neural tube contain neural stem cells , which drive brain growth as they divide many times gradually some of the cells stop dividing and differentiate into neurons and glial cells , which are the main cellular components of the cns the newly generated neurons migrate to different parts of the developing brain to self-organize into different brain structures synaptic communication between neurons leads to the establishment of functional neural circuits that mediate sensory and motor processing , and underlie behavior some landmarks of neural development include the birth and differentiation of neurons from stem cell precursors , the migration of immature neurons from their birthplaces in the embryo to their final positions , outgrowth of axons and dendrites from neurons , guidance of the motile growth cone through the embryo towards postsynaptic partners , the generation of synapses between these axons and their postsynaptic partners , and finally the lifelong changes in synapses , which are thought to underlie learning and memory activity-independent mechanisms are generally believed to occur as hardwired processes determined by genetic programs played out within individual neurons these processes are thought of as being independent of neural activity and sensory experience although synapse formation is an activity-independent event , modification of synapses and synapse elimination requires neural activity myelination , formation of the lipid myelin sheath around neuronal axons , is a process that is essential for normal brain function during early embryonic development of the vertebrate , the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to give rise to the epidermis and the nervous system ; a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neuroectoderm to form the neural plate which gives rise to the nervous system beginning in the future neck region , the neural folds of this groove close to create the neural tube neural induction is often studied in xenopus embryos since they have a simple body plan and there are good markers to distinguish between neural and non-neural tissue when embryonic ectodermal cells are cultured at low density in the absence of mesodermal cells they undergo neural differentiation ( express neural genes ) , suggesting that neural differentiation is the default fate of ectodermal cells in explant cultures ( which allow direct cell-cell interactions ) the same cells differentiate into epidermis ectoderm follows a default pathway to become neural tissue evidence for this comes from single , cultured cells of ectoderm , which go on to form neural tissue floor plate-derived shh subsequently signals to other cells in the neural tube , and is essential for proper specification of ventral neuron progenitor domains epigenetics play a key role in regulating gene expression in differentiating neural stem cells and are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain neuronal migration is the method by which neurons travel from their origin or birthplace to their final position in the brain neuronal precursor cells proliferate in the ventricular zone of the developing neocortex , where the principal neural stem cell is the radial glial cell the first mitosis cells must leave the stem cell niche and migrate outward to form the preplate , which is destined to become cajal-retzius cells and subplate neurons neurons migrating with this mode of locomotion are bipolar and attach the leading edge of the process to the pia radial glial cells , whose fibers serve as a scaffolding for migrating cells and a means of radial communication mediated by calcium dynamic activity , act as the main excitatory neuronal stem cell of the cerebral cortex or translocate to the cortical plate and differentiate either into astrocytes or neurons this is seen in multipolar cells , which in the human , are abundantly present in the cortical intermediate zone instead these multipolar cells express neuronal markers and extend multiple thin processes in various directions independently of the radial glial fibers neurons in culture develop synapses that are similar to those that form in vivo , suggesting that synaptogenic signals can function properly in vitro imaging experiments show that dendrites are highly dynamic during development and often initiate contact with axons induction of synapse formation by glial factors : barres and colleagues made the observation that factors in glial conditioned media induce synapse formation in retinal ganglion cell cultures synapse formation in the cns is correlated with astrocyte differentiation suggesting that astrocytes might provide a synaptogenic factor the processes of neuronal migration , differentiation and axon guidance are generally believed to be activity-independent mechanisms and rely on hard-wired genetic programs in the neurons themselves there are two distinct types of neural activity we observe in developing circuits -early spontaneous activity and sensory-evoked activity spontaneous activity occurs early during neural circuit development even when sensory input is absent and is observed in many systems such as the developing visual system , auditory system , motor system , hippocampus , cerebellum and neocortex in the developing auditory system , developing cochlea generate bursts of activity which spreads across the inner hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons which relay auditory information to the brain in the auditory system , spontaneous activity is thought to be involved in tonotopic map formation by segregating cochlear neuron axons tuned to high and low frequencies in the developing zebrafish spinal cord , early spontaneous activity is required for the formation of increasingly synchronous alternating bursts between ipsilateral and contralateral regions of the spinal cord and for the integration of new cells into the circuit it is hypothesized in that the growing structure copies the axonal development of the human brain : the earliest developing connections ( axonal fibers ) are common at most of the subjects , and the subsequently developing connections have larger and larger variance , because their variances are accumulated in the process of axonal development competition in vitro has been shown to involve a limited neurotrophic substance that is released , or that neural activity infers advantage to strong post-synaptic connections by giving resistance to a toxin also released upon nerve stimulation in vivo , it is suggested that muscle fibres select the strongest neuron through a retrograde signal neurogenesis also occurs in specific parts of the adult brain
