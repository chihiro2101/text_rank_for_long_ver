myoglobinuria may result from the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis , a condition in which muscle cells breakdown , sending their contents into the bloodstream this is attributed to the combination of increased blood flow and the ability of the body to find alternative sources of energy , like fatty acids and proteins in the long term , patients may exhibit kidney failure due to the myoglobinuria , and with age , patients may exhibit progressively increasing weakness and substantial muscle loss in a small number of cases compartment syndrome has developed , requiring prompt surgical referral in 2006 , another mutation ( c.13_14delct ) was discovered which may contribute to increased symptoms in addition to the common arg50stop mutation myophosphorylase is involved in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose for use in muscle findings consistent with mcardle 's disease would include a failure of lactate in venous blood and exaggerated ammonia levels these findings would indicate a severe muscle glycolytic block serum lactate may fail to rise in part because of increased uptake via the monocarboxylate transporter 1 , which is upregulated in skeletal muscle in mcardle disease physicians may also check resting levels of creatine kinase , which are moderately increased in 90 % of patients in some , the level is increased by multitudes - a person without gsd-v will have a ck between 60 and 400iu/l , while a person with the syndrome may have a level of 5,000 iu/l at rest , and may increase to 35,000 iu/l or more with muscle exertion this can help distinguish mcardle 's syndrome from carnitine palmitoyltransferase ii deficiency ( cpt-ii ) , a lipid-based metabolic disorder which prevents fatty acids from being transported into mitochondria for use as an energy source ) notably , this is the same phenomenon that occurs when muscle is poisoned by iodoacetate , a substance that blocks breakdown of glycogen into glucose and prevents the formation of lactate
