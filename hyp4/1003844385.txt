post-processualist daniel miller believed that the positivist approach of the processualists , in holding that only that which could be sensed , tested and predicted was valid , only sought to produce technical knowledge that facilitated the oppression of ordinary people by elites in a similar criticism , miller and chris tilley believed that by putting forward the concept that human societies were irresistibly shaped by external influences and pressures , archaeologists were tacitly accepting social injustice ian hodder stated that archaeologists had no right to interpret the prehistories of other ethnic or cultural groups , and that instead they should simply provide individuals from these groups with the ability to construct their own views of the past a number of post-processualists , such as michael shanks , christopher tilley and peter ucko , undermined '' archaeology 's claims to be an authoritative source of knowledge about the past '' , thereby '' encouraging people to question and resist all forms of authority… this position was hailed by its supporters as democratizing archaeology and purging it… of elitist pretensions '' while recognizing that past societies would have interpreted the world around them in a partially materialistic way , the post-processualists argue that many historic societies have also placed a great emphasis on ideology ( which included religion ) in both interpreting their world and influencing their behaviour examples of this can be seen in the work of bernard knapp , who examined how the social elite manipulated ideology to maintain their political and economic control , knapp , b using an example to explain this belief in materialist-idealist unity , the archaeologist matthew johnson looked at the idea of landscape among past societies he argued that : : on the one hand , a materialist view of landscape tends to stress how it may be seen in terms of a set of resources , for example for hunter-gatherers or early farming groups structuralism itself was a theory developed by the french anthropologist claude lévi-strauss ( 1908–2009 ) , and held to the idea that '' cultural patterns need not be caused by anything outside themselves… and that underlying every culture was a deep structure , or essence , governed by its own laws , that people were unaware of but which ensured regularities in the cultural productions that emanate from it post-processualists have also adopted beliefs regarding human agency , arguing that in other theoretical approaches to archaeology such as cultural-historical and processual , '' the individual is lost '' , and humans are therefore portrayed as '' passive dupes who blindly follow social rules a minority of post-processualists , such as julian thomas have however argued that human agency is not a useful aspect for looking at past societies , thereby accepting a cultural determinism position some had already anticipated the theory 's emergence , with the social anthropologist edmund leach informing the assembled archaeologists at a 1971 discussion on the topic of '' the explanation of culture change '' held at the university of sheffield that cultural structuralism , which was then popular among social anthropologists , would soon make its way into the archaeological community in effect , he came to believe that even using the processual approach to understanding archaeological data , there were still many different ways that that data could be interpreted , and that therefore radically different conclusions could be put forward by different archaeologists , despite processualism 's claim that using the scientific method it could gain objective fact from the archaeological record many american archaeologists had begun to recognise issues of bias within the scientific community , and within the processual movement itself which attempted to be scientific they also began to notice elements of ethnic prejudice within archaeology , particularly in regards to native american peoples , who had commonly not had a chance to participate in their own heritage management up until the 1990s many american archaeologists also began to take note of a gender bias in the archaeological interpretation and in the discipline as a whole , as women had been largely marginalised
