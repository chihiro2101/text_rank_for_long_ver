according to the constitution , the president was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces , represented in peace time by the minister of defence the treaty had been dictated by the victorious allies of world war i ; it forced germany to assume sole responsibility for the war , reduced the area of germany and imposed reparation payments and military restrictions on the nation the german government had repeatedly used freikorps troops to put down communist uprisings after the war some senior military commanders had started discussing the possibility of a coup as early as july 1919 during the civil war in 1919 , the brigade had seen action in munich and berlin general walther von lüttwitz , in command of all the regular troops in and around berlin ( gruppenkommando i ) , the highest ranking general in the army at the time and in command of many freikorps , said at the parade that he would '' not accept '' the loss of such an important unit several of lüttwitz ' officers were horrified at this open rejection of the government 's authority and tried to mediate , by setting up a meeting between lüttwitz and the leaders of the two major right-wing parties lüttwitz went to döberitz on 11 march and asked ehrhardt whether he would be able to occupy berlin that evening ehrhardt said he needed another day but in the morning of 13 march he could be in the centre of berlin with his men lüttwitz asked them to be ready to take over the government on 13 march one factor making them support quick action was that sympathetic members of the sicherheitspolizei in berlin informed them that warrants for their arrest had been issued that day to defend the government , noske ordered two regiments of sicherheitspolizei and one regular regiment to take position in the government quarter but doubted that a putsch was imminent two general officers met ehrhardt and convinced him to give the government a chance to surrender before being taken into custody , assuming that all of lüttwitz ' demands were accepted by 7:00 & nbsp ; am noske asked the commanders to defend the government buildings but was turned down all but two of the officers ( one of them was reinhardt , chef der heeresleitung ) refused to follow an order to shoot at the rebel troops some suggested negotiations , others claimed that the troops would not understand an order to fire , some argued that the regular units would not be able to defeat the elite marinebrigade at a confused meeting at the reichskanzlei , the undefended cabinet took two decisions : to flee the city and to issue a call for a general strike the government moved to dresden , where they hoped to get support from generalmajor maercker but he had been ordered by berlin to take them into '' protective custody '' and they moved on to stuttgart the cabinet proclamation on 13 march , calling on german workers to defeat the putsch by means of a general strike met with enormous success and received massive support from the working class left with the country paralyzed , kapp and lüttwitz were unable to govern ; in berlin , communication between military units was by courier only proclamations asking the workers to return to their jobs , promises of new elections and even the threat of capital punishment for strikers remained without results and the putsch collapsed on 17 march , four days after it had begun kapp had put vice-chancellor schiffer and the members of the prussian state government into protective custody on 13 march but they were released the next day and on 15 march , negotiations began the four big centre-right parties ( democratic party , zentrum , german people 's party and german national people 's party ) agreed that the main threat was now '' bolshevism '' and that they had to '' win back '' the officer corps the putschists offered only the resignation of kapp , and lüttwitz tried to hold on for another day as head of a military dictatorship but his commanders deserted him on 18 march , seeckt praised the discipline of the marinebrigade ehrhardt and the next day provided ehrhardt with a written promise that he would not be arrested as long as he was in command of the brigade and the brigade left berlin in the six days of crisis , it had retained the backing of the people of berlin and had effectively withstood a major threat from the extreme right as a consequence of the promise made to the putschists , the national assembly was dissolved in april and the date of the general election for the first republican reichstag was brought forward to 6 june so that the german people could express their feelings regarding the terms of the versailles treaty the spd had made a pact with the army , which resulted in communist workers being shot dead , so the left was permanently fractured ebert told the army it was free to arrange its own affairs , thereby forming a state-within-a-state implacably opposed to weimar that eventually was central to the right-wing coup against the prussian state government ( half of german territory ) in 1932 the violence came from local military commanders who supported the new government and arrested pickets , which the workers resisted the legitimate government returned to berlin on 20 march and asked for the general strike to be ended the government then tried to negotiate with workers who refused to lay down their arms , after the unions called off the strike on 22 march
