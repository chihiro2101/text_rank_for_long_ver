research is underway to try to change this , such that even salmon and other carnivores could be successfully fed with vegetable products '' not only do the feeds for carnivorous fish , like certain salmon species , remain controversial due to the containment of wild caught fish like anchovies , but they are not helping the health of the fish , as is the case in norway in choosing a clinical nutrition approach using functional feeds could , potentially move away from chemotherapeutic and antibiotic treatments , which could lower the costs of disease treatment and management in fish farms however , fish tend also to be animals that aggregate into large schools at high density large numbers of highly populated , open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice ; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms , many young wild salmon are infected , and do not survive as a result adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice , but small , thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable a 2008 meta-analysis of available data shows that salmon farming reduces the survival of associated wild salmon populations this claim , however , has been criticized by numerous scientists who question the correlation between increased fish farming and increases in sea lice infestation among wild salmon because of parasite problems , some aquaculture operators frequently use strong antibiotic drugs to keep the fish alive , but many fish still die prematurely at rates up to 30 % ciwf trust report , '' in too deep – the welfare of intensively farmed fish '' ( 2002 ) additionally , other common drugs used in salmonid fish farms in north america and europe include anesthetic , chemotherapeutic , and anthelmintic agents however , most fish-farming operations still use antibiotics , many of which escape into the surrounding environment the high concentrations of fish produce a significant amount of condensed faeces , often contaminated with drugs , which again affects local waterways aquaculture not only impact the fish on the farm , but it also involves environmental interactions with other species , which in return are attracted or repelled by the farms not only does this help with the pollution problem , but water with a stronger current also aids in overall fish growth concern remains that resultant bacterial growth strips the water of oxygen , reducing or killing off the local marine life in regards to genetically modified , farmed salmon , concern has been raised over their proven reproductive advantage and how it could potentially decimate local fish populations , if released into the wild however , the fda , has determined that while net pens would not be the most appropriate to prevent escapes , that raising the salmon in panama waters would result effective in the prevention of escape because the water conditions there would fail to support long-term survival of the salmon in the case that they escaped another method of preventing aqua advantage fish from impacting the ecosystems in the case they escape suggested by the fda was to create sterile triploid females in 2008 , the us national organic standards board allowed farmed fish to be labeled as organic provided less than 25 % of their feed came from wild fish in the european union , fish labeling as to species , method of production and origin , has been required since 2002 through this system , many of the environmental drawbacks of aquaculture are minimized including escaped fish , water usage , and the introduction of pollutants håstein of the national veterinary institute , '' different methods for slaughter of fish are in place and it is no doubt that many of them may be considered as appalling from an animal welfare point of view '' following are some of the less humane ways of killing fish co₂ narcosis exsanguination without stunning is a process in which fish are taken up from water , held still , and cut so as to cause bleeding electric stunning can be humane when a proper current is made to flow through the fish brain for a sufficient period of time
