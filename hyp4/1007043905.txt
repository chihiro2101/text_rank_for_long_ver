moreover , the distinction between living round spermatids , to be used in rosi , and dead round spermatids , to be discarded , needs specific methods and skills , not required in the case of icsi where sperm cell viability can be easily evaluated on the basis of sperm motility in most cases if all requirements for round spermatid selection and injection are successfully met , the injected oocytes develop to early embryos and can be transferred to the mother 's uterus to produce pregnancy this procedure is most commonly used to overcome male infertility problems , although it may also be used where eggs can not easily be penetrated by sperm , and occasionally in addition to sperm donation even with severe teratozoospermia , microscopy can still detect the few sperm cells that have a '' normal '' morphology , allowing for optimal success rate apart from the most common techniques of in vitro sperm capacitation ( swim-up , density gradients , filtration and simple wash ) , some new techniques are incredible useful and better than the previous ones the advantages in relation with other techniques revolve around sperm quality , as the selected ones have better motility , morphology , little dna fragmentation and less quantity of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) however , it should not be used in cases of severe oligozoospermia , since it may be difficult to recover the spermatozoa for performing icsi icsi ’ s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female , to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium , on which icsi ’ s success depends icsi is generally performed following a transvaginal oocyte retrieval procedure to extract one or several oocytes from a woman after the procedure , the oocyte will be placed into cell culture and checked on the following day for signs of fertilization concern has been raised that in icsi this sperm selection process is bypassed and the sperm is selected by the embryologist without any specific testing basic research on the maturation of sperm shows that hyaluronan-binding sperm are more mature and show fewer dna strand breaks and significantly lower levels of aneuploidy than the sperm population from which they were selected a recent clinical trial showed a sharp reduction in miscarriage with embryos derived from picsi sperm selection '' human reproduction 28 ( 2 ) :306-14 ( 2013 ) 'washed ' or 'unwashed ' sperm may be used in the process , presentation '' new styles of icsi '' during eshre-workshop may 18 , 2019 gent/belgium '' top quality in micromanipulation : everything you always wanted to know about icsi and embryo biopsy '' the procedure includes specialized piezo actuators , microcapillaries , and filling medium to transfer mechanical pulses to the cell membranes pgd is a process in which one or two cells from an embryo on day 3 or day 5 are extracted and the cells genetically analyzed one of the areas in which sperm injection can be useful is vasectomy reversal however , potential factors that may influence pregnancy rates ( and live birth rates ) in icsi include level of dna fragmentation as measured e.g a systematic meta-analysis of 24 estimates of dna damage based on a variety of techniques concluded that sperm dna damage negatively affects clinical pregnancy following icsi in a summary position paper , the practice committee of the american society of reproductive medicine has said it considers icsi safe and effective therapy for male factor infertility , but may carry an increased risk for the transmission of selected genetic abnormalities to offspring , either through the procedure itself or through the increased inherent risk of such abnormalities in parents undergoing the procedure there is not enough evidence to say that icsi procedures are safe in females with hepatitis b in regard to vertical transmission to the offspring , since the puncture of the oocyte can potentially avail for vertical transmission to the offspring
