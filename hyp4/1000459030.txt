although the blood vessels of the eye also obstruct light , they are invisible under normal circumstances because they are fixed in location relative to the retina , and the brain '' tunes out '' stabilized images through neural adaptation the brightness of the daytime sky also causes the eyes ' pupils to contract , reducing the aperture , which makes floaters less blurry and easier to see floaters can occur when eyes age ; in rare cases , floaters may be a sign of retinal detachment or a retinal tear during this detachment , the shrinking vitreous can phosphene , causing the patient to see random flashes across the visual field , sometimes referred to as '' flashers '' , a symptom more formally referred to as photopsia this will often leak blood into the vitreous , which is seen by the patient as a sudden appearance of numerous small dots , moving across the whole field of vision consequently , both the appearance of flashes and the sudden onset of numerous small floaters should be rapidly investigated by an eye care provider patients with retinal tears may experience floaters if red blood cells are released from leaky blood vessels , and those with uveitis or vitritis , as in toxoplasmosis , may experience multiple floaters and decreased vision due to the accumulation of white blood cells in the vitreous humour however , if the floater is near the retina , it may not be visible to the observer even if it appears large to the patient increasing background illumination or using a pinhole to effectively decrease pupil diameter may allow a person to obtain a better view of his or her own floaters floaters are often caused by the normal aging process and will usually become less bothersome as a person learns to ignore them looking up/down and left/right will cause the floaters to leave the direct field of vision as the vitreous humour swirls around due to the sudden movement if floaters significantly increase in numbers and/or severely affect vision , then one of the below treatments may be necessary no strong evidence currently exists for the treatment of floaters with laser vitreolysis as a result , they often provide a limited view of the vitreous , which can make it difficult to identify the targeted floaters and membranes they also carry a high risk of damage to surrounding ocular tissue the use of a laser also poses significant risks to the vision in what is otherwise a healthy eye additionally , eyes with an inflammatory disease after direct trauma to the globe or have recently undergone eye surgery have an increased chance of developing a vitreous floater
