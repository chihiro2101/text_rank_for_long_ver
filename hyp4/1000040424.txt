following this turn of events , janeway attempts to form an alliance with the kazon to secure safe passage through their area of space even though the kazon are not prominent beyond '' basics '' , they are referenced in subsequent seasons the kazon also appear in both '' relativity '' and '' shattered '' , which deal with time travel in both episodes , characters visit the point at which seska and the kazon were in control of voyager in the game , which is set in the 25th century , 30 years after the events of star trek : nemesis , the sect kazon-nistrim is classified as a rising power after a new leader took control away from culluh in star trek : voyager , the kazon are known under the collective title of the kazon order , but the species are also separated into various sections while the official star trek website lists the kazon as having eighteen sects , the episode '' initiations '' represents the number of sects as highly unstable and changing every day berman , piller , and taylor reasoned that the characters would be traveling through an area of space controlled by a new alien race , serving as the show 's primary antagonists , and created the kazon to fill this role 188 while discussing the kazon 's original inspiration , taylor viewed them as a way '' to address the tenor of our times and what 190–191 taylor 's notes suggest that the show 's co-creators considered having the crips reach a truce with the main characters , which would anger another one of the gangs ( then titled the blood ) and lead to them being the primary antagonists 205 in the first draft of the script for '' caretaker '' , piller named the alien species the '' gazon '' and wrote the following description of them : during the summer of 1994 , gazon was changed to kazon , as it was feared that the name sounded too much like gaza according to the list of star trek technical manuals , the kazon were originally planned to be split into only two factions ( the '' kazon-sera '' and the '' kazon-ogla '' ) the kazon 's design was the subject of fan criticism following the series premiere , with one fan commenting : '' they look like they 're all having a bad hair day he said that he wanted the casting choices to convey the alien species as '' young , angry people who never lived old enough to have the kind of experience and perspective on the world that , say , the klingons and romulans might have '' the roles , however , were filled by actors outside this age range , with piller explaining that the decision was reached on the grounds that the '' older actors gave more polished performances '' he later regretted the choice of more mature actors , as he felt this conflicted with the writers ' concept of the species , making them appear too much like klingons in the first season , the kazon were introduced as one of three new alien species that could be used as recurring antagonists ; the other two were the vidiians and the sikarians 127 westmore found the kazon to be the most demanding species to design for voyager first season , though , overall , he found the make-up and prosthetic work for voyager easier than that required for star trek : deep space nine he explained this by comparing the relatively small number of kazon who appeared in episodes outside of the pilot to the numerous aliens featured throughout deep space nine voyager 's writing team devoted a larger amount of screen time in the show 's second season to develop kazon culture and society piller described the season as '' a deep investigation of the kazon that will turn them , i think , into perhaps one of the top five adversarial alien races in star trek 's history '' developed for one of his episodes— '' initiations '' —the notes were also used by taylor for the creation of '' alliances '' '' in response to fans ' concerns that voyager did not incorporate as many science fiction elements as previous star trek installments , he believed that the growing focus on the kazon would serve as the solution piller believed the alien species accentuated the show 's futuristic storylines , explaining : '' there are a lot of people who do n't consider a lot of the season 's episodes to be science fiction '' he followed this up by saying : '' but certainly you can make a case that facing the kazon in battle is futurist storytelling following the end of the second season , taylor decided to remove the kazon as the series ' primary antagonists , having found the effort to develop the alien species to be unsuccessful taylor argued that the kazon limited the potential of the series , saying : '' it created the curious implication that we are standing still in space , when our franchise is that we are going at incredible speeds toward the alpha quadrant – we keep running into the same people over and over again ! it was just an oddity , and i do n't think the kazon have served us well '' while discussing their role in the future episodes , she explained that it was her '' intention to leave them behind and to find new and i hope more interesting aliens '' believing that the large amount of space under the kazon 's control was implausible , he argued that the number of times voyager encountered the alien species would make their territory bigger than the united federation of planets and the klingon empire producer brannon braga supported the kazon 's removal , criticizing the species as '' half-baked klingons '' and their constant inclusion in episodes as making the series have '' the feeling that we 're traveling in a big circle '' piller said that it was suggested that the episodes could serve as an introduction to a new alien species , but he supported the possibility that they act as a farewell to the kazon storylines while acknowledging fans ' negative response to the alien species during star trek : voyager , dickens questioned if star trek : discovery would be an appropriate venue for the kazon to have a '' cameo comeback '' voyager 's cast members had a negative response to the continued inclusion of the kazon in the series and felt that their removal was the best course of action tim russ commented that the frequent incorporation of the species would strain the credibility of the storylines as the crew would have to eventually leave kazon-controlled space on their journey home 151–152 he also believed that the kazon were failures as antagonists , perceiving them to be insufficiently imposing for the main characters and fans to take them seriously robert picardo joked that the only interesting aspect of the species was their hairstyle , while robert beltran pointed to their lack of intelligence as the main factor preventing them from becoming strong villains '' mulgrew felt the crew 's mission to get home was a more compelling storyline than those related to the kazon , whom she criticized as '' great big stupid giants '' the kazon , along with seska , were placed at number two on a list by io9 's charlie jane anders profiling the 10 least threatening star trek villains even though evans described the kazon as starting from a good premise , he did not find them to live up to their label as '' the most powerful race in their area of the delta quadrant '' green questioned janeway 's resolve to never share voyager 's technology with the kazon , writing that the species was characterized as '' a spacefaring culture with warp drive '' so the crew would not be '' interfering with a primitive civilization '' 179–180 zach of bitch media placed the kazon as one example of star trek 's uneven treatment of race he felt that the series should have featured the formation of a new federation starting with these two alien species
