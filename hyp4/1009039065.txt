'' kandel 's initial interests lay in the area of history while at harvard , a place dominated by the work of b skinner , kandel became interested in learning and memory medical school and early research after becoming aware of kuffler 's work in 1955 , kandel graduated from medical school and learned from stanley crain how to make microelectrodes that could be used for intracellular recordings of crayfish giant axons when kandel joined the laboratory of neurophysiology at the us national institutes of health in 1957 , william beecher scoville and brenda milner had recently described the patient hm , who had lost the ability to form new memories after removal of his hippocampus kandel felt it would be productive to select a simple animal model that would facilitate electrophysiological analysis of the synaptic changes involved in learning and memory storage this decision was not without risk : many senior biologists and psychologists believed that nothing useful could be learned about human memory by studying invertebrate physiology in 1965 kandel published his initial results , including a form of presynaptic potentiation that seemed to correspond to a simple form of learning kandel took a position in the departments of physiology and psychiatry at the new york university medical school , eventually forming the division of neurobiology and behavior by 1971 tom carew had joined the research group and helped extend the work from studies restricted to short-term memory to experiments that included physiological processes required for long-term memory by 1981 , laboratory members including terry walters , tom abrams , and robert hawkins had been able to extend the aplysia system into the study of classical conditioning , a finding that helped close the apparent gap between the simple forms of learning often associated with invertebrates and more complex types of learning more often recognized in vertebrates starting in 1966 james schwartz collaborated with kandel on a biochemical analysis of changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage by this time it was known that long-term memory , unlike short-term memory , involved the synthesis of new proteins in 1983 kandel helped form the howard hughes medical institute at columbia devoted to molecular neural science . kandel 's original idea that learning mechanisms would be conserved between all animals has been confirmed . continuing work at columbia university since 1974 , kandel actively contributes to science as a member of the division of neurobiology and behavior at the department of psychiatry at columbia university kandel is also well known for the textbooks he has helped write , such as principles of neural science first published in 1981 and now in its fifth edition , principles of neural science is often used as a teaching and reference text in medical schools and undergraduate and graduate programs second , he wanted the jewish intellectual community to be brought back to vienna , with scholarships for jewish students and researchers kandel has since accepted an honorary citizenship of vienna and participates in the academic and cultural life of his native city , similar to carl djerassi kandel 's 2012 book , the age of insight—as expressed in its subtitle , the quest to understand the unconscious in art , mind , and brain , from vienna 1900 to the present —represents a wide-ranging historical attempt to place vienna at the root of cultural modernism
