although it is a distinct operation , tone mapping is often applied to hdri files by the same software package therefore , hdr image formats are often called scene-referred , in contrast to traditional digital images , which are device-referred or output-referred with the advent of color photography , tone mapping in the darkroom was no longer possible due to the specific timing needed during the developing process of color film also in 1991 , georges cornu√©jols introduced the hdr+ image principle by non-linear accumulation of images to increase the sensitivity of the camera : for low-light environments , several successive images are accumulated , thus increasing the signal to noise ratio modern hdr imaging uses a completely different approach , based on making a high-dynamic-range luminance or light map using only global image operations ( across the entire image ) , and then tone mapping the result the advent of consumer digital cameras produced a new demand for hdr imaging to improve the light response of digital camera sensors , which had a much smaller dynamic range than film mann 's method involved a two-step procedure : first , generate one floating point image array by global-only image operations ( operations that affect all pixels identically , without regard to their local neighborhoods ) another benefit of global-hdr imaging is that it provides access to the intermediate light or radiance map , which has been used for computer vision , and other image processing operations in feb 2001 , the dynamic ranger technique was demonstrated , using multiple photos with different exposure levels to accomplish high dynamic range similar to the naked eye a cloud blocking the sun ) can also interfere with the desired results , by producing one or more hdr layers that do have the luminosity expected by an automated hdr system , though one might still be able to produce a reasonable hdr image manually in software by rearranging the image layers to merge in order of their actual luminosity modern cmos image sensor can often capture a high dynamic range from a single exposure however , with proper processing , the information from a single exposure can be used to create an hdr image in security cameras the term used instead of hdr is '' wide dynamic range '' some of the sensors on modern phones and cameras may even combine the two images on-chip so that a wider dynamic range without in-pixel compression is directly available to the user for display or processing .
