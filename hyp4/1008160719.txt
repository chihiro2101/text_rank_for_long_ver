unlike consistency , independence is not a necessary requirement for a functioning axiomatic system — though it is usually sought after to minimize the number of axioms in the system an axiomatic system is called complete if for every statement , either itself or its negation is derivable from the system 's axioms ( equivalently , every statement is capable of being proven true or false ) lines and points are undefined terms ( also called primitive notions ) in absolute geometry , but assigned meanings in the theory of real numbers in a way that is consistent with both axiom systems a model for an axiomatic system is a well-defined set , which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system , in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system the property of categoriality ( categoricity ) ensures the completeness of a system , however the converse is not true : completeness does not ensure the categoriality ( categoricity ) of a system , since two models can differ in properties that can not be expressed by the semantics of the system as an example , observe the following axiomatic system , based on first-order logic with additional semantics of the following countably infinitely many axioms added ( these can be easily formalized as an axiom schema ) : : \exist x_1 : \exist x_2 : \lnot ( x_1 x_2 ) ( informally , there exist two different items ) stating definitions and propositions in a way such that each new term can be formally eliminated by the priorly introduced terms requires primitive notions ( axioms ) to avoid infinite regress the explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with the zermelo-fraenkel axioms , the result of the axiomatic method applied to set theory , allowed the '' proper '' formulation of set-theory problems and helped avoid the paradoxes of naive set theory once the axioms were clarified ( that inverse elements should be required , for example ) , the subject could proceed autonomously , without reference to the transformation group origins of those studies in recursion theory , a collection of axioms is called recursive if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is a theorem any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory , but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions , and even if it is , it is not likely to shed light on anything he chose the axioms , in the language of a single unary function symbol s ( short for '' successor '' ) , for the set of natural numbers to be : there is a natural number 0 axioms ) that relate a number of primitive terms — in order that a consistent body of propositions may be derived deductively from these statements
