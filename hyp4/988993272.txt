) , the poet ’ s work : 29 poets on the origins and practice of their art ( chicago and london : university of chicago press , 1979 ) from two of the most fundamental tools in the poet 's toolbox—meter and rhyme—without necessarily knowing a lot of terminology , as in this , the first stanza of byron 's '' the destruction of sennacherib '' : : the assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold , : and his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold ; : and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea , : when the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee byron 's use of meter and rhyme is especially evident and rewarding when one reads the lines out loud in other words , the physicality of the language—how it sounds and feels—accounts for a large measure of the poem 's effect critical terminology becomes useful when one attempts to account for why the language is pleasurable , and how byron achieved this effect a poem having a regular rhythm ( not all poems do ) is said to follow a certain meter in this case , the rhymes come right next to each other , which emphasizes them , and therefore emphasizes the sound , the physical nature , of the language the sound , the physical nature , of the language is also emphasized by alliteration , as in the repetition of s sounds in the third line : '' and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea '' this appearance , though , is deceptive : successful open form poems are informed throughout by organic structure which may resist formal description but is nonetheless a crucial element of the poem 's effect on the reading mind a poet writing in closed form follows a specific pattern , a specific design some designs have proven so durable and so suited to the english language that they survive for centuries and are renewed with each generation of poets ( sonnets , sestinas , limericks , and so forth ) , while others come into being for the expression of one poem and are then set aside ( frost 's '' stopping by woods on a snowy evening '' is a good example ) of all closed forms in english prosody , none has demonstrated greater durability and range of expression than blank verse , which is verse that follows a regular meter but does not rhyme : some few in that , but numbers err in this , : ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss ; : a fool might once himself alone expose , : now one in verse makes many more in prose the poet using this , the english sonnet or shakespearean sonnet form , may use the fourteen lines as single unit of thought ( as in '' the silken tent '' above ) , or treat the groups of four rhyming lines ( the quatrains ) as organizational units , as in shakespeare 's sonnet 73 : : that time of year thou mayst in me behold : when yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang : upon those boughs which shake against the cold : bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang ) any poem following this metrical pattern would generally be considered a limerick , however most also follow an aabba rhyme scheme most limericks are humorous , and many are ribald , or outright obscene ( possible rhymes that could follow an opening like '' there once was a man from nantucket '' are left as an exercise for the reader ) in contrast , a poet using free verse ( sometimes called '' open form '' ) seeks to find fresh and uniquely appropriate forms for each poem , letting the structure grow out of the poem 's subject matter or inspiration a common perception is that open form is easier and less rigorous than closed form ( frost likened it to '' playing tennis with the net down '' address at milton academy , massachusetts ( 17 may 1935 ) , but such is not necessarily the case ( skeptics should try playing tennis without a net ) : success with the open form requires great sensitivity to language and a particular type of adaptable understanding in the best open form poems , the poet achieves something that is inaccessible through closed form the metre of ‘ classical ’ poetry is replaced in open verse by cadence in rhythm , line indentation , with pauses implied by the syntax , thus the limiting factor of one human breath was naturally incorporated in the poetry , essential to an oral art form , composed to be read aloud in this poem , whitman uses synonyms and antonyms to give structural integrity to a poem comprising two yoked stanzas , much like ( but not exactly like ) the way poets working within closed forms use meter and rhyme to give structural integrity to their poems the surface is not necessarily the essence of the poem although in some cases ( notably , the works of william mcgonagall ) there is little beyond the immediate part of this involves recognising the voice of the poem ( who is speaking ) , and the rest of kipling 's just so stories : the events in the poem ; when these occur ; where is the 'speaker ' and where do the events occur ; why does the speaker speak ? william harmon has suggested that starting an analysis with : '' this poem dramatizes the conflict between the poem opens : : who sayes that fictions onely and false hair : become a verse ? is there in truth no beautie ? : is all good structure in a winding stair ? : may no lines passe , except they do their dutie : not to a true , but painted chair ? he was railing against the prevalent enthusiasm for pastoral poetry above all other forms ( as becomes apparent in subsequent verses ) allegorical verse uses an extended metaphor to provide the framework for the whole work it thus stands in contrast to poetry in other languages , such as french , where syllabic stress is not present or recognized and syllable count is paramount skillful poets structure their poems around a meter and line length , and then depart from it and play against it as needed in order to create effect , as robert browning does in the first line of '' my last duchess '' : : that 's my last duchess painted on the wall the opening spondees , which throw the iambic line out of pattern , gives the duke 's words a certain virulent energy : he 's spitting the words out gerard manley hopkins took this idea of poetric energy through departure from meter to its extreme , with his theory and practice of sprung rhythm , an approach to poetry in which the language constantly frustrates the reading mind 's expectation of a regular meter analyzing diction and connotation—the meanings of words as well as the feelings and associations they carry—is a good place to start for any poem the use of specific words in the poem serve to create a tone—an attitude taken towards the subject eliot quickly sets a certain tone , and then creates effect by juxtaposing it with a very different tone : : let us go then , you and i , : when the evening is spread out against the sky : like a patient etherized upon a table to analyze the poem , the reader must first reassemble these into meaningful units : a brief , evocative image— '' a leaf falls '' —appearing , like an unbidden thought , in the middle of a word , '' loneliness '' a single falling leaf is by itself a fine image for the feeling of loneliness , but in order to fully experience the poem , the reader must then put the elements of language back into the visual form in which cummings arranged them : a vertical line ( like a leaf falling to the ground ) , followed by a horizontal series of letters ( like a leaf laying flat on the ground ) the vertical line is dominated by the word '' one '' ( an absolutely appropriate expression of loneliness ) and by the letter '' l '' ( which , on the page , looks like the numeral 1 schools of poetry may be self-identified by the poets that form them ( such as imagism ) , or defined by critics who see unifying characteristics of a body of work by more than one poet ( for example the movement ) poetry analysis is almost as old as poetry itself , with distinguished practitioners going back to figures such as plato all poetry was originally oral , it was sung or chanted ; poetic form as we know it is an abstraction therefrom when writing replaced memory as a way of preserving poetic utterances , but the ghost of oral poetry never vanishes the characteristics of such poems include ( but are not limited to ) a strong narrative , regular poetic meter , simple content and simple form at the same time , many poems that read well aloud have none of the characteristics exhibited by t
