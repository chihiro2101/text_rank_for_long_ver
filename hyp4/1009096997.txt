these instruments can be found in the canadian forces administrative orders and defence administrative orders and directives ; they are used as direction for authorities within the cf to administer the day-to-day considerations of the forces in canadian practice , armed combat is a strictly regulated environment and legal officers are a crucial part of the planning that goes into operational decisions however , military chaplains are outside the criminal military jurisdiction like in germany , persons under military jurisdiction are under the usual civilian criminal law the military has a jurisdiction to investigate all military crimes proper , and also a number of other crimes that have been specifically listed as belonging to the military jurisdiction however , they are only under military jurisdiction if the crime has been committed against another military person or against the defence forces when the military has jurisdiction over an ordinary crime , and the crime carries fine as a punishment , a disciplinary punishment may be given instead of fine both in summary proceedings and in the courts of law when the company commander or his superior feels that the crime is non-trivial and requires professional investigation , they may submit the issue to the defence command for investigation the defence command has , in addition to the power of arrest , the power to use almost all other measures that are available to the finnish police during peacetime , professional soldiers ( with the exception of certain soldiers deployed to international missions ) can not be given other disciplinary punishment than a public letter of reprimand or a fine the military crimes that go to court are handled by civilian courts that have military members the court of appeals , that acts as the first instance for the prosecution of officers with at least major 's rank , will have a military member who has at least a major 's rank the supreme court of finland has two officers with at least colonel 's rank as members when handling military crimes when the military person holds a permanent or temporary paid position as a state military servant , as all officers and ncos in regular active service do , they will be sentenced to dismissal in addition to other punishments , if they are convicted of a military or a civilian crime for more than two years in prison and there are no special grounds for leniency if the military person is no longer in service , the summary disciplinary procedure can not be used and the military has no longer any law enforcement power over the issue in such cases , the former service member is investigated by the civilian police but the case is handled by a court with military members in addition to judicial dismissal , the defence forces and the border guard have the option of administratively ending the military person 's service if the person is in a paid position ) instead , they have a special service relationship to the state , thus necessitating differentiation between state military servants and crisis management personnel following this , the person may be declared permanently unfit for duty by the defence forces regional office for safety and security reasons as an exception to the principle that the military jurisdiction concerns only military persons , the penal code provides for the loss of military rank thus , not only active military persons but also retired personnel , reservists and persons who are too old to belong to reserve may lose their military ranks for crimes of civilian nature only some 250 military crimes in a year end up for handling in district courts members of any branch of the bundeswehr , the german armed forces , are subject to the ordinary civil jurisdiction and unless otherwise stated all civil laws apply to soldiers as well 96 ii to create military courts under special circumstances : in times of war , outside germany or on a german vessel , acting under a legal judge and only for members of the armed forces note that the wdo describes how to proceed on offenses that are not ( yet ) covered by the military penal code but clearly against a military regulation the head of the unit as immediate superior who acts as primary disciplinary master has the exclusive right to choose : non-judicial punishment ( such as fines , curfews , arrests up to 7 days ) , forwarding the decision to the next superior officer of the unit ( arrest then can be extended up to 21 days ) or calling the military service court ( truppendienstgericht ) which has the power for further punishment ( like degradation and shortening the salary up to five years ) the judge of such a court is a civil one , two military officers are attending every case and act as consultants to the judge he will remain in arrest for the same time but continue serving in his unit on duty times unless the court has imposed further limits there are certain para military forces in india too who have laws akin to the ones applicable to defence services the armed forces act 2006 replaces the three separate service discipline acts and earlier armed forces acts as the system of law under which the armed forces operate the armed forces act 2006 completed the harmonisation of service law , and took full effect on 1 november 2009 it deals with military offences , civil offences committed in some circumstances , offences by civilian subject to service discipline ( including family members ) , authority of commanding officer to deal with offences summarily , the court martial , the service civilian court , custody and appeals summary dealing by a commanding officer ( co ) is the central feature , this is acceptable within the echr because an accused always has the right to elect trial by the court martial the military judicial system is headed by the judge advocate general who is a civilian and part of the ministry of justice the ucmj is federal law , found in title 10 united states code chapter 47 , and implemented by the manual for courts-martial , an executive order issued by the president of the united states in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the united states armed forces it also includes ordinary crimes , but perhaps with different standards of proof and punishment than for civilians , on the grounds that more is expected of military personnel by their oaths of office
