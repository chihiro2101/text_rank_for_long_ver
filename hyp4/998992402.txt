in 1899 the greek scholar papadopoulos-kerameus produced a catalog of the library 's manuscripts and included a transcription of several lines of the partially visible underlying text heiberg was permitted by the greek orthodox church to take careful photographs of the palimpsest 's pages , and from these he produced transcriptions , published between 1910 and 1915 in a complete works of archimedes in addition , after disappearing from the greek orthodox patriarchate 's library , a forger added copies of medieval evangelical portraits in gold leaf onto four pages in the book in order to increase its sales value , further damaging the text reviel netz of stanford university and nigel wilson have produced a diplomatic transcription of the text , filling in gaps in heiberg 's account with these images sometime after 1938 , a forger placed four byzantine art religious images in the manuscript in an effort to increase its sales value the resulting light beam has characteristics that make it ideal for revealing the intricate architecture and utility of many kinds of matter—in this case , the previously hidden work of one of the founding fathers of all science '' in april 2007 , it was announced that a new text had been found in the palimpsest , which was a commentary on aristotle 's categories running to some 9 & nbsp ; 000 words '' this referred to the previous discovery of a text by hypereides , an athenian politician from the fourth century bc , which has also been found within the palimpsest in his other works , archimedes often proves the equality of two areas or volumes with eudoxus ' method of exhaustion , an ancient greek counterpart of the modern method of limits since the greeks were aware that some numbers were irrational , their notion of a real number was a quantity q approximated by two sequences , one providing an upper bound and the other a lower bound he viewed plane figures as made out of infinitely many lines as in the later method of indivisibles , and balanced each line , or slice , of one figure against a corresponding slice of the second figure on a lever he considered this method as a useful heuristic but always made sure to prove the results he found using exhaustion , since the method did not provide upper and lower bounds using this method , archimedes was able to solve several problems now treated by integral calculus , which was given its modern form in the seventeenth century by isaac newton and gottfried leibniz while he had a notion of linearity , to find the volume of a sphere he had to balance two figures at the same time ; he never figured out how to change variables or integrate by parts some pages of the method remained unused by the author of the palimpsest and thus they are still lost image : stomachion.jpg thumb ostomachion is a dissection puzzle in the archimedes palimpsest ( shown after suter from a different source ; this version must be stretched to twice the width to conform to the palimpsest ) in heiberg 's time , much attention was paid to archimedes ' brilliant use of indivisibles to solve problems about areas , volumes , and centers of gravity less attention was given to the stomachion , a problem treated in the palimpsest that appears to deal with a children 's puzzle reviel netz of stanford university has argued that archimedes discussed the number of ways to solve the puzzle , that is , to put the pieces back into their box no pieces have been identified as such ; the rules for placement , such as whether pieces are allowed to be turned over , are not known ; and there is doubt about the board the board illustrated here , as also by netz , is one proposed by heinrich suter in translating an unpointed arabic text in which twice and equals are easily confused ; suter makes at least a typographical error at the crucial point , equating the lengths of a side and diagonal , in which case the board can not be a rectangle modern combinatorics reveals that the number of ways to place the pieces of the suter board to reform their square , allowing them to be turned over , is 17,152 ; the number is considerably smaller – 64 – if pieces are not allowed to be turned over the codex board can be found as an extension of socrates ' argument in a seven-by-seven-square grid , suggesting an iterative construction of the side-diameter numbers that give rational approximations to the square root of two but it would certainly add to the mystery had archimedes used the suter board in preference to the codex board however , if netz is right , this may have been the most sophisticated work in the field of combinatorics in greek antiquity
