when the ancestors of today 's moss started to spread on land 470 & nbsp ; million years ago , they absorbed co 2 from the atmosphere and extracted minerals by secreting organic acids that dissolved the rocks they were growing on small organisms feeding on the nutrients created large areas without oxygen , which caused a mass extinction of marine species , while the levels of co 2 dropped all over the world , allowing the formation of ice caps on the poles some species adapted to disturbed , sunny areas are well adapted to urban conditions and are commonly found in cities individual plants or more long are common in sphagnum species for example wherever they occur , mosses require liquid water for at least part of the year to complete fertilisation it is generally believed that in the northern hemisphere , the north side of trees and rocks will generally have more luxuriant moss growth on average than other sides the reason is assumed to be because sunlight on the south side causes a dry environment each species of moss requires certain amounts of moisture and sunlight and thus will grow on certain sections of the same tree or rock moss releases the fixed nitrogen , along with other nutrients , into the soil '' upon disturbances like drying-rewetting and fire events , '' making it available throughout the ecosystem moss is also used in bonsai to cover the soil and enhance the impression of age however , specific species of moss can be extremely difficult to maintain away from their natural sites with their unique requirements of combinations of light , humidity , substrate chemistry , shelter from wind , etc moss spores fall in a constant rain on exposed surfaces ; those surfaces which are hospitable to a certain species of moss will typically be colonised by that moss within a few years of exposure to wind and rain woodland gardens in many parts of the world can include a carpet of natural mosses advantages of mosses over higher plants in green roofs include reduced weight loads , increased water absorption , no fertilizer requirements , and high drought tolerance since mosses do not have true roots , they require less planting medium than higher plants with extensive root systems with proper species selection for the local climate , mosses in green roofs require no irrigation once established and are low maintenance they grow more slowly than many aquarium plants , and are fairly hardy increasing number and resources available for competitive plants like grasses in containerized nursery operations , coarse mineral materials such as sand , gravel , and rock chips are used as a fast-draining top dressing in plant containers to discourage moss growth preindustrial societies made use of the mosses growing in their areas the plant underworld , sphagnum and water , australian botanic garden in world war i , sphagnum mosses were used as first-aid dressings on soldiers ' wounds , as these mosses said to absorb liquids three times faster than cotton , retain liquids better , better distribute liquids uniformly throughout themselves , and are cooler , softer , and be less irritating in rural uk , fontinalis antipyretica was traditionally used to extinguish fires as it could be found in substantial quantities in slow-moving rivers and the moss retained large volumes of water which helped extinguish the flames london installed several structures called '' city trees '' : moss-filled walls , each of which is claimed to have '' the air-cleaning capability of 275 regular trees '' by consuming nitrogen oxides and other types of air pollution and producing oxygen
