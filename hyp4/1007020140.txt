in the 1980s , the inclusion of women in the formerly male-only discipline ushered in the second època d'or ( golden age ) of castells ; the presence of women is credited with allowing castells to be built lighter and stronger , permitting the construction of previously undreamed-of 9- and 10-story castells the assembly is complete once all castellers have climbed into their designated places , and the enxaneta climbs into place at the top and raises one open hand aside from the people who climb to form the upper parts of the tower , others are needed to form the pinya , or bottom base of the castell , to sustain its weight members of the pinya ( most often men ) also act as a 'safety net ' if the tower structure collapses , cushioning the fall of people from the upper levels people forming higher levels of the tower move to a position from which they can easily get to their places in the tower this is done slowly and carefully , and as subsequent base levels are completed the castellers in the pinya determine if their base is solid enough for construction to continue the upper layers of the tower are built as quickly as possible in order to put minimal strain on the lower castellers , who bear most of the weight of the castell a 'rising ' castell consists of successive layers added from the bottom by lifting the castell into the air , stage by stage and is regarded as taking a great deal of practice , skill , and strength the sash is also believed to support the lower back , and it is used by other castellers in the team as a foothold or handhold when climbing up the tower performing castellers usually go barefoot as to minimise injuries upon each other as they climb to their positions and also for sensitivity when balancing and to have better feel and hold each other castells are primarily described by the number of people in each level of the tronc and the total number of levels and , where applicable , any special construction technique used levels are composed of between one and five individuals standing on the shoulders of the level below common terms indicating the number of people for each level of a tower : pilar ( '' pillar '' ) : one person per level torre ( '' tower '' ) : two people per level tres : three people per level quatre : four people per level cinc : five people per level ( and so on ) castells with more than four people per level are composite structures numbers of levels most commonly built : sis : six levels high set : seven levels vuit : eight levels nou : nine levels deu : ten levels for example , a tres de vuit ( abbreviated 3d8 ) denotes a tower with three people per level and eight levels ( in fact , only the first five levels will have three people per level ) very high towers and ones with a small number of people on each level normally need extra support from the base or bottom levels these base levels are frequently indicated as part of the name of the tower three kinds of base levels are most commonly used : pinya ( '' pine cone/bulk '' ) : the ground-level base , often composed of several hundred people a manille is often use for particularly tall castells ( nine or ten levels ) when tall castells are built , for extra challenge , without a folre and/or manilles that would usually be used due to their height , this is also mentioned , e.g with only a folre and no manilles ) the term amb l'agulla ( '' with the needle '' ) refers to a high column of one person per level which is built inside the main tower terms denoting special construction techniques include : aixecat per sota ( '' raised from below '' ) , in which the castell is built not from the bottom up by climbing , but from the top down with each successive level being boosted onto the shoulders of castellers who join at ground level ; caminant ( '' walking '' ) , in which a castell ( usually a pilar ) , and its pinya if any , slowly walk as a unit across the ground this is often done to enter the site at the beginning of an actuació pilar de sis : one person per level in a tower of six levels quatre de nou net : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v ujrmc0njdjg : four people at each level in a tower of nine levels without folre ( a second-level base ) built on top of the pinya ( ground level base ) cap de pinya ( '' base leader '' ) one of the team leaders 's assistants , who takes particular responsibility for the allocation of places in the pinya , ensuring even force is applied to the base of the castell
