international civil aviation organization - international standards and recommended practices - units of measurement to be used in air and ground operations - annex 5 to the convention on international civil aviation for historical reasons , other units such as miles per hour ( mph ) , knots ( kn ) measuring wind speed in knots '' the reason why sea winds are measured in knots at all has to do with maritime tradition '' or feet per second ( ft/s ) are also sometimes used to measure wind speeds historically , wind speeds have also been classified using the beaufort scale , which is based on visual observations of specifically defined wind effects at sea or on land there are also links to be found between wind speed and wind direction , notably with the pressure gradient and terrain conditions the fastest wind speed not related to tornadoes ever recorded was during the passage of tropical cyclone olivia on 10 april 1996 : an automatic weather station on barrow island , australia , registered a maximum wind gust of the wind gust was evaluated by the wmo evaluation panel who found that the anemometer was mechanically sound and the gust was within statistical probability and ratified the measurement in 2010 during the cyclone , several extreme gusts of greater than were recorded , with a maximum 5-minute mean speed of the extreme gust factor was in the order of 2.27–2.75 times the mean wind speed a method of estimating speed is to use doppler on wheels to sense the wind speeds remotely , and , using this method , the figure of during the 1999 bridge creek–moore tornado in oklahoma on 3 may 1999 is often quoted as the highest-recorded surface wind speed , although another figure of has also been quoted for the same tornado in a press release , the university announced that the methods used from measuring hd 189733b 's wind speeds could be used to measure wind speeds on earth-like exoplanets unlike traditional cup and vane anemometers , ultrasonic wind sensors have no moving parts and are therefore used to measure wind speed in applications that require maintenance-free performance , such as on the top of wind turbines instead of using time of flight measurement , acoustic resonance sensors use resonating acoustic waves within a small purpose-built cavity in order to perform their wind speed measurement kapartis , savvas ( 1999 ) '' anemometer employing standing wave normal to fluid flow and travelling wave normal to standing wave '' another tool used to measure wind velocity includes a gps combined with pitot tube in canada , reference wind pressures are used in design and are based on the '' mean hourly '' wind speed having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50
