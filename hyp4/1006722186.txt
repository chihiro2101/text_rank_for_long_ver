henry viii was proclaimed king of ireland by the crown of ireland act 1542 , an act of the irish parliament text of 1555 bull the link of '' personal union '' of the crown of ireland to the crown of england became enshrined in catholic canon law this placed the new kingdom of ireland in personal union with the kingdom of england in 1593 war broke out , as hugh o'neill , earl of tyrone , led a confederation of irish lords and spain against the crown , in what later became known as the nine years ' war a series of stunning irish victories brought english power in ireland to the point of collapse by the beginning of 1600 , but a renewed campaign under charles blount , lord mountjoy forced tyrone to submit in 1603 , completing the tudor conquest of ireland this period saw the rise of the loyalist irish catholic confederation within the kingdom and , from 1653 , the creation of the republican commonwealth of england , scotland and ireland parliament in this period came to be known as grattan 's parliament , after the principal irish leader of the period , henry grattan although ireland had legislative independence , executive administration remained under the control of the executive of the kingdom of great britain by the acts of union 1800 , voted for by both irish and british parliaments , the kingdom of ireland merged on 1 january 1801 with the kingdom of great britain to form the united kingdom of great britain and ireland the irish parliament ceased to exist , though the executive , presided over by the lord lieutenant , remained in place until 1922 unlike henry viii , this hierarchy was not excommunicated by the papacy , and still controlled what became the state church of the new kingdom in 1542 , and retained possession of most church property ( including a great repository of religious architecture and other items , though some were later destroyed ) despite its numerical minority , however , the church of ireland remained the official state church until it was disestablished on 1 january 1871 by the liberal government under william ewart gladstone while the lordship of ireland had existed since the 12th century and nominally owed allegiance to the english monarchy , many kingdoms of gaelic ireland continued to exist ; this came to an end with the kingdom of ireland , where the whole island was brought under the centralised control of an anglocentric system based in dublin this phase of irish history marked the beginning of an officially organised policy of settler colonialism , orchestrated from london and the incorporation of ireland into the british empire ( indeed ireland is sometimes called '' england 's first colony '' ) the nominal religion of the native majority and its clergy ; the catholic church in ireland ; was actively persecuted by the state and a set of penal laws in favour of the church of ireland , highly damaging to the native irish catholics , although a similar experience happened to english , scottish and welsh catholics during the same period on the other hand , the fact that the kingdom had been a unitary state gave irish nationalists in 1912â€“22 a reason to expect that in the process of increasing self-government the island of ireland would be treated as a single political unit this may have been an aspirational depiction for a putative high-king , for it was not related to the lordship of ireland at that time by the english king , who only assumed the title '' king of ireland '' later in the reign of henry viii o'donnell , francis martin
