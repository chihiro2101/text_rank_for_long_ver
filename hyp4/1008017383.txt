this circle had no relationship with the court , and the name of augustus is found nowhere in the writings of tibullus tibullus had no liking for war , and though his life seems to have been divided between rome and his country estate , his own preferences were wholly for the country life tibullus 's first book consists of poems written at various times between 30 and 26 his first love , the subject of book i sometimes she appears as single , sometimes as married ; but we hear nothing either of her marriage or of her husband 's death in addition , several elegies in book i concern themselves with tibullus 's love for a boy , who is named marathus the three poems centered on marathus constitute the longest poetic project in roman literature having homosexual love as theme the first of these poems , 1.4 , begins with an imprecation of the poet to the god priapus , asking for advice on how to win over beautiful boys at first the narrator of the poem presents himself as someone who is simply asking for advice from the god on behalf of a friend who fell in love with a boy but whose wife forbids such affairs ( 1.4.73 ) this poem can be seen as part of the narrator 's efforts to win marathus ' goodwill by performing a series of humiliating tasks for him , exceeding the god 's counsel to perform hard physical labors for the lad , by also helping him carry on an affairs with someone else initially , the narrator asks the gods for compassion towards marathus ( 1.9.5–6 ) , who betrayed a promise he had made to the narrator , but soon love yields to bitterness , and he begins to express the desire that the gifts of the rival lover turn to ashes ( 1.9.11–12 ) and that the same happen to the poems that the narrator wrote to marathus to win him over ( 1.9.48–49 ) , of which he is now ashamed finally , the poet addresses marathus , telling him that he will cry when he sees the poet fall in love with another capricious lad ( 1.9.79–80 ) , but declaring himself , for the moment being , finally released from unfaithful love about the second book , scholars can only say that in all likelihood it was published before the poet 's death in 19 bc in the second book the place of delia is taken by '' nemesis '' , which is also a fictitious name '' ( '' thus nemesis and delia will be long remembered : one tibullus ' recent love , the other his first though the character of tibullus the historical man is unclear , the character of his poetic persona is reflected in his works his clear , finished and yet unaffected style made him a great favourite and placed him , in the judgment of quintilian , ahead of other elegy writers on the other hand , much of the work attributed to him is that of others the third book , which contains 290 verses , is by a much inferior hand the fourth book consists of poems of very different quality 2-6 , containing ninety-four lines , in which the theme of the attachment is worked up into five graceful poems they are very short , only forty lines in all ; but they have a unique interest as being the only love poems by a roman woman that have survived later analysis has concluded that sulpicia is an adept poet with a very high level of skill , playing upon gender norms in the celebration of her erotic relationship and play upon her '' fama '' as a poet and a woman of high status the fourteenth is a little epigram of four lines with nothing to determine its authorship 2-6 to tibullus himself ; but the style is different , and it is best to answer the question , as biihrens does , with a non liquet 13 ( verse 13 , '' nunc licet e caelo mittatur amica tibullo '' - '' now grant that a lover be sent from heaven to tibullus '' ) to tibullus probably led to its inclusion in the collection and later on to the addition of the third book to the two genuine ones to sum up : the third and fourth books appear in the oldest tradition as a single book , and they comprise pieces by different authors in different styles , none of which can be assigned to tibullus with any certainty when this '' messalla collection '' was made can not be exactly determined ; but it was definitely not till after the death of tibullus , 19 bc , and perhaps as late as the late 1st century ad besides the foregoing , two pieces in the collection called priapea ( one an epigram and the other a longer piece in iambics ) have been attributed to tibullus ; but there is little external and no internal evidence of his authorship the greater part of the poems are included in postgate 's selections ( with english notes , 1903 ) scholar francis cairns regards tibullus as '' a good poet but not a great one '' ; dorothea wender similarly calls him a minor poet but argues there is '' grace and polish and symmetry '' to his work .
