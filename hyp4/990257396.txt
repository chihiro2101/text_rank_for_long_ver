two particularly notable raids were the coventry blitz on 14 november 1940 , and the blitz on london on the night of 29 december/30 december 1940 , which was the most destructive raid on london during the war with much of the destruction caused by fires started by incendiary bombs but after the lessons learned during the blitz , the tactic of dropping a high concentration of bombs over the target in the shortest time possible became standard in the raf as it was more effective than a longer raid for example , during the coventry blitz on the night of 14/15 november 1940 , 515 luftwaffe bombers , many flying more than one sortie against coventry , delivered their bombs over a period of time lasting more than 10 hours in contrast , the much more devastating raid on dresden on the night of 13/14 of february 1945 by two waves of the raf bomber command 's main force , involved their bombs being released at 22:14 , with all but one of the 254 lancaster bombers releasing their bombs within two minutes , and the last one released at 22:22 this means that in the first raid , on average , one lancaster dropped a full load of bombs every half a second and in the second larger raid that involved more than one raf bomber group , one every three seconds the next mission was another high altitude daylight incendiary raid against tokyo on 25 february when 172 b-29s destroyed around of the snow-covered city , dropping 453.7 tons of mostly incendiaries with some fragmentation bombs changing to low-altitude night tactics to concentrate the fire damage while minimizing the effectiveness of fighter and artillery defenses , the operation meetinghouse raid carried out by 279 b-29s raided tokyo again on the night of 9/10 march , dropped 1,665 tons of incendiaries from altitudes of , mostly using the e-46 cluster bomb which released 38 m-69 incendiary cluster bomb at an altitude of the first to arrive dropped bombs in a large x pattern centered in tokyo 's working class district near the docks ; later aircraft simply aimed near this flaming x
