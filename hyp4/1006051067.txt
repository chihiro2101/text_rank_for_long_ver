lipoylation ( a type of acylation ) , attachment of a lipoate ( c 8 ) functional group flavin moiety ( fmn or fad ) may be covalently attached heme c attachment via thioether bonds with cysteines phosphopantetheinylation , the addition of a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety from coenzyme a , as in fatty acid , polyketide , non-ribosomal peptide and leucine biosynthesis retinylidene schiff base formation uridine monophosphate , ump ) , usually to tyrosine propionylation pyroglutamate formation s-glutathionylation s-nitrosylation s-sulfenylation ( aka s-sulphenylation ) , reversible covalent addition of one oxygen atom to the thiol group of a cysteine residue s-sulfinylation , normally irreversible covalent addition of two oxygen atoms to the thiol group of a cysteine residue s-sulfonylation , normally irreversible covalent addition of three oxygen atoms to the thiol group of a cysteine residue , resulting in the formation of a cysteic acid residue succinylation addition of a succinyl group to lysine sulfation , the addition of a sulfate group to a tyrosine glycation , the addition of a sugar molecule to a protein without the controlling action of an enzyme spontaneous isopeptide bond formation , as found in many surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria biotinylation : covalent attachment of a biotin moiety using a biotinylation reagent , typically for the purpose of labeling a protein carbamylation : the addition of isocyanic acid to a protein 's n-terminus or the side-chain of lys or cys residues , typically resulting from exposure to urea solutions protein sequences contain sequence motifs that are recognized by modifying enzymes , and which can be documented or predicted in ptm databases phosphositeplus – a database of comprehensive information and tools for the study of mammalian protein post-translational modification proteomescout – a database of proteins and post-translational modifications experimentally human protein reference database – a database for different modifications and understand different proteins , their class , and function/process related to disease causing proteins prosite – a database of consensus patterns for many types of ptm ’ s including sites protein information resource ( pir ) – a database to acquire a collection of annotations and structures for ptms dbptm – a database that shows different ptm 's and information regarding their chemical components/structures and a frequency for amino acid modified site uniprot has ptm information although that may be less comprehensive than in more specialized databases post-translational modifications consisting of epigenetic alterations of histone protein tails in specific regions of the brain appear to be crucial to the molecular basis of addictions after 7 days of nicotine treatment of mice , the post-translational modifications consisting of acetylation of both histone h3 and histone h4 was increased at the fosb promoter in the nucleus accumbens of the brain , causing a 61 % increase in fosb expression similarly , after 15 days of nicotine treatment of rats , the post-translational modification consisting of 3-fold increased acetylation of histone h4 occurs at the promoter of the dopamine d1 receptor ( drd1 ) gene in the prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) of the rats in rats exposed to alcohol for up to 5 days , there was an increase in the post-translational modification of histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation , h3k9ac , in the nociceptin promoter in the brain amygdala complex repeated cocaine administration in mice induces post-translational modifications including hyperacetylation of histone h3 or histone h4 at 1,696 genes in one brain reward region the nucleus accumbens and deacetylation at 206 genes at least 45 genes , shown in previous studies to be upregulated in the nucleus accumbens of mice after chronic cocaine exposure , were found to be associated with post-translational hyperacetylation of histone h3 or histone h4
