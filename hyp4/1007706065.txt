because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them , an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system a specialized form of analog synthesizer is the analog vocoder , based on equipment developed for speech synthesis electronic synthesizers quickly become a standard part of the popular-music repertoire because of the complexity of generating even a single note using analog synthesis , most synthesizers remained monophonic the polymoog was an attempt to create a truly polyphonic analog synthesizer , with sound generation circuitry for every key on the keyboard however , its architecture resembled an electronic organ more than a traditional analog synthesizer , and the polymoog was not widely imitated also during this period , a number of analog/digital hybrid synthesizers were introduced , which replaced certain sound-producing functions with digital equivalents , for example the digital oscillators in synthesizers like the korg dw-8000 ( which played back pcm samples of various waveforms ) and the kawai k5 ( waveforms constructed via additive synthesis ) the demand for the analog synth sound led to development of a variety of analog modeling synthesizers—which emulate analog vcos and vcfs using samples , software , or specialized digital circuitry , and the construction of new analog keyboard synths such as the alesis andromeda , prophet '08 , and little phatty , as well as semi-modular and modular units the lapse of patents in recent years , such as for the moog synthesizer transistor ladder filter , has spurred a return of diy and kit synthesizer modules , as well as an increase in the number of commercial companies selling analog modules another factor considered to have increased use of analog synths since the 1990s is weariness with the complex screen-based navigation systems of digital synths , with the '' hands-on '' , practical controls of analog synths—potentiometer knobs , faders , and other features—offering a strong appeal arp synthesizer patents modular analog synthesizers return ! – a discussion of modern modular equipment with links to major manufacturers
