consumption and in tune with the music that jamaicans had experienced when sound systems performed live another trend was sound clash albums , featuring rival deejays /or sound systems competing head-to-head for the appreciation of a live audience , with underground sound clash cassettes often documenting the violence that came with such rivalries especially because the audience of dancehall

that is inseparable from sound system culture the term ‘ dancehall ’ , while now typically used in reference to the specific and uniquely jamaican genre of music , originally referred to a physical location at the onset of the dancehall scene , sound systems were the only way that some jamaican audiences might hear the latest songs from popular artist through time , it transformed to where the purveyors of the sound systems were the artists themselves and they became whom the people came to see along with their own original sounds since many locals could n't afford sound systems in their home , listening to one at a dance party or at a festival was their entry into audible bliss writer brougtton and brewster 's book last night a dj saved my life states that sound systems were a product of jamaican social lifestyle music became a factor of many elements and the physicality of that sound was a strategic puzzle left for musicians to solve through their dancehall live concerts , many performers found a place to use their voice and make a mark due to the opportunities afforded by innercity promotions it was far removed from reggae 's gentle roots and culture , and there was much debate among purists as to whether it should be considered an extension of reggae unlike earlier dancehall , this new evolution was characterized by structures of music commonly heard in mainstream pop music , such as repeated choruses , melodic tunes , and hooks dancehall saw a new wave of popularity in western markets in the mid-late 2010s , with immense commercial success being achieved by a number of dancehall-pop singles , including rihanna 's '' work '' ( 2016 ) and drake 's '' one dance '' and '' controlla '' ( 2016 ) a variety of western artists have spoken of being

dancehall had re-emerged into global popularity , artists such as alkaline , popcaan , masicka , aidonia and rygin king are known as some of the most profound and active artists of this period to date

that first became popular in 1985 with the release of ‘ sleng teng , ’ whose success made the accessibility of digitally-composed riddims apparent ( manuel-marshall , p riddims and lyric sets are not exclusive to any one artist , and these can be and are spread around with one particular riddim , ‘ real rock , ’ first recorded in 1967 for a song of the same name , being used in at least 269 songs by 2006 over the course of 39 years here , the term might describe the links between different artists via shared riddims and lyric sets and through common experiences incorporated into the music some of jamaica 's significant memories of itself are inscribed in the dancehall space , and therefore dancehall can be seen as a site of collective memory that functions as ritualized memorializing , a memory bank of the old , new , and dynamic bodily movements , spaces , performers , and performance aesthetics of the new world and jamaica in particular thus , dancehall in jamaica is yet another example of the way that the music and dance cultures of the african diaspora have challenged the passive consumerism of mass cultural forms , such as recorded music , by creating a sphere of active cultural production that potentially may transform the prevailing hegemony of society ” in discussion of the possibility of a self identifying homosexual dancer performing to homophobic music she writes , “ in appropriating the culture and working from within its very center , he produces a bodily performance that gains him power eventually , dancehall artists started to create songs that either invented new dances or formalized some moves done by dancehall goers many dance moves seen in hip hop videos are actually variations of dancehall dances hope argues that this trend is related to the rise of market capitalism as a dominant feature of life in jamaica , coupled with the role of new media and a liberalized media landscape , where images become of increasing importance in the

references to guns and violence in lyrics , with cooper responding by arguing that the emergence of firearms was less a sign of genuinely violent undercurrents in dancehall and more a theatrical adoption of the role of guns as tools of power gunfire as a form of cheering has extended beyond dancehall culture with the phrase “ pram , pram ! ” becoming a general expression of approval or support nine ’ interpreting the song as a denouncement of what cooper describes as gun culture gone out of control part of the criticism of jamaican dancehall appears to be the product of cultural clash stemming from a lack of insider knowledge on the nuances of the music ’ s content and the culture surrounding said music after the popularizing of buju banton 's dancehall song '' boom bye bye

rastafari movement influence as well in her paper '' out and bad : toward a queer performance hermeneutic in jamaican dancehall '' , nadia ellis explains that queer masculine expression is allowed in specific situations within jamaican culture with “ homophobic lyrics actually opening up a space for increasingly free expression ” explicitly homophobic songs such as “ boom bye bye ” are constantly replayed at dancehall venues , despite the fact that the culture is defined by constant renewal and the search for the new these songs , despite often being over ten years old , are actually necessary
