the idea of an east-to-west waterway link across southern england was first mentioned in elizabethan times , between 1558 and 1603 , to take advantage of the proximity of tributaries of the rivers avon and thames , only apart at their closest later , around 1626 , henry briggs made a survey of the two rivers and noted that the land between them was level and easy to dig the main alternative to road transport for the carriage of goods between bristol and london was a hazardous sea route through the english channel in 1723 , despite considerable local opposition , the kennet navigation opened , comprising stretches of natural riverbed alternating with of artificially created lock cuts the river avon had historically been navigable from bristol to bath , but construction of watermills on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure the two river navigations were built independently of one another , in order to meet local needs , but they eventually led to plans to connect them and form a through route the following year the engineers barns , simcock and weston submitted a proposed route for this canal , although there were doubts about the adequacy of the water supply the name was changed from western canal to kennet and avon canal to avoid confusion with the grand western canal , which was being proposed at the same time the opening of the great western railway in 1841 removed much of the canal 's traffic , even though the canal company lowered tariffs in the 1870s water abstraction from the canal near fobney lock followed the regulations introduced in the reading local board waterworks , sewerage , drainage and improvements act of 1870 , and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal they were generally built close to road and rail bridges , which would have formed important crossing points for enemy troops and vehicles after the war the transport act of 1947 transferred control of the canal to the british transport commission , but by the 1950s large sections of the canal had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the avoncliff aqueduct they were supported by a 22,000-signature petition to the queen , brought to london from bristol by water ; parts of the canal had to be traversed by canoe the county council in berkshire , supported by local councils , estimated that £1,275,000 was needed for works at the eastern end of the canal and commenced work on replacing some of the bridges the restoration of the dundas aqueduct and several smaller schemes were later added to the list the work funded included complete rebuilding of foxhangers lock and bridge at caen hill , replacement of lock gates at seend and crofton , channel lining at claverton , embankment repairs at martinslade , improvements at claverton pumping station and dredging at various sites between 2002 and 2004 the dundas aqueduct , which had been relined with polythene and concrete in 1984 without disturbing a colony of bats living under the aqueduct , was further restored by the replacement of engineering bricks used by the great western railway with bath stone to match the original work in november 2011 the navigation between bath and bristol was closed for several months because of safety concerns about victoria bridge the river avon was navigable from bristol to bath during the early years of the 13th century , until the construction of mills on the river forced its closure it is the first lock east of netham , the upstream limit of the floating harbour , beyond the suburbs of the city of bristol the river passes under the old railway line that now forms the avon valley railway , a heritage railway , before reaching swineford lock the bristol and bath railway path crosses the navigation several times before reaching the suburb of newbridge on the outskirts of bath its construction created an island between the cut and the river weir , which became known as dutch island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century the new chamber has a depth of , making it the uk 's second-deepest canal lock above the top lock the canal passes through sydney gardens via two short tunnels and under two cast iron footbridges dating from 1800 the canal turns south into a valley between bathampton wood and bathford hill which includes brown 's folly , a biological and geological site of special scientific interest in the avon valley to the east of bath the classic geographical example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found : road , rail , river , canal the canal passes the remains of a loading dock , once used for bath stone from the quarries on bathampton down , which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the dry arch rock bridge ( demolished in 1958 to allow double-decker buses to use the a36 ) at the western end of the dundas aqueduct it is joined by the remains of the somerset coal canal , a short stretch of which has been restored to create the brassknocker basin after the avoncliff aqueduct the canal passes through barton farm country park , past gripwood quarry and a 14th-century grade ii listed tithe barn , long and wide , on its way into bradford on avon the main flight of 16 locks , which take 5–6 hours & nbsp ; to navigate in a boat , is part of a longer series of 29 locks built in three groups : seven at foxhangers , sixteen at caen hill , and six at the town end of the flight the locks were the last part of the route of the canal to be completed as a result , the 16 & nbsp ; locks utilise unusually large side ponds to store the water needed for their operation while the locks were under construction in the early 19th century a tramroad provided a link between foxhangers at the bottom of the flight and devizes at the top , the remains of which can be seen in the towpath arches in the road bridges over the canal at the top of the flight is devizes wharf , home to the kennet & avon canal museum , which has a range of exhibits on the conception , design , usage , and eventual commercial decline of the kennet and avon canal , as well as its subsequent restoration they built many of the boats used on the canals of southern england before closing in about 1950 it was roughly half-way along the canal and served as a bakehouse , slaughterhouse and shop for provisions for those living and working on the canal between wootton top lock and crofton is the summit pound of the canal at above sea level , stretching for about and including the bruce tunnel the tunnel is named after the local land owner , thomas brudenell-bruce , 1st earl of ailesbury ( 1729–1814 ) , who refused to allow a deep cutting through his property and insisted on a tunnel a number of usable springs were found adjacent to the canal route about east of the summit pound , and about below it , and arrangements were made for them to feed the pound below lock 60 at crofton some years later the wilton water reservoir was created to enhance the supply to this pound using the springs and the river dun water is pumped to the summit at the western end of the locks , from wilton water , by the restored crofton pumping station hungerford marsh lock is unique on the kennet and avon canal in that it has a swing bridge directly over the centre of the lock that must be opened before the lock may be used the stretch from newbury to high bridge in reading is an improved river navigation known as the kennet navigation , opened in 1723 monkey marsh lock at thatcham is one of only two remaining working examples of turf-sided locks on the canal today shortly after passing fobney lock and the associated water treatment works , the kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the thames flood plain at county lock the river enters the centre of reading , where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large brewery the last of the river kennet in reading below the bridge has been navigable since at least the 13th century because there is no wide floodplain , wharves could be built during the middle ages that allowed reading to establish itself as a river port originally this short stretch of river , which includes blake 's lock , was under the control of reading abbey , but today it is administered by the environment agency as if it were part of the river thames it is a favourite haunt of several famous canal enthusiasts including canal boat veterans and original kennet and avon restoration supporters , prunella scales and timothy west under a partnership arrangement involving british waterways , sustrans , and the riparian local authorities , two main sections of the canal have been improved , and , with a few short diversions , run from reading to marsh benham and from devizes to bath as part of the national cycle network ( ncn ) route 4 there are also many non-statutory nature reserves along the canal
