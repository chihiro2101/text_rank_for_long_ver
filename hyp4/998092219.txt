wine making technology improved considerably with the ancient greeks but it was n't until the end of the roman empire that cultivation techniques as we know them were common throughout europe due to the often much more fertile new world growing conditions , attention has focussed heavily on managing the vine 's more vigorous growth numbers of new world vineyard plantings have been increasing almost as fast as european vineyards are being uprooted the size of individual vineyards in the new world is significant there have also been significant changes in the kinds of grapes that are grown grape changes are often in response to changing consumer demand but sometimes result from vine pull schemes designed to promote vineyard change alternatively , the development of '' t '' budding now permits the grafting of a different grape variety onto existing rootstock in the vineyard , making it possible to switch varieties within a two-year period local legislation often dictates which varieties are selected , how they are grown , whether vineyards can be irrigated and exactly when grapes can be harvested , all of which in serves to reinforce tradition however , they were largely planted in varieties with tough skins that could be transported across the country to home wine-makers and the resulting wine was of a low quality for this reason , some of the best wines come from vineyards planted on quite steep hills , conditions which would make most other agricultural products uneconomic the stereotypical vineyard site for wine grapes ( in the northern hemisphere ) is a hillside in a dry climate with a southern exposure , good drainage to reduce unnecessary water uptake , and balanced pruning to force the vine to put more of its energy into the fruit , rather than foliage
