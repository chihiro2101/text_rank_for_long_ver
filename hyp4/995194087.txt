this distance reduces excessive movement being transmitted from the kite to the camera and allows the kite to be flown into higher , stable air before the camera is attached in order to take photographs that are oriented correctly with the horizon , a suspension method is used to allow the rig to automatically level itself under the kite line the shutter of the camera can be released in several ways , depending on the type of camera and complexity of the rig electronics , if used several automatic controllers have been developed that can take a photo , move the camera by a set angle , take the next photo and so on the most important aspect of any kite used to lift a camera is stability generally , single lined kites are used as they allow very long line lengths and need less intervention from the flyer than steerable designs as weight increases , specific designs are chosen for their additional flying characteristics , such as line pull , wind speed , flying angle and ease of launch sparred kites such as the rokkaku or delta tend to fly at a higher angle than parafoils , which is of benefit when the space between the launch site and photographic subject is limited in latter years , kits have become available that enable a beginner to quickly assemble a functional kap rig and start taking aerial pictures in the visible part of the spectrum and , with more experience , in the ultra-violet , near and thermal infra-red parts of the spectrum too practical and commercial use of kap is limited by the unpredictability of the weather ( notably wind , sun and rain ) and the fact that not every site is suitable to flying a kite
