the changing of society and the military class ( samurai ) taking power at the end of the first millennium created a requirement for education in archery in the latter part of the 15th century heki danjō masatsugu revolutionized archery with his new and accurate approach called hi , kan , chū ( fly , pierce , center ) , and his footman 's archery spread rapidly the yumi as a weapon was used alongside the tanegashima for a period of time because of its longer reach , accuracy and especially because it had a rate of fire 30–40 times faster there was an extended era of peace during which the samurai moved to administrative duty , although the traditional fighting skills were still esteemed during this period archery became a '' voluntary '' skill , practised partly in the court in ceremonial form , partly as different kinds of competition archery spread also outside the warrior class earlier archery had been called kyūjutsu , the skill of bow , but monks acting even as martial arts teachers led to creation of a new concept : kyūdō guidelines published in the 1953 kyūdō kyohon define how , in a competition or graduation , archers from different schools can shoot together in unified form for this a phrase seisha hitchū , '' true shooting , certain hitting '' , is used to harmonize practice and ceremonial shooting ( sharei ) in 1953 the all nippon kyūdō federation ( ankf ) formed an establishing committee from the main schools to take the best elements of each school and form the ankf style that is used today throughout japan and in most kyūdō federations in the west in kyūdō there are three kinds of practice ( geiko ) : mitori geiko & nbsp ; – receiving with the eyes the style and technique of an advanced archer , kufū geiko & nbsp ; – learning and keeping in mind the details of the technique and spiritual effort to realize it and kazu geiko & nbsp ; – repetition through which the technique is personified in one 's own shooting the second step for a beginner is to do karabiki training with a bow without an arrow to learn handling of the bow and performing hassetsu until full draw next steps may vary from teacher to teacher , but include practising first yugamae , then the draw and last release and shooting at makiwara there are three levels of skill : tōteki , the arrow hits the target yumi shafts are traditionally made of bamboo , wood and leather using techniques which have not changed for centuries , although some archers ( particularly , those new to the art ) may use synthetic ( i.e typically the primary reason an archer may choose a stronger glove like the yotsugake is to assist in pulling heavier bows and above ) this is only a generalization and many schools differ on which glove to use for their bows and glove use often varies from archer to archer and school to school during the draw , the thumb of the archer is typically placed on the last gloved finger of the drawing hand , with the first ( or , in the case of a yotsugake , the first and index fingers ) being placed gently on either the thumb or the arrow shaft itself the extra finger allows for a stronger hold on the thumb , as it is then placed on the third finger of the hand instead of the second the one-finger glove , called an ippongake is generally used for beginners and covers only the thumb the five-finger glove , called a morogake , is used almost exclusively by ogasawara ryū practitioners , and is not typically used in competition or by any other school the shitagake comes in two varieties , three-fingered and four-fingered , depending on whether it is used under the mitsugake or the yotsugake thumb because of the unique shooting technique of kyūdō , protection on the left ( bow ) arm is not generally required the bow string , when properly released , will travel around the bow hand , coming to rest on the outside of the arm however , on rare occasions a bow hand glove , called an oshidegake , is used , which serves to protect the left thumb from injury from the arrow and fletching recently , however , plastic tsurumakis are also coming into use many archers also have small containers of fudeko and giriko attached to the end of the tsurumaki strap ; these containers are called fudeko-ire and giriko-ire and are traditionally made of horn or antler ( though many modern archers have fudeko-ire and giriko-ire made of plastic ) all kyūdō archers hold the bow in their left hand and draw the string with their right , so that all archers face the higher position ( kamiza ) while shooting if done improperly , upon release the string may strike the archer 's ear or side of the face resulting from the technique to release the shot , the bow will ( for a practised archer ) spin in the hand so that the string stops in front of the archer 's outer forearm this action of yugaeri is a combination of technique and the natural working of the bow during competition , an archer may have a second set of arrows sitting on the ground at the feet the archer starts bringing down the bow while spreading his arms , simultaneously pushing the bow with the left hand and drawing the string with the right the archer continues the movement started in the previous phase , until full draw is achieved with the arrow placed slightly below the cheekbone or level with the mouth the technique results in the bowstring being released from the right hand and the right arm extending behind the archer using a system which is common to modern budō ( martial art ) practices , most western kyūdō schools periodically hold examinations , which , if the archer passes , results in the conveying of a grade , which can be kyū or dan level often testing includes many archers and may take as much as 6 to 8 hours to test all of the prospective students competition is usually held with a great deal more ceremony than the standard dōjō practice in addition to the hassetsu , the archer must also perform an elaborate entering procedure whereby the archer will join up to four other archers to enter the dōjō , bow to the adjudicators , step up to the back line known as the honza and then kneel in a form of sitting known as kiza the archers then move in lock-step fashion through the hassetsu , each archer standing and shooting one after another at the respective targets , kneeling between each shot , until they have exhausted their supply of arrows ( generally four ) during normal competition , this process is done with the archers standing , however , the complete shooting procedure includes having the archer kneel in kiza while waiting between each shot heki tō-ryū ) （印西派）（日置当流） heki-ryū sekka-ha（雪荷派） heki-ryū dōsetsu-ha（道雪派） honda-ryū（本多流） ogasawara-ryū ( 小笠原流 ) yamato-ryū（大和流） in addition to the major traditions , there are many more recent and often more spiritual schools that are active outside japan judo , karate ) , kyūdō is one of the japanese martial arts that has not seen large amounts of mainstream interest in the west one arrow , one life kasagake - a type of japanese mounted archery ; in contrast to yabusame , the types of targets are various and the archer shoots without stopping the horse shihan mato – a traditional style of japanese archery using a short bow from a seated position
