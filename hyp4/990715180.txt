elements can also be divided into active and passive : active elements or sourcesthese are elements which can source electrical power ; examples are voltage sources and current sources dependent sourcesthese are two-port elements with a voltage or current source which is proportional to the voltage or current at a second pair of terminals another distinction is between linear and nonlinear : linear elementsthese are elements in which the constituent relation , the relation between voltage and current , is a linear function each element is defined by a relation between the state variables of the network : current , i ; voltage , v , charge , q ; and magnetic flux , \phi here \phi is the time integral of voltage but whether or not that represents a physical quantity depends on the nature of the voltage source for a voltage generated by magnetic induction it is meaningful , but for an electrochemical source , or a voltage that is the output of another circuit , no physical meaning is attached to it three passive elements : resistance r , measured in ohms – produces a voltage proportional to the current flowing through the element capacitance c , measured in farads – produces a current proportional to the rate of change of voltage across the element four abstract active elements : voltage-controlled voltage source ( vcvs ) generates a voltage based on another voltage with respect to a specified gain voltage-controlled current source ( vccs ) generates a current based on a voltage elsewhere in the circuit , with respect to a specified gain , used to model field-effect transistors and vacuum tubes ( has infinite input impedance and infinite output impedance ) current-controlled voltage source ( ccvs ) generates a voltage based on an input current elsewhere in the circuit with respect to a specified gain from this it is supposed that there is a theoretical fourth passive element since there are only five elements in total ( not including the various dependent sources ) found in linear network analysis this is the case for all linear elements , but also for example , an ideal diode , which in circuit theory terms is a non-linear resistor , has a constitutive relation of the form v f ( i ) there are also two special non-linear elements which are sometimes used in analysis but which are not the ideal counterpart of any real component : nullator : defined as v i 0 norator : defined as an element which places no restrictions on voltage and current whatsoever there are two lossless , passive , linear two-port elements that are normally introduced into network analysis however , transformer , capacitance and inductance are normally retained in analysis because they are the ideal properties of the basic physical components transformer , inductor and capacitor whereas a practical gyrator must be constructed as an active circuit the following are examples of representation of components by way of electrical elements a more refined model also includes a resistance in series with the voltage source , to represent the battery 's internal resistance ( which results in the battery heating and the voltage dropping when in use ) for example , on a first degree of approximation , a bipolar transistor may be represented by a variable current source that is controlled by the input current
