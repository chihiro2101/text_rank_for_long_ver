such surveys commonly are conducted by national organizations or under their supervision or the standards they have approved , particularly when the use is for the purposes of chart making and distribution or the dredging of state-controlled waters industrial entities installing submarine communications cables hydrographic information and the submarine cable industry or power bel submarine cable survey complete require detailed surveys of cable routes prior to installation and increasingly use acoustic imagery equipment previously found only in military applications when conducting their surveys utec surveyor equipped for deep ocean cable route surveys specialized companies exist that haveboth the equipment and expertise to contract with both commercial and governmental entities to perform such surveys here , volunteer vessels record position , depth , and time data using their standard navigation instruments , and then the data is post-processed to account for speed of sound , tidal , and other corrections with this approach there is no need for a specific survey vessel , or for professionally qualified surveyors to be on board , as the expertise is in the data processing that occurs once the data is uploaded to the server after the voyage the process was labor-intensive and time-consuming and , although each individual depth measurement could be accurate , even a thorough survey as a practical matter could include only a limited number of sounding measurements relative to the area being surveyed , inevitably leaving gaps in coverage between single soundings this greatly increased the speed of acquiring sounding data over that possible with lead lines and sounding poles by allowing information on depths beneath a vessel to be gathered in a series of lines spaced at a specified distance however , it shared the weakness of earlier methods by lacking depth information for areas in between the strips of sea bottom the vessel sounded this method revolutionized hydrographic surveying , as it allowed a quicker , less laborious , and far more complete survey of an area than did the use of lead lines and sounding poles coast and geodetic survey , and later the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , fielded a pair of sister ships of identical design specifically to work together on such surveys sidescan sonar could create images of underwater obstructions with the same fidelity as aerial photography , while multibeam systems could generate depth data for 100 percent of the bottom in a surveyed area 1.3 of contract specifications for hydrographic surveys , land information new zealand in a set of contract survey requirements , is a clear indication that the wider hydrographic community is embracing the benefits that can be accrued by employing mbes technology and , in particular , are accepting as a fact that a mbes which provides acoustic backscatter data is a valuable tool of the trade , ( 2019 ) , multispectral acoustic backscatter : how useful is it for marine habitat mapping and management ? , journal of coastal research , 35 ( 5 ) , pp 1062-1079 continues the trajectory of technological innovations providing the hydrographic surveying community with better tools for more rapidly acquiring better data for multiple uses in the late 1960 's , single beam hydrographic surveys were conducted using widely spaced track lines and the shallow ( peak ) soundings in the bottom data were retained in preference to deeper soundings in the sounding record during that same time period , early side scan sonar was introduced into the operational practices of shallow water hydrographic surveying in 1979 , in hopes of a technological solution to the problems of surveying in '' floating mud '' , the director of the national ocean survey ( nos ) established a nos study team to conduct investigations to determine the functional specifications for a replacement shallow water depth sounder ( 1981 ) , a study of future depth recorder requirements , international hydrographic review , lviii ( 2 ) the outcome of the study was a class of vertical-beam depth sounders , which is still widely used , ( 2010 ) , an introduction into underwater acoustics : principles and applications , 2nd ed , isbn-13 : 978-3540784807 , springer subsequent to the early mbes bathymetric surveys and at the time when single frequency side scan sonar had begun to produce high quality images of the seabed that were capable of providing a degree of discrimination between different types of sediments , the potential of the echo amplitudes from a mbes was recognized , ( 2009 ) , the emphasis for shallow water surveying migrated toward full bottom coverage surveys by employing mbes with increasing operating frequencies to further improve the spatial resolution of the soundings given that side scan sonar , with its across-track fan-shaped swath of insonification , had successfully exploited the cross-track variation in echo amplitudes , to achieve high quality images of the seabed , it seemed a natural progression that the fan-shaped across-track pattern of insonification associated with the new monotone higher frequency shallow water mbes , might also be exploited for seabed imagery at one time different data collection methods and standards were used in collecting hydrographic data for maritime safety and for scientific or engineering bathymetric charts , but increasingly , with the aid of improved collection techniques and computer processing , the data is collected under one standard and extracted for specific use depending on the final use intended for the data ( for example , navigation charts , digital terrain model , volume calculation for dredging , topography , or bathymetry ) this data must be thinned out usually the surveyor has additional data collection equipment on site to record the data required for correcting the soundings although the accuracy of crowd-sourced surveying can rarely reach the standards of traditional methods , the algorithms used rely on a high data density to produce final results that are more accurate than single measurements
