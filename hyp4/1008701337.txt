a number of wireless electrical signaling schemes including sending electric currents through water and the ground using electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were investigated for telegraphy in the late 19th century before practical radio systems became available these included a patented induction system by thomas edison allowing a telegraph on a running train to connect with telegraph wires running parallel to the tracks , a william preece induction telegraph system for sending messages across bodies of water , and several operational and proposed telegraphy and voice earth conduction systems in 1894 , guglielmo marconi began developing a wireless telegraph system using radio waves , which had been known about since proof of their existence in 1888 by heinrich hertz , but discounted as a communication format since they seemed , at the time , to be a short range phenomenon the wireless revolution has been driven by advances in radio frequency ( rf ) and microwave engineering , including the transition from analog to digital rf technology along with the migration to metal–oxide–semiconductor ( mos ) based multi-carrier rf power amplifiers , which enabled a substantial increase in voice traffic along with the delivery of digital data such as text messaging , images and streaming media another widely used example is consumer ir devices such as remote controls and irda ( infrared data association ) networking , which is used as an alternative to wifi networking to allow laptops , pdas , printers , and digital cameras to exchange data common examples of wireless equipment include : tech target – definition of wireless – posted by margaret rouse ( april 2 control and traffic control systems infrared and ultrasonic remote control devices professional lmr ( land mobile radio ) and smr ( specialized mobile radio ) typically used by business , industrial and public safety entities airband and radio navigation equipment used by aviators and air traffic control cellular telephones and pagers : provide connectivity for portable and mobile applications , both personal and business in the absence of such control or alternative arrangements such as a privatized electromagnetic spectrum , chaos might result if , for example , airlines did not have specific frequencies to work under and an amateur radio operator was interfering with a pilot 's ability to land an aircraft one of the best-known examples of wireless technology is the mobile phone , also known as a cellular phone , with more than 6.6 & nbsp ; billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide as of the end of 2010 they can be used within range of the cell site used to house the equipment required to transmit and receive the radio signals from these instruments wireless internet service : an introduction supporting technologies include : : wi-fi is a wireless local area network that enables portable computing devices to connect easily with other devices , peripheries , and the internet ilcev , stojce dimov , global mobile satellite communications for maritime , land and aeronautical applications , springer , 2006 : wireless sensor networks are responsible for sensing noise , interference , and activity in data collection networks 2013 wireless data communications are used to span a distance beyond the capabilities of typical cabling in point-to-point communication and point-to-multipoint communication , to provide a backup communications link in case of normal network failure , to link portable or temporary workstations , to overcome situations where normal cabling is difficult or financially impractical , or to remotely connect mobile users or networks there are two different fundamental methods for wireless energy transfer wireless energy transfer may be combined with wireless information transmission in what is known as wireless powered communication the mban works by sending low powered wireless signals to receivers that feed into nursing stations or monitoring sites
