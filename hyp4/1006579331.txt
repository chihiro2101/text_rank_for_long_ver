for several millennia before the onset of industrialisation , design , technical expertise , and manufacturing were often done by individual craftsmen , who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation , according to their own manual skill , the requirements of their clients , experience accumulated through their own experimentation , and knowledge passed on to them through training or apprenticeship the first use of the term '' industrial design '' is often attributed to the industrial designer joseph claude sinel in 1919 ( although he himself denied this in interviews ) , but the discipline predates 1919 by at least a decade the subtitle of the ( translated ) work explains , that it wants to offer a '' complete course of mechanical , engineering , and architectural drawing '' the study of those types of technical drawing , according to armengaud , belong to the field of industrial design robert lepper helped to establish one of the country 's first industrial design degree programs in 1934 at carnegie institute of technology various schools of industrial design specialize in one of these aspects , ranging from pure art colleges and design schools ( product styling ) , to mixed programs of engineering and design , to related disciplines such as exhibit design and interior design , to schools that almost completely subordinated aesthetic design to concerns of usage and ergonomics , the so-called functionalist school 249 except for certain functional areas of overlap between industrial design and engineering design , the former is considered an applied art while the latter is an applied science relevant programs include graphic design , interior design , industrial design , architectural technology , and drafting diplomas and degrees in industrial design are offered at vocational schools and universities worldwide generally , industrial design professionals work in small scale design , rather than overall design of complex systems such as buildings or ships
