the premiere edition included as its mission statement the following : '' the fulcrum is dedicated entirely to the interests of our students of today and yesterday the inclusion of advertising starting in its second year allowed the paper some slight financial freedom and the fulcrum continued in this manner until 1946 , when it came under the supervision of the english students ' association and the sfuo the proposal was rejected , but operations at the two papers were condensed into one workspace in the house the sfuo occupied at the time the fulcrum spoke out on the issue and in an editorial at the time stated that : '' we feel that the administration should have given the publishers of la rotonde a chance to act the publishers ( the students ' union ) are the ones who should have the right to confiscate an issue of a student newspaper , or any part thereof '' the official reason for the cancellation of the fulcrum and la rotonde and the subsequent launch of id was a lack of student interest in both newspapers ; however , it was during this time that canada was enveloped in the polarizing events of the october crisis , and many attribute the climate on campus and cancellation of the opposing-language newspapers to these events the relationship between the university administration and both newspapers gradually became more distant during this time , and ( as the publisher of both papers ) the sfuo began to step in to moderate and control content when the sfuo felt it was needed fueled by their lack of control over their publication and an increasing move towards autonomy in student newspapers across the country , editors at the fulcrum began formulating plans to go '' autonomous '' as early as 1998 , but many stalled attempts meant that they were not successful until many years later beginning in the 2003-2004 school year , the paper began referring to itself as university of ottawa 's fulcrum , rather than the fulcrum , on the cover the main reason being that the editorial board felt it was an inherent conflict of interest to be owned by the student government while attempting to write fair , unbiased , and often critical stories about them in october 2004 , a letters patent was granted to '' the fulcrum publishing society '' , the corporation that would take over the governance of the fulcrum , and negotiations between the sfuo and the fulcrum continued throughout the year recent changes to the governance structures of the corporation have led to slight changes , such as the business ( now general ) manager no longer being permitted to hold a seat on the board , and the roles of the corporation 's executives being clarified however , the 2008 agm saw a group of students mobilize to try to create an ad boycott for the purpose of stopping recruitment ads for the canadian forces being run by the department of national defence , which those students found objectionable
