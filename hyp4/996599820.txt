michael penman , robert the bruce , king of the scots his date of birth is unknown , but it was probably not very long after robert was born in 1274 ; he was old enough to be fighting in 1307 and to be given an independent command not long after edward fought alongside robert throughout his struggle for the scottish throne , including his desperate period on the run and as a guerrilla it was he who made a possibly ill-judged pact with the english governor of stirling castle , which led to the english sending a large army to relieve the castle this became critical when the isle of man was recaptured by english-backed scots from king robert 's control in january 1315 , thereby threatening the south and south-west of scotland and also reopening up a potential source of aid to the english from the anglo-irish and native irish ó néill had been troubled by anglo-irish incursions to the south-east ( the de verdons ) , the east ( tenants of the earl of ulster ) and west ( also by the earl of ulster ) of tír eógain and in order to retain his lands , he and some twelve of his vassals and allies jointly asked for aid from scotland the bruce brothers agreed , on condition that they would support edward as king of ireland , as the brothers envisaged themselves as separate rulers of scotland and ireland , while robert would regain man and edward possibly making an attack on wales , with welsh support at about this point , roger mortimer , 1st earl of march , received news from irish sources that an invasion was about to take place , and made his way to ireland where he held land , mainly in and around the castle and town of trim he had previously fought against the bruces at bannockburn where he was taken prisoner and freed to return king edward ii 's royal seal , lost in the rout subsequently , the scots managed to take the town , though not the castle , of carrickfergus the irish annals state that de brus '' took the hostages and lordship of the whole province of ulster without opposition and they consented to him being proclaimed king of ireland and all the gaels of ireland agreed to grant him lordship and they called him king of ireland worse was to follow : de burgh found himself deprived of not two but three allies and their armies when his kinsman , walter mac walter cattach burke deserted back to connacht at the head of several hundred men , probably to guard his own estates from the upcoming conflict thus when in august edward and his men crossed the bann in four ships supplied by scots sea captain , thomas dun , de burgh retreated still further to connor , where on either the first or ninth of september a charge by the scots-irish led to his defeat on 13 november , edward marched further south via dundalk where , incredibly , '' some gave them the right hand '' ( a fight ) , occupied nobber on the 30th , and advanced to kells , where he was met by mortimer at the same time , governor of ireland ( and bishop of ely ) john hotham began to take drastic action to defend dublin from de brus , such as leveling entire tenements and churches the only manors left alone belonged to irish lords intimidated to join him , or that of a junior branch of the de lacy family who in an effort to gain lands voluntarily joined him shortly king robert returned to scotland and management of his own kingdom , but promised more aid and more volunteers to help his brother edward was killed , his body being quartered and sent to various towns in ireland , and his head being delivered to king edward ii the annals of ulster ( erroneously under the year 1315 ) summed up the hostile feeling held by many among the anglo-irish and irish alike of edward de brus : '' edward de brus , the destroyer of ireland in general , both foreigners and gaels , was killed by the foreigners of ireland by dint of fighting at dun-delgan edward bruce created havoc in the colonised parts of ireland , and might be said to have nearly brought the settlement to its knees but despite this , he failed in the end , and with him the attempt to create a kingdom of ireland and drive out the settlers ceased however , he succeeded in preventing aid for the conquest of scotland arriving from ireland which was probably the main purpose of the invasion so while everywhere the gaelic recovery of lost territories was remarkable , there was never any serious attempt made to unite gaelic ireland or to bring about the downfall of the english government in ireland and the end of the colony
