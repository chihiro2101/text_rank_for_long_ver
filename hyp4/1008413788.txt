during the european colonialism , encyclopedias often sought to give a rationale for the predominance of european rule during the colonial period by referring to a special position taken by europe compared to the other continents the brockhaus enzyklopädie ( conversations-lexicon ) of 1847 still has an ostensibly eurocentric approach and claims about europe that '' its geographical situation and its cultural and political significance is clearly the most important of the five continents , over which it has gained a most influential government both in material and even more so in cultural aspects '' the european miracle , a term coined by eric jones in 1981 , refers to this surprising rise of europe during the early modern period during the 15th to 18th centuries , a great divergence took place , comprising the european renaissance , age of discovery , the formation of the colonial empires , the age of reason , and the associated leap forward in technology and the development of capitalism and early industrialisation china replaced the real historically development with a fixed , stable scenario , which makes it the outsider of world history some scholars disagree with his ideas that the oriental countries were outside of world history in the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism , he wrote that the '' rational '' capitalism manifested by its enterprises and mechanisms only appear in the protestant western countries , and a series of generalized and universal cultural phenomena only appear in the west even the state , with a written constitution and a government organized by trained administrators and constrained by rational law , only appear in the west , even though other regimes can also comprise states even in the 19th century , anticolonial movements had developed claims about national traditions and values that were set against those of europe in africa and india in some cases , as china , where local ideology was even more exclusionist than the eurocentric one , westernisation did not overwhelm longstanding chinese attitudes to its own cultural centrality , but some would state that idea itself is a rather desperate attempt to cast europe in a good light by comparison cambridge history of china , cup,1988 orientalism developed in the late 18th century as a disproportionate western interest in and idealization of eastern ( i.e brohman ( 1995 ) argued that eurocentrism '' perpetuated intellectual dependence on a restricted group of prestigious western academic institutions that determine the subject matter and methods of research '' in treatises on historical or contemporary eurocentrism that appeared since the 1990s , eurocentrism is mostly cast in terms of dualisms such as civilized/barbaric or advanced/backward , developed/undeveloped , core/periphery , implying '' evolutionary schemas through which societies inevitably progress '' , with a remnant of an '' underlying presumption of a superior white western self as referent of analysis '' ( 640 eurocentrism and the dualistic properties that it labels on non-european countries , cultures and persons have often been criticized in the political discourse of the 1990s and 2000s , particularly in the greater context of political correctness , race in the united states and affirmative action crashcourse '' eurocentrism '' ( 2012 ) : loewen , james '' lies my teacher told me '' ( 1995 ) in the 1990s , there was a trend of criticizing various geographic terms current in the english language as eurocentric , such as the traditional division of eurasia into europe and asia martin lewis and kären wigen in their book , the myth of continents ( 1997 ) : '' in physical , cultural and historical diversity , china and india are comparable to the entire european landmass , not to a single european country please quote or refer only to the published article '' ) '' the expression middle east is an old british label based on a british western perception of the east divided into middle or near and far '' eric sheppard , in 2005 , argued that contemporary marxism itself has eurocentric traits ( in spite of '' eurocentrism '' originating in the vocabulary of marxian economics ) , because it supposes that the third world must go through a stage of capitalism before '' progressive social formations can be envisioned '' he criticized some western scholars for their ideas that non-western areas lack outstanding contributions in history , economy , ideology , politics and culture compared with the west these scholars believed that the same contribution made by the west gives westerners an advantage of endo-genetic momentum which is pushed towards the rest of the world , but frank believed that the oriental countries also contributed to the human civilization in their own perspectives there has been some debate on whether historical eurocentrism qualifies as '' just another ethnocentrism '' , as it is found in most of the world 's cultures , especially in cultures with imperial aspirations , as in the sinocentrism in china ; in the empire of japan ( c ( 2000 ) , eight eurocentric historians , guilford press , new york indigenous philosophies have been noted to greatly contrast with eurocentric thought eurocentrism have come to play a role in the 2000s to 2010s in the context of the political discourse on race in the united states and critical whiteness studies , aiming to expose white supremacism and white privilege however , on the whole , philosophy as a discipline has remained relatively untouched by interdisciplinary work on race and whiteness on the other hand , in an article , 'eurocentrism and academic imperialism ' by professor seyed mohammad marandi , from the university of tehran , states that eurocentric thought exists in almost all aspects of academia in many parts of the world , especially in the humanities this occurred through the application of new criteria meant to '' impose a new social classification of the world population on a global scale '' and therefore , europe or western europe emerged as the central place of new patterns and capitalist power according to alexander edmond 's book pretty modern : beauty , sex , and plastic surgery in brazil , whiteness plays a role in latin american , specifically brazilian , beauty standards , but it is not necessarily distinguished based on skin color eurocentrism 's effect on the islamic world has predominantly come from a fundamental statement of preventing the account of lower-level explanation and account of islamic cultures and their social evolution , mainly through eurocentrism 's idealist construct this construct has gained power from the historians revolving their conclusions around the idea of a central point that favors the notion that the evolution of societies and their progress are dictated by general tendencies , leading to the islamic world 's evolution becoming more of a philosophical topic of history instead of historical fact stemming from eurocentrism 's innate bias towards western civilization came the creation of the concept of the '' european society , '' which favored the components ( mainly christianity ) of european civilization and allowed eurocentrists to brand diverging societies and cultures as '' uncivilized '' prevalent during the nineteenth century , the labeling of uncivilized in the eyes of eurocentrists enabled western countries to classify non-european and non-white countries as inferior , and limit their inclusion and contribution in actions like international law this exclusion was seen as acceptable by individuals like john westlake , a professor of international law at the university of cambridge at the time , who commented that countries with european civilizations should be who comprises the international society , and that countries like turkey and persia should only be allowed a part of international law the figurative superiority resulting from the rise of '' european civilization '' and the labels of '' civilized '' and '' uncivilized '' are partly responsible for eurocentrism 's denial of islamic social evolution , giving westerners the advantage of an early dismissal of such ideas regarding oriental civilizations through comparisons to the west eurocentrism 's reach has not only affected the perception of the cultures and civilizations of the islamic world , but also the aspects and ideas of orientalism , a cultural idea that distinguished the '' orient '' of the east from the '' occident '' western societies of europe and north america , and which was originally created so that the social and cultural milestones of the islamic and oriental world would be recognized '' along with this shift came the creation of two types of orientalism : latent , which covered the orient 's constant durability through history , and manifest , a more dynamic orientalism that changes with the new discovery of information with those wanting to represent the eurocentric ideals better by way of orientalism , there came a barrier of languages , being arabic , persian , and other similar languages with more researchers wanting to study more of orientalism , there was an assumption made about the languages of the islamic world : that having the ability to transcribe the texts of the past islamic world would give great knowledge and insight on oriental studies this reasoning came as the belief at the time was that other studies like anthropology and sociology were deemed irrelevant as they did not believe it misleading to this portion of mankind through this action , eurocentric researchers ' understanding of oriental and islamic culture was intentionally left undermined , foregoing the reasoning behind the actions and reasoning for the changes in culture documented by islamic and oriental texts and allowing for further possible western influence on orientalism , and increasing the difficulty of identifying what is truly oriental and what is considered oriental by the west the beauty standard has become westernized and has influenced people throughout the globe but she said that the tests did reflect a negative portrayal of black dolls in american theater and media that dates back to the civil war era.thus , bernstein said , the choices made by the subjects of the clark doll tests was not necessarily an indication of black self-hatred instead , it was a cultural choice between two different toys—one that was to be loved and one that was to be physically harassed , as exemplified in performance and popular media the people who carried out the study noted that eurocentrism is deeply rooted in different cultures , including latin cultures
