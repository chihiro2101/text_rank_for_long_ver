according to one source , '' the enabling legislation for the naca slipped through almost unnoticed as a rider attached to the naval appropriation bill , on march 3 , 1915 by the early 1920s , it had adopted a new and more ambitious mission : to promote military and civilian aviation through applied research that looked beyond current needs when engineers at a major engine manufacturer were having issues producing superchargers that would allow the boeing b-17 flying fortress to maintain power at high altitude , a team of engineers from naca solved the problems and created the standards and testing methods used to produce effective superchargers in the future this enabled the b-17 to be used as a key aircraft in the war effort the designs and information gained from naca research on the b-17 were used in nearly every major u.s nearly every aircraft used some form of forced induction that relied on information developed by naca the offered p-40 tomahawk fighters were considered too outdated to be a feasible front line fighter by european standards , and so north american began development of a new aircraft the british government chose a naca-developed airfoil for the fighter , which enabled it to perform dramatically better than previous models although the bell x-1 was commissioned by the air force and flown by air force test pilot chuck yeager , when it exceeded mach 1 naca was officially in charge of the testing and development of the aircraft compressibility is a major issue as aircraft approach mach 1 , and research into solving the problem drew heavily on information collected during previous naca wind tunnel testing to assist lockheed with the p-38 lightning the x-1 program was first envisioned in 1944 when a former naca engineer working for bell aircraft was previously head of the high speed wind tunnel division , which itself had nearly a decade of high speed test data by that time from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , 1998 , p.89 in 1951 , naca engineer richard whitcomb determined the area rule that explained transonic flow over an aircraft from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy p.147 the most important design resulting from the area rule was the b-58 hustler , which was already in development at the time from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , 1998 , p.147 this was the first us supersonic bomber , and was capable of mach 2 at a time when soviet fighters had only just attained that speed months earlier naca experience provided a powerful model for world war ii research , the postwar government laboratories , and naca 's successor , the nasa ( nasa ) naca also participated in development of the first aircraft to fly to the '' edge of space '' , north american 's x-15
