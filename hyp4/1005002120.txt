being italian he had the right to be tried by a jury of half foreigners , which he refused , as we read from the first lines of the proceedings , so that he was normally tried by a jury of englishmen , thus demonstrating intentionally his regard towards the english justice it is necessary to consider that most information about the trial come from the proceedings , a publication which from 1664 to 1913 took note and told all ( or at least most ) of the trials which took place at the old bailey following her own account , in the evening on 6 october 1769 , between nine and ten , she was sitting down on a step together with another woman in the haymarket , when the other woman approached baretti , who was passing through there , and ward said she thought the other woman had touched him one of them asked baretti how he could strike a woman and then a scuffle followed , baretti ending up on the ground she was asked also more and more details , for example where the other woman put her hands when grabbing baretti , and she answered she put them towards his private parts tales from the hanging court , london : hodder education she added she did not know the three men who arrived , but that she remembered having kissed one of them ( namely clark ) the night before the second person to testify was thomas patman , one of the three men who came up at the haymarket he told the court he was with the other two men that evening , they had been drinking together and then decided to go to golden square , but when they were in the haymarket they saw a gentleman , meaning baretti , striking elisabeth ward crime and justice â€“ policing in london , old bailey proceedings online ( www.oldbaileyonline.org , version 7.0 , 10 december 2015 ) lambert said he was having dinner that night when he heard the cry of '' murderer '' or '' stop murderer '' and saw a man pursued by other two or three going into the grocer 's shop opposite his house he then said he thought of carrying baretti to the round-house , but hearing the name of john fielding baretti expressed his will to go to him he added that he himself also tried to find the other prostitute at the haymarket responsible for having importuned baretti , but could not however , it is not clear who did this , it could have been baretti himself , the judge or even a lawyer shoemaker pointed out that prosecution lawyers first appeared at the old bailey in around the 1730s , followed almost immediately by lawyers for the defence , so by the time baretti was prosecuted there might have been one of them present in the court after having heard different versions of the facts of the prosecution testimonies , the court let baretti defend himself and he took the chance to read a text he had previously prepared and written in his defence he also said there might have been two women , as other testimonies claimed , but he only saw one : '' they say there were two , but i took notice of but one , as i hope god will save me : there might have been two , though i only saw one : that is a fact '' therefore , he stroke her hand and the woman insulted him for being a foreigner , he said '' she called me several bad names having concluded his own account of the facts , baretti turned to the jury saying '' i hope your lordship , and every person present , will think that a man of my age , character and way of life , would not spontaneously quit my pen , to engage in an outrageous insult '' and finally he explained his short-sight as a possible cause for not having seen the other woman moreover , he explained his refusal to be tried by a jury of half foreigners , saying that he did for his life and for his honour , '' i chose to be tried by a jury of this country ; for if my honour is not saved , i can not much wish for the preservation of my life '' in this way he concluded his speech , showing he trusted england 's law system and with the confidence that he would have been acquitted , as he believed he had the right to she was apparently the only eye-witness testifying in the trial and said she was in panton street with her child when she saw a group of people at the end of the street by the haymarket and said she '' saw a gentleman run from among them on the side of the way i was in the evening '' because of the indecent women you could find there and kelnynge said that a similar episode happened to him as well before joshua reynolds said he was a man with great humanity and '' very active in endeavouring his friends '' , he outlined his sober disposition , saying that he never drank more than three glasses with him and he added : '' i never heard of his being in passions or quarreling '' as we read from the proceedings there were other several gentlemen who were there to testify for baretti 's good character , but the court did not think it necessary to call them all this trial is reported in hitchcock and shoemaker 's book tales from the hanging court as an example of how important were testimonies of friends and neighbours , who could assert for the good character of the accused baretti was extremely satisfied with the outcome of the trial , in particular with the kind demonstration of affection he received from his friends , so much that he felt himself even more connected with england than before , a country which had given him justice and real friendship he later revealed to his friend lord charlemont that '' those i had about me did their part so well that they have made me an englishman forever ''
