according to the current model of atp synthesis ( known as the alternating catalytic model ) , the transmembrane potential created by ( h+ ) proton cations supplied by the electron transport chain , drives the ( h+ ) proton cations from the intermembrane space through the membrane via the f o region of atp synthase the c-ring is tightly attached to the asymmetric central stalk ( consisting primarily of the gamma subunit ) , causing it to rotate within the alpha 3 beta 3 of f 1 causing the 3 catalytic nucleotide binding sites to go through a series of conformational changes that lead to atp synthesis the structure of the intact atp synthase is currently known at low-resolution from electron cryo-microscopy ( cryo-em ) studies of the complex the binding change mechanism involves the active site of a β subunit 's cycling between three states the enzyme then undergoes a change in shape and forces these molecules together , with the active site in the resulting '' tight '' state ( shown in red ) binding the newly produced atp molecule with very high affinity in respiring bacteria under physiological conditions , atp synthase , in general , runs in the opposite direction , creating atp while using the proton motive force created by the electron transfer chain as a source of energy the evolution of atp synthase is thought to have been modular whereby two functionally independent subunits became associated and gained new functionality the f 1 region also shows significant similarity to hexameric dna helicases ( especially the rho factor ) , and the entire enzyme region shows some similarity to -powered t3ss or flagellum complexes both have roles dependent on the relative rotation of a macromolecule within the pore ; the dna helicases use the helical shape of dna to drive their motion along the dna molecule and to detect supercoiling , whereas the α 3 β 3 hexamer uses the conformational changes through the rotation of the γ subunit to drive an enzymatic reaction this link is tenuous , however , as the overall structure of flagellar motors is far more complex than that of the f o particle and the ring with about 30 rotating proteins is far larger than the 10 , 11 , or 14 helical proteins in the f o complex the modular evolution theory for the origin of atp synthase suggests that two subunits with independent function , a dna helicase with atpase activity and a motor , were able to bind , and the rotation of the motor drove the atpase activity of the helicase in reverse the enzyme is integrated into thylakoid membrane ; the cf 1 -part sticks into stroma , where dark reactions of photosynthesis ( also called the light-independent reactions or the calvin cycle ) and atp synthesis take place
