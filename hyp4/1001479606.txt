metamathematical metatheorems about mathematics itself were originally differentiated from ordinary mathematical theorems in the 19th century to focus on what was then called the foundational crisis of mathematics more recently , mathematical logic has often included the study of new pure mathematics , such as set theory , category theory , recursion theory and pure model theory , which is not directly related to metamathematics in his hands , it meant something akin to contemporary proof theory , in which finitary methods are used to study various axiomatized mathematical theorems ( kleene 1952 , p before its discovery there was just one geometry and mathematics ; the idea that another geometry existed was considered improbable '' frege 's motivation for developing his formal approach to logic resembled leibniz 's motivation for his calculus ratiocinator ( despite that , in his foreword frege clearly denies that he reached this aim , and also that his main aim would be constructing an ideal language like leibniz 's , what frege declares to be quite hard and idealistic , however , not impossible task ) principia mathematica , or '' pm '' as it is often abbreviated , was an attempt to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven however , in 1931 , gödel 's incompleteness theorem proved definitively that pm , and in fact any other attempt , could never achieve this lofty goal ; that is , for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics , there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them contemporary mathematics , however , avoids paradoxes such as russell 's in less unwieldy ways , such as the system of zermelo–fraenkel set theory the two results are widely , but not universally , interpreted as showing that hilbert 's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible , giving a negative answer to hilbert 's second problem t-theories form the basis of much fundamental work in philosophical logic , where they are applied in several important controversies in analytic philosophy
