in a paper presented to the first international congress of linguists in 1928 , he used a german calque of this term , sprachbund , defining it as a group of languages with similarities in syntax , morphological structure , cultural vocabulary and sound systems , but without systematic sound correspondences , shared basic morphology or shared basic vocabulary standard average european ( sae ) is a concept introduced in 1939 by benjamin whorf to group the modern indo-european languages of europe with shared common features the work began to assume the character of a comparison between hopi and western european languages it also became evident that even the grammar of hopi bore a relation to hopi culture , and the grammar of european tongues to our own '' western '' or '' european '' culture '' since , with respect to the traits compared , there is little difference between english , french , german , or other european languages with the 'possible ' ( but doubtful ) exception of balto-slavic and non-indo-european , i have lumped these languages into one group called sae , or '' standard average european whorf argued that these languages were characterized by a number of similarities including syntax and grammar , vocabulary and its use as well as the relationship between contrasting words and their origins , idioms and word order which all made them stand out from many other language groups around the world which do not share these similarities ; in essence creating a continental sprachbund the standard average european sprachbund is most likely the result of ongoing language contact in the time of the migration period '' language typology and language universals '' accessed 2015-10-13 and later , continuing during the middle ages and the renaissance the same features are not found in other languages that are otherwise closely related , such as the other romance languages in relation to romanian , and the other slavic languages such as polish in relation to bulgaro-macedonian in the paper , emeneau observed that the subcontinent 's dravidian and indo-aryan languages shared a number of features that were not inherited from a common source , but were areal features , the result of diffusion during sustained contact emeneau specified the tools to establish that language and culture had fused for centuries on the indian soil to produce an integrated mosaic of structural convergence of four distinct language families : indo-aryan , dravidian , munda and tibeto-burman the mainland southeast asia linguistic area is one of the most dramatic of linguistic areas in terms of the surface similarity of the languages involved , to the extent that early linguists tended to group them all into a single family , although the modern consensus places them into numerous unrelated families these parallels led to confusion over the classification of these languages , until andré-georges haudricourt showed in 1954 that tone was not an invariant feature , by demonstrating that vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other languages of the mon–khmer family , and proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin
