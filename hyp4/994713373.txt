more specifically , these isoprenoid groups , usually farnesyl ( 15-carbon ) and geranylgeranyl ( 20-carbon ) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the c terminal of the protein this dynamic interaction of prenylated proteins with the cell membrane is important for their signalling functions and is often deregulated in disease processes such as cancer more specifically , ras is the protein that undergoes prenylation via farnesyltransferase and when it is switched on it can turn on genes involved in cell growth and differentiation proteins can be modified to contain either one or both of these fatty acids attachment of myristic acid ) is generally an irreversible protein modification that typically occurs during protein synthesis in which the myrisitc acid is attached to the Î±-amino group of an n-terminal glycine residue through an amide linkage proteins that have been myristoylated are involved in signal transduction cascade , protein-protein interactions and in mechanisms that regulate protein targeting and function palmitoylated proteins are mainly found on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane where they play a role in transmembrane signaling it is believed that this reverse palmitoylation may regulate the interaction of the protein with the membrane and thus have a role in signaling processes an example in which palmitoylation of a protein plays a role in cell signaling pathways is in the clustering of proteins in the synapse glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins ( gpi-anchored proteins ) are attached to a gpi complex molecular group via an amide linkage to the protein 's c-terminus carboxyl group this great diversity is what allows the gpi proteins to have a wide range of functions including acting as hydrolytic enzymes , adhesion molecule , receptors , protease inhibitor and complement regulatory proteins
