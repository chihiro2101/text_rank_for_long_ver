while at michigan , his official academic interest was human relations ; however , he had many other intellectual hobbies , such as reading russian novels however , during his time at michigan , he remembers being heavily involved in global events occurring at the time moreover , ritzer also found problems within the management structure at ford ritzer said , '' i 'd like to see a society in which people are free to be creative , rather than having their creativity constrained or eliminated '' furthermore , he found himself constrained and unable to do anything creative while working at ford , encouraging him to apply to ph.d as a testament to his interest and dedication to the subject , he received an a+ on a 102-page paper he wrote for a course on american society this experience as well as out-reading the other sociology students in a small seminar with margaret cussler allowed ritzer to become more confident as a sociology student due to his ability to outwork the competition '' despite this challenge , ritzer found that not being trained in social theory was actually advantageous for him , simply because his reasoning was not limited to a particular theoretical perspective listed are his biggest accomplishments in social theory : weber famously used the terminology '' iron cage '' to describe the stultifying , kafkaesque effects of bureaucratized life , and ritzer applied this idea to an influential social system in the twenty-first century : mcdonald 's ritzer argues that mcdonald 's restaurants have become the better example of current forms of instrumental rationality and its ultimately irrational and harmful consequences on people ritzer , g the '' mcdonald 's model '' is influential in this conception due to providing a lot of food for not that much money also , calculability leads to the idea that the longer the resume or list of degrees , the better the candidate , during an application process the control aspect of mcdonaldization has extended to other businesses , sylvan learning and phone operating systems , and even birth and death many '' mcdonald 's '' aspects of society are beneficial to the advancement and enhancement of human life in addition to the mcdonaldization of society , the most important sources for ritzer ’ s sociology of consumption are his edited explorations in the sociology of consumption : fast food restaurants , credit cards and casinos ( 2001 ) , enchanting a disenchanted world : revolutionizing the means of consumption ( 2nd edition 2005 , 3rd edition 2009 ) , and expressing america : a critique of the global credit-card society ( 1995 ) it has only recently become popularly acknowledged that the existence of prosumption as activities on the internet and web 2.0 resemble prosumption much more so than production or consumption individually according to ritzer , '' something '' is a locally conceived and controlled social form that is comparatively rich in distinctive substantive content the globalization of nothing , pine forge press , thousand oaks , 2004 , this book presents a sophisticated argument about the nature of globalization in terms of the consumption of goods and services '' nothing '' plays a large part in understanding ritzer 's globalization , one instance of nothing again and again- dominates social life ( ritzer , george to better understand globalization , it can be broken down into a few characteristics : the beginning of global communication through different media like television and the internet the formation of a '' global consciousness '' in addition to the globalization of nothing , ritzer has edited the blackwell companion to globalization ( 2007 ) , written globalization : a basic text ( 2009 ) , and edited an encyclopedia of globalization ( forthcoming ) insight into ritzer 's distinctive approach to globalization is available via a special review symposium in the sage journal thesis eleven ( number 76 , february 2004 ) xiii grobalization , a term coined by ritzer himself , refers to '' imperialistic ambitions of nations , corporations , organizations , and the like and their desire , indeed need , to impose themselves on various geographic areas '' p.175 students , rather than evaluating the competing ideas , instead absorb the information given to them the local individuals are able to manipulate their own situation in the world and become creative agents in what products and services are represented in their local environment within the glocalized world through the application of the three subsets of metatheory , ritzer argues that the field of sociology can create a stronger foundation , experience '' rapid and dramatic growth '' , and generally increase not only the knowledge of metatheory but social theory in general the internal-intellectual sector of m u identifies the '' schools of thought '' and the structure of current sociologists and social theories the third subtype of m u is the external-intellectual view of sociology ; it looks at different studies and their concepts , tools , and ideas in order to apply these aspects to sociology the fourth , and final , subset is external-social where the impact of social theory in a larger societal setting is studied new social theory is created due to the complex study and interpretation of other sociologists for convenient access to many of ritzer 's substantive contributions to modern and postmodern social theorizing , see explorations in social theory : from metatheorizing to rationalization ( 2001 ) as well as more recent work often co-authored with his many students , such as ( with j michael ryan ) '' postmodern social theory and sociology : on symbolic exchange with a ‘ dead ’ theory , '' in reconstructing postmodernism : critical debates ( 2007 ) in this book , ritzer contends that sociology needs an integrated paradigm in order to add to the extant paradigms noted in sociology : a multiple paradigm science in this provocative book , george ritzer explores how weber 's classic thoughts on rationalization take on new vitality and meaning when applied to the process of mcdonaldization he describes this as the process by which the principles of the fast food restaurants are coming to dominate more and more sectors of society in the united states as well as the rest of the world ritzer shows how weber 's central characteristics of rationalized systems - efficiency , predictability , calculability , substitution of non-human for human technology and control over uncertainty - have found widespread expression in a broad range of organized human activity , including travel , consumer products and services , education , leisure , politics and religion as well as in the fast food industry during the introduction of this book , ritzer writes , “ although any list of theorists covered in a collection such as this one can be read as an official cannon , this book is intended to be used as ‘ cannon fodder ’ in an open , contestable process of theory construction and reconstruction by linking theory to 21st-century culture , this book resonates with audiences in a way that few other books do , opening their eyes to many current issues , especially in consumption and globalization the biggest change , however , is that the book has been streamlined to offer an even clearer articulation of the mcdonaldization thesis as before , this book is structured around four sets of concepts addressing the issues of : '' places/non-places , '' '' things/non-things , '' '' people/non-people , '' and '' services/non-services the current edition features a greater emphasis on the main topic of globalization : a new first chapter offers an introductory overview of globalization and globalization theory , outlining the unique ways in which these topics are addressed throughout the text it also delves into two subprocesses of globalization — '' glocalization '' and '' grobalization ritzer continues to explore this book 's central thesis : that our society has undergone fundamental change because of the way and the level at which we consume the third edition demonstrates how we have created new '' cathedrals '' of consumption ( places that enchant us so as to entice us to stay longer and consume more ) while continuing to take capitalism to a new level the book also includes a wide range of theoretical perspectives — marxian , weberian , critical theory , postmodern theory — as well as a number of concepts such as hyperconsumption , implosion , simulation , and time and space to show the audience how sociological theory can be applied to everyday phenomena
