mesmes had a large library for the period ( about 8,000 volumes ) and it was open to scholars who had the appropriate references naudé 's service in mesme 's library would give him experience which he would use later to write the book advice on establishing a library like naudé , he believed in an open library to be used by the public for the public good the fastest way was to absorb entire libraries into the collection , advice that naudé included in his book naudé , in his career as a librarian , “ opposed censorship , and encouraged library owners to allow others to use their books , a practice he considered a great honor for the owner – an honor equal to that of having the opportunity to build a fine library having bought up in every last one of them all the books , whether in manuscript or in print , dealing in any language whatever with any subject or division of learning no matter what , he has left the stores stripped and bare it became the first public library in france because of naudé ’ s insistence and was open to the public as early as 1644 advice , written as a set of instructions for a private collector and was based on naudé 's own experience and research in the introduction of his book , naudé wrote that he is not an expert in the field of librarianship but he presented what he believed to be the most important ideas he based some of the opinions in advice on his own experience in mesme 's library , and wrote out for mesme the accepted practices and principles of librarians of the time naudé 's first chapter poses the question , '' why establish a library ?
