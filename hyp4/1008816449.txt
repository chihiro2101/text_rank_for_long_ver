in 1924 , the committee of imperial defence set up a subcommittee to look at what measure could be taken to protect the civil population from aerial attack for the next ten years this committee looked into issues of new aerial weapons development and the possible impact on civilians the use of gas attacks in the first world war played heavy on the decisions and protection via gas masks was a core decision taken by the committee together with ideas around the building of air raid shelters , evacuations of people and blackout requirements these were all termed passive air defence this department replaced the earlier subcommittees and took overall control of the british response to passive air defence in april 1937 , the air raid wardens ' service was created which aimed to seek some 800,000 volunteers ( some 200,000 people had joined by mid-1938 , and following the munich crisis of september 1938 another 500,000 had enrolled ) wardens gave arp advice to the public and were responsible for reporting bombs and other incidents , and were joined by the royal voluntary service in may 1938 on 1 january 1938 , the air raid precautions act came into force , compelling all local authorities to begin creating their own arp services often boy scouts or boys ' brigade members aged between 14 and 18 as messengers or runners would take verbal or written messages from air raid wardens and deliver them to either the sector post or the control centre the role of arp was open to both men and women but only men could serve in the gas contamination ( teams that dealt with chemical and gas bombs ) , heavy and light rescue and demolition services within metropolitan boroughs , the initial aim was to have one warden to every 500 residents ( this increased later ) , reporting from individual warden posts - each with its own post warden in cities , a warden post was responsible for a small area ( larger in rural areas ) with five wardens to every 4–5,000 people during the seven-month phoney war period following the outbreak of war in september 1939 , arp wardens mainly offered advice , issued gas masks and air raid shelters ( such as the external anderson and internal morrison shelter ) and enforced the blackout arp control centres would sound the air raid sirens and wardens would marshal people into the shelters and then watch out for the fall of any bombs within their sector – often done during air raids and therefore highly dangerous when the wardens came across the site of a bombing they would telephone for the emergency services , render first aid to victims with minor injuries and deal with small fires ( placing sand on incendiary devices ) these were often not made to the same level as issued to soldiers to reduce costs file : issue of gas masks to british civilians , 1940 hu103753.jpg issue of gas masks to british civilians , 1940 file : tea and buns are supplied by local air raid precautions ( arp ) workers to fellow arp workers and civilians in this basement shelter in south east london during 1940 d1623.jpg tea and buns are supplied by local arp workers to fellow workers and civilians in a basement shelter in south east london , 1940 file : air raid precautions , 1940 hu104525.jpg arp control room , nottingham , 1940 file : air raid precautions dog at work in poplar , london , england , 1941 d5945.jpg air raid precautions dog at work in poplar , london , england , 1941 file : air raid precautions , 1940 hu104542.jpg ambulance drivers knit and listen to a wireless while they await a call out to air raid incidents in 1940 file : air raid precautions and civil defence in wartime britain , 1942 d10588.jpg adjusting blackout curtains in 1943 file : air raid precautions in central london , england , uk , 1941 d3606.jpg encased equestrian statue of charles i in trafalgar square with a notice giving directions to the nearest public air raid shelter file : air raid precautions on the british home front- the work of the gas cleansing centre , wandsworth , london , england , 1941 d3919.jpg training exercise at a gas cleansing centre , wandsworth , london , england , 1941
