his future army reputation as a ladies ' man began in mexico , where local girls referred to him as the '' handsome captain '' timeline of hooker 's life , sonoma league he was obviously unhappy and unsuccessful in his civilian pursuits because , in 1858 , he wrote to secretary of war john b at the start of the civil war in 1861 , hooker requested a commission , but his first application was rejected , possibly because of the lingering resentment harbored by winfield scott , general-in-chief of the army after he witnessed the union army defeat at the first battle of bull run , he wrote a letter to president abraham lincoln that complained of military mismanagement , promoted his own qualifications , and again requested a commission in the peninsula campaign of 1862 , hooker commanded the 2nd division of the iii corps and made a good name for himself as a combat leader who handled himself well and aggressively sought out the key points on battlefields hooker 's division did not play a major role in the seven days battles , although he and fellow division commander phil kearny tried unsuccessfully to urge mcclellan to counterattack the confederates during the second battle of bull run , the iii corps was sent to reinforce john pope 's army of virginia during the maryland campaign , hooker led the i corps at south mountain and at antietam , his corps launched the first assault of the bloodiest day in american history , driving south into the corps of lt he asserted that the battle would have been a decisive union victory if he had managed to stay on the field , but general mcclellan 's caution once again failed the northern troops and lee 's much smaller army eluded destruction although hooker had criticized mcclellan persistently , the latter was apparently unaware of it and in early october , shortly before his termination , had recommended that hooker receive a promotion to brigadier general in the regular army during the '' mud march '' hooker was quoted by a new york times army correspondent as saying that '' nothing would go right until we had a dictator , and the sooner the better lincoln wrote a letter to the newly appointed general , part of which stated , during the spring of 1863 , hooker established a reputation as an outstanding administrator and restored the morale of his soldiers , which had plummeted to a new low under burnside other orders addressed the need to stem rising desertion ( one from lincoln combined with incoming mail review , the ability to shoot deserters , and better camp picket lines ) , more and better drills , stronger officer training , and for the first time , combining the federal cavalry into a single corps hooker said of his revived army : also during this winter hooker made several high-level command changes , including with his corps commanders ( both franklin and smith were considered suspect by hooker because of their previous political maneuvering against burnside and on behalf of mcclellan for the important position of chief of staff , hooker asked the war department to send him brig stone had been relieved , arrested , and imprisoned for his role in the battle of ball 's bluff in the fall of 1861 , despite the lack of any trial hooker never explained why he asked for stone , but catton believed : despite this , fighting joe would set a very bad example for the conduct of generals and their staffs and subordinates lee 's much smaller army at fredericksburg , while taking the large bulk of the army of the potomac on a flanking march to strike lee in his rear the flanking march went well enough , achieving strategic surprise , but when he attempted to advance with three columns , stonewall jackson 's surprise attack on may 1 pushed hooker back and caused him to withdraw his troops lee audaciously split his smaller army in two to deal with both parts of hooker 's army then , he split again , sending stonewall jackson 's corps on its own flanking march , striking hooker 's exposed right flank and routing the union xi corps lee once again began an invasion of the north , in june 1863 , and lincoln urged hooker to pursue and defeat him hooker 's initial plan was to seize richmond instead , but lincoln immediately vetoed that idea , so the army of the potomac began to march north , attempting to locate lee 's army of northern virginia as it slipped

competently in the 1864 atlanta campaign under sherman , but asked to be relieved before the capture of the city because of his dissatisfaction with the promotion of maj howard to command of the army of the tennessee , upon the death of maj not only did hooker have seniority over howard , but he also blamed howard in large part for his defeat at chancellorsville ( howard had commanded the xi corps , which had borne the brunt of jackson 's flank attack ) hooker 's biographer reports that there were numerous stories indicating that abraham lincoln attempted to intercede with sherman , urging that hooker be appointed to command the army of the tennessee , but sherman threatened to resign if the president insisted when a newspaper dispatch arrived in new york during the peninsula campaign , a
