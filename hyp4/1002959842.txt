le verrier 's most famous achievement is his prediction of the existence of the then unknown planet neptune , using only mathematics and astronomical observations of the known planet uranus encouraged by physicist arago , arago summary director of the paris observatory , le verrier was intensely engaged for months in complex calculations to explain small but systematic discrepancies between uranus 's observed orbit and the one predicted from the laws of gravity of newton at the same time , but unknown to le verrier , similar calculations were made by john couch adams in england le verrier announced his final predicted position for uranus 's unseen perturbing planet publicly to the french academy on 31 august 1846 , two days before adams 's final solution was privately mailed to the royal greenwich observatory adams 's work was begun earlier than le verrier 's but was finished later and was unrelated to the actual discovery not even the briefest account of adams 's predicted orbital elements was published until more than a month after berlin 's visual confirmation adams made full public acknowledgement of le verrier 's priority and credit ( not forgetting to mention the role of galle ) when he gave his paper to the royal astronomical society in november 1846 : le verrier published , in the annales de l'observatoire de paris , tables of the motions of all of the known planets , releasing them as he completed them , starting in 1858 about that time , le verrier 's work on the outer planets was revised and expanded by gaillot in 1859 , le verrier was the first to report that the slow precession of mercury â€™ s orbit around the sun could not be completely explained by newtonian mechanics and perturbations by the known planets 383 in the same volume le verrier 's report is followed by another , from faye , enthusiastically recommending to astronomers to search for a previously undetected intra-mercurial object
