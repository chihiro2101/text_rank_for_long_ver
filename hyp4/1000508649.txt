'' over production and under consumption '' , scarlett , history of economic theory and thought prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles , blamed them on external factors , notably war , or only studied the long term sismondi and his contemporary robert owen , who expressed similar but less systematic thoughts in 1817 report to the committee of the association for the relief of the manufacturing poor , both identified the cause of economic cycles as overproduction and underconsumption , caused in particular by wealth inequality in the 20th century , schumpeter and others proposed a typology of business cycles according to their periodicity , so that a number of particular cycles were named after their discoverers or proposers : the kitchin cycle of 3 to 5 years ( after joseph kitchin ) the juglar fixed investment cycle of 7 to 11 years ( often identified as '' the '' business cycle the kuznets swing of 15 to 25 years ( after simon kuznets – also called '' building cycle '' ) the kondratiev wave or long technological cycle of 45 to 60 years ( after the soviet economist nikolai kondratiev ) some say interest in the different typologies of cycles has waned since the development of modern macroeconomics , which gives little support to the idea of regular periodic cycles social contract ( freedoms and absence of social problems ) collapses may be observed in nations where incomes are not kept in balance with cost-of-living over the timeline of the monetary system cycle there were great increases in productivity , industrial production and real per capita product throughout the period from 1870 to 1890 that included the long depression and two other recessions there were also significant increases in productivity in the years leading up to the great depression over the period since the industrial revolution , technological progress has had a much larger effect on the economy than any fluctuations in credit or debt , the primary exception being the great depression , which caused a multi-year steep economic decline business cycles in oecd countries after world war ii were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles stock market cycles 1942–1995 economic stabilization policy using fiscal policy and monetary policy appeared to have dampened the worst excesses of business cycles , and automatic stabilization due to the aspects of the government 's budget also helped mitigate the cycle even without conscious action by policy-makers for several of these countries the period 1989–2010 has been an ongoing depression , with real income still lower than in 1989 the nber identifies a recession as '' a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months , normally visible in real gdp , real income , employment , industrial production '' there is often a close timing relationship between the upper turning points of the business cycle , commodity prices , and freight rates , which is shown to be particularly tight in the grand peak years of 1873 , 1889 , 1900 and 1912 numerous metrics are proposed to identify the business cycle , such as unemployment , stock market returns , and household spending rate series used to infer the underlying business cycle fall into three categories : lagging , coincident , and leading economists and investors alike speculate which series may lead the business cycle , providing advanced warning of changes and an advantage in information the business cycle follows changes in stock prices which are mostly caused by external factors such as socioeconomic conditions , inflation , exchange rates copied from wikipedia article intellectual capital the impact

number 2 in recent years economic theory has moved towards the study of economic fluctuation rather than a '' business cycle '' – though some economists use the phrase 'business cycle ' as a convenient shorthand friedman believed that for the most part , excluding very large supply shocks , business declines are more of a monetary phenomenon the explanation of fluctuations in aggregate economic activity is one of the primary concerns of macroeconomics and a variety of theories have been proposed to explain them these may also broadly be classed as '' supply-side '' and '' demand-side '' explanations : supply-side explanations may be styled , following say 's law , as arguing that '' supply creates its own demand '' , while demand-side explanations argue that effective demand may fall short of supply , yielding a recession or depression this division is not absolute – some classicals ( including say ) argued for government policy to mitigate the damage of economic cycles , despite believing in external causes , while austrian school economists argue against government involvement as only worsening crises , despite believing in internal causes the view of the economic cycle as caused exogenously dates to say 's law , and much debate on endogeneity or exogeneity of causes of the economic cycle is framed in terms of refuting or supporting say 's law ; this is also referred to as the '' general glut '' ( supply in relation to demand ) debate mainstream economists working in the neoclassical tradition , as opposed to the keynesian tradition , have usually viewed the departures of the harmonic working of the market economy as due to exogenous influences , such as the state or its regulations , labor unions , business monopolies , or shocks due to technology or natural causes in 1927 , eugen slutzky observed that summing random numbers , such as the last digits of the russian state lottery , could generate patterns akin to that we see in business cycles , an observation that has since been repeated many times this caused economists to move away from viewing business cycles as a cycle that needed to be explained and instead viewing their apparently cyclical nature as a methodological artefact mainstream economists have built models of business cycles based the idea that they are caused by random shocks according to keynesian economics , fluctuations in aggregate demand cause the economy to come to short run equilibrium at levels that are different from the full employment rate of output one alternative theory is that the primary cause of economic cycles is due to the credit cycle : the net expansion of credit ( increase in private credit , equivalently debt , as a percentage of gdp ) yields economic expansions , while the net contraction causes recessions , and if it persists , depressions while credit causes have not been a primary theory of the economic cycle within the mainstream , they have gained occasional mention , such as , cited approvingly by within mainstream economics , keynesian views have been challenged by real business cycle models in which fluctuations are due to random changes in the total productivity factor ( which are caused by changes in technology as well as the legal and regulatory environment ) . product based theory of economic cycles the theory originates from the work of raymond vernon , who described the development of international trade in terms of product life-cycle – a period of time during which the product circulates in the market recent research by georgiy revyakin proved initial vernon theory and showed economic cycles in developed countries overran economic cycles in developing countries highly competitive market conditions would determine simultaneous technological updates of all economic agents ( as a result , cycle formation ) : in case if a manufacturing technology at an enterprise does not meet the current technological environment , – such company loses its competitiveness and eventually goes bankrupt another set of models tries to derive the business cycle from political decisions in the heterodox marxian view , profit is the major engine of the market economy , but business ( capital ) profitability has a tendency to fall that recurrently creates crises in which mass unemployment occurs , businesses fail , remaining capital is centralized and concentrated and profitability is recovered goodwin formalised a marxist model of business cycles known as the goodwin model in which recession was caused by increased bargaining power of workers ( a result of high employment in boom periods ) pushing up the wage share of national income , suppressing profits and leading to a breakdown in capital accumulation later theorists applying variants of the goodwin model have identified both short and long period profit-led growth and distribution cycles in the united states and elsewhere 4 ( december 2006 ) : 452–465 david gordon provided a marxist model of long period institutional growth cycles in an attempt to explain the kondratiev wave one of the criticisms of the austrian business cycle theory is based on the observation that the united states suffered recurrent economic crises in the 19th century , notably the panic of 1873 , which occurred prior to the establishment of a u.s adherents of the austrian school , such as the historian thomas woods , argue that these earlier financial crises were prompted by government and bankers ' efforts to expand credit despite restraints imposed by the prevailing gold standard , and are thus consistent with austrian business cycle theory the austrian explanation of the business cycle differs significantly from the mainstream understanding of business cycles and is generally rejected by mainstream economists austrians claim that the boom-and-bust business cycle is caused by government intervention into the economy , and that the cycle would be comparatively rare and mild without central government interference their models show that when the difference between short-term interest rates ( they use 3-month t-bills ) and long-term interest rates ( 10-year treasury bonds ) at the end of a federal reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive that a rise in unemployment usually occurs estrella and others have postulated that the yield curve affects the business cycle via the balance sheet of banks ( or shadow banking system ) since the 1940s , following the keynesian revolution , most governments of developed nations have seen the mitigation of the business cycle as part of the responsibility of government , under the rubric of stabilization policy by contrast , some economists , notably new classical economics robert lucas , argue that the welfare cost of business cycles are very small to negligible , and that governments should focus on long-term growth instead of stabilization however , even according to keynesian theory , managing economic policy to smooth out the cycle is a difficult task in a society with a complex economy the crisis could also show up in a different form , for example as severe inflation or a steadily increasing deficit spending
