portland in the kingdom of wessex in south-west britain was attacked during the reign of king beorhtric of wessex ( ruled from 786 to 802 ) the ímar from whom the uí ímair were descended is generally presumed to be that ímar ( english pronunciation ivar ) : '' king of the northmen of all britain and ireland '' , whose death is reported by the annals of ulster in 873 see also woolf , pictland to alba , chapter 2 ; downham , viking kings , chapters 1 & ndash ; 3 , especially pp cyril hart 's contributions to the oxford dictionary of national biography make ragnall , sitriuc and gofraid brothers ; likewise hudson , viking pirates , p amlaíb 's father sitriuc first appears in the record in 917 when he seized dublin , a settlement which had probably been under the control of an irish king since the expulsion of the previous viking rulers in 902 the anglo-saxon chronicle records his marriage to king æthelstan 's sister at tamworth on 30 january 926 according to some late sources , such as the chronicler john of wallingford , amlaíb was the son of sitriuc and this west saxon princess according to william of malmesbury , who states that he did not know the princess 's name , she was æthelstan 's full sister , daughter of edward the elder and his first wife ecgwynn , john of wallingford gives her name as orgiue , perhaps eadgifu ; hudson , viking pirates , pp sitriuc 's other sons included gofraid ( died 951 ) , king of dublin , aralt ( died 940 ) , ruler of limerick , and , less certainly , sichfrith and auisle , listed among those killed at the battle of brunanburh in 937 by the annals of clonmacnoise following sitriuc 's death , amlaíb may have become king in york for a short time , thus keynes , '' rulers of the english '' , p but if he did it came to an end when æthelstan took over the kingdom of northumbria and defeated sitriuc 's brother gofraid according to william of malmesbury , amlaíb fled to ireland while his uncle gofraid made a second unsuccessful attempt to gain control of york in 937 an attack on æthelstan 's kingdom by gofraid 's son amlaíb , assisted by constantín mac áeda , the king of alba , and owen , the king of strathclyde , ended in defeat at the battle of brunanburh amlaíb mac gofrith , ruling in dublin , crossed to britain where he was accepted as king of the northumbrians this traditional view of amlaíb mac gofrith 's later career has recently been disputed by kevin halloran amlaíb cuarán 's career began in 941 , following the death of his cousin amlaíb mac gofrith , when he became co-ruler of york , sharing power with his cousin ragnall mac gofrith according to the annals of clonmacnoise , amlaíb had been in britain since 940 , having left another son of gofraid , blácaire , as ruler of dublin it appears that after æthelstan 's death , not only did edmund lose control of northumbria , but that the five burghs of the mercian danelaw also pledged themselves to amlaíb mac gofrith the events are associated with amlaíb mac gofrith by higham , kingdom of northumbria , p ragnall was baptised some time later according to the anglo-saxon chronicle the anglo-saxon chronicle reports that '' king edmund conquered all northumbria and caused to flee away two kings or '' royally-born men '' , olaf and rægnald '' after being driven out of northumbria , amlaíb returned to ireland while ragnall may have been killed at york the uí ímair in ireland had also suffered in 944 as dublin was sacked that year by the high king of ireland congalach cnogba , whose power base lay in brega , north of dublin on the lower reaches of the river boyne the following year , perhaps as a result of the sack of dublin , amlaíb 's cousin blácaire was driven out and amlaíb replaced him as ruler of dublin in 945 the two defeated part of ruaidrí 's army in conaille muirtheimne ( modern county louth ) and the following year amlaíb raided kilcullen in the province of leinster this defeat appears to have lost amlaíb his kingship , as the annals record that blácaire , not amlaíb , was the leader of the dublin forces in the following year while edmund certainly controlled northumbria after amlaíb was expelled and ragnall killed , he may soon after have lost control of the north to a scandinavian king named eiríkr , usually identified with eric bloodaxe the northumbrian submission to eadred led to a meeting with the notables of york led by archbishop wulfstan in 947 , but the following year king erik was back ruling northumbria and eadred laid waste to the southern parts of the kingdom— ripon is mentioned as a particular target—to force the northumbrians to expel erik , which they did the following year , 949 , by which time blacáire was dead and amlaíb 's brother ruling in dublin , the northumbrians invited amlaíb to rule in york that year máel coluim mac domnaill , the king of alba , raided northumbria as far south as the river tees , capturing many slaves and much loot a second invasion from the north in 952 , this time an alliance including máel coluim 's scots and also britons and saxons , was defeated erik 's reign was short and the viking kingdom of york was definitively incorporated into the kingdom of the english on his death in 954 amlaíb returned to ireland , never again to rule in york congalach 's rival ruaidrí was also dead , leaving amlaíb 's former ally as undisputed high king and thus a serious threat to dublin and the south-eastern irish kingdom of leinster the main beneficiary was the brother of amlaíb 's new wife dúnflaith , domnall ua néill , who became the next high king of ireland hudson , '' domnall ua néill '' ; hudson , viking pirates , page numbers needed in 960 the annals of ulster report that cammán , son of amlaíb mac gofrith , was defeated at an unidentifiable place named dub two years later one sitriuc cam—cam means crooked or twisted and cammán is simply the hypocoristic form of this byname , so that sitriuc cam and cammán are presumed to be the same person—was defeated by the dubliners led by amlaíb cuarán and the leinstermen while raiding in leinster another raid south in 964 ended in a heavy defeat for amlaíb near inistogue ( modern county kildare ) at the hands of the osraige muiredach , see byrne , '' church and politics '' , 673 ? downham , viking kings , pp until the late 960s domnall ua néill , congalach 's successor as would-be high king , was occupied with enemies close to home , and in connacht and munster , and did not intervene in leinster or the hinterlands of dublin this campaign appears to have established domnall ua néill as effective overlord of the midlands and leinster for some years úgaire 's successor domnall claen was little more fortunate , being captured by the dubliners the following year amlaíb 's former ally domnall son of congalach had died in 976 , removing one potential rival , and as amlaíb had killed two of domnall ua néill 's sons he may have cleared the way for máel sechnaill to take power amlaíb 's son ragnall ( rögnvaldr ) was among the dead in the battle which followed , and although several kings fighting alongside máel sechnaill were killed , the result was clearly a crushing blow for dublin
