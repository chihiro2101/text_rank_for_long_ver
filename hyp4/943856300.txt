the radius of the common nine-point circle is the distance from the nine-point center to the midpoint of any of the six connectors that join any pair of orthocentric points through which the common nine-point circle passes the common nine-point circle is tangent to all 16 incircles and excircles of the four triangles whose vertices form the orthocentric system the joining of these three orthogonal points into a triangle generates an orthic triangle that is common to all the four possible triangles formed from the four orthocentric points taken three at a time this relationship between the orthic triangle and the original four orthocentric points leads directly to the fact that the incenter and excenters of a reference triangle form an orthocentric system it is normal to distinguish one of the orthocentric points from the others , specifically the one that is the incenter of the orthic triangle ; this one is denoted h as the orthocenter of the outer three orthocentric points that are chosen as a reference triangle abc the orthic axis associated with a normalized orthocentric system a , b , c , and h , where abc is the reference triangle , is a line that passes through three intersection points formed when each side of the orthic triangle meets each side of the reference triangle consequently the circumcircles of the four triangles abc , abh , ach , bch are all equal and form a set of johnson circles as shown in the diagram adjacent because the nine-point circle is common to all four possible triangles in an orthocentric system it is tangent to 16 circles comprising the incircles and excircles of the four possible triangles so if a rectangular hyperbola is drawn through four orthocentric points it will have one fixed center on the common nine-point circle but it will have four perspectors one on each of the orthic axes of the four possible triangles the one point on the nine-point circle that is the center of this rectangular hyperbola will have four different definitions dependent on which of the four possible triangles is used as the reference triangle the well documented rectangular hyperbolas that pass through four orthocentric points are the feuerbach , jeřábek and kiepert circumhyperbolas of the reference triangle abc in a normalized system with h as the orthocenter the circumcubic known as the orthocubic - k006 is interesting in that it passes through three orthocentric systems as well as the three vertices of the orthic triangle ( but not the orthocenter of the orthic triangle )
