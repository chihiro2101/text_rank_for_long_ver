see , for instance , the ontario substitute decisions act if a person does not have the capacity to execute a power of attorney ( and does not already have a durable power in place ) , often the only way for another party to act on their behalf is to have a court impose a conservatorship or a guardianship depending on the jurisdiction , a power of attorney may be oral and , whether witnessed , will hold up in court , the same as if it were in writing the equal dignity rule is a principle of law that requires an authorization for someone performing certain acts for another person to have been appointed with the same formality as required for the act the representative is going to perform this means , for example , that if a principal authorizes someone to sell the principal 's house or other real property , and the law requires a contract for the sale of real property to be in writing ( which is required under the statute of frauds in most u.s even when not required , having the document reviewed and signed ( and often stamped ) by a notary public may increase the likelihood of withstanding a legal challenge if the attorney-in-fact is being paid to act on behalf of the principal , a contract for payment may be separate from the document granting power of attorney a special power of attorney is one that is limited to a specified act or type of act a general power of attorney is one that allows the agent to make all personal and business decisions a temporary power of attorney is one with a limited time frame if ever required , a durable power of attorney can be revoked or changed as long as the principal is still mentally competent to act '' this particular affidavit gives the attorney-in-fact the authority to make health-care decisions for the grantor , up to and including terminating care and life support depending upon the jurisdiction , a health care power of attorney may or may not appear with an advance health care directive in a single , physical document , medical doctors will often not reveal information relating to capacity of the principal unless the power of attorney specifically authorizes them to do so however , if the principal does not inform third parties and it is reasonable for the third parties to rely upon the power of attorney being in force , the principal might still be bound by the acts of the agent , though the agent may also be liable for such unauthorized acts although a power of attorney grants the agent powers to perform acts in the absence of the grantor , the poa can not grant powers to the agent that conflict with rules and regulations governing people and companies that the agent deals with an ordinary power of attorney is only valid for so long as the donor has the mental capacity to ratify the attorney 's actions a power of attorney can last , notwithstanding the incapacity of the donor , only if it is a lasting power of attorney : this is a separate and quite different type of power , which must be in a prescribed form , and , to be valid , once signed and witnessed must also be registered with the office of the public guardian it replaces the former enduring power of attorney , although enduring powers correctly made before the law changed remain valid examples are 'enduring power of attorney ' , 'advance directive ' , and 'notary public ' : in english law , these terms do not have the same meaning as they have in america in irish law there are two types of power of attorney : power of attorney , which may be general or specific , which ceases once the donor becomes mentally incapacitated part 7 of the assisted decision-making ( capacity ) act 2015 provides for new arrangements for those who wish to make an enduring power of attorney and once the 2015 act is brought into force , no new powers of attorney will be created under the 1996 act a solicitor is not required to create a power of attorney - it is created simply by being signed by the donor , in the presence of ( and countersigned by ) a witness creating an enduring power of attorney requires the following : it must be in a particular format a statement from a doctor stating that the doctor thought the donor had the mental capacity to understand the effect of creating the power of attorney when the document was executed a statement from the donor to say that they understood the effect of creating the power a statement from a solicitor to say they are satisfied that the donor understood the effect of creating the power of attorney a statement from a solicitor to say the donor was not acting under undue influence the courts play a general supervisory role in the implementation of the power notarial witnessing is mandatory if the power of attorney is made in order to enter into a contract to buy or sell an interest in land , as this has to be done on a public register
