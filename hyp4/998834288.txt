71 the ship 's primary offensive power would have been its aircraft complement construction of the ship was delayed since deutsche werke was working at capacity , and the slipway needed for graf zeppelin was occupied by the new battleship , which was launched on 8 december 1936 during a naval conference with hitler on 28 april 1940 , admiral erich raeder proposed halting all work on graf zeppelin , arguing that even if she was commissioned by the end of 1940 , final installation of her guns would need another ten months or more ( her original fire-control system had been sold to the soviet union under an earlier trade agreement ) by november , the german army had pushed deep enough into russian territory to remove any further threat of air attack and graf zeppelin was returned to gotenhafen raeder , anxious to secure air protection for the kriegsmarines heavier surface units , informed hitler that graf zeppelin could be finished in about a year , with another six months required for sea trials and flight training 283 changes in naval technology dictated other alterations as well : installation of air search radar sets and antennas ; upgraded radio equipment ; an armored fighter-director cabin mounted on the main mast ( which in turn meant a heavier , sturdier mast to accommodate the cabin 's added weight ) ; extra armoring for the bridge and fire control center ; a new curved funnel cap to shield the fighter-director cabin from smoke ; replacing the single-mount 20mm aa guns with quadruple flakvierling 38 guns ( with a corresponding increase in ammunition supply ) to improve overall aa defense ; and additional bulges on either side of the hull to preserve the ship 's stability under all this added weight 31 the german naval staff hoped all these changes could be accomplished by april 1943 , with the carrier 's first sea trials taking place in august that year hadeler planned on getting the two inner shafts and their respective propulsion systems operational first , giving the ship an initial speed of 25 & ndash ; 26 knots , fast enough for sea trials to commence and for conducting air training exercises on the night of 27–28 august 1942 , while still moored at gotenhafen , graf zeppelin was the target of the only allied air attack aimed at her during the war three royal air force avro lancaster heavy bombers from 106 squadron were dispatched against the german aircraft carrier , each one carrying a single '' capital ship '' bomb , a device with a shaped charge warhead intended for armored targets 50 one pilot , who was unable to see the carrier due to haze , dropped his bomb instead on the estimated position of the another believed he had scored a direct hit on graf zeppelin , but there is no known record of the ship suffering any damage from a bomb strike that night it seemed she might well see completion after all , but by late january 1943 hitler had become so disenchanted with the kriegsmarine , especially with what he perceived as the poor performance of its surface fleet , that he ordered all of its larger ships taken out of service and scrapped though admiral dönitz eventually persuaded hitler to void most of the order , work on all new surface ships and even those nearing completion , including graf zeppelin , was halted 32 on 30 january 1943 , all major work on the ship ceased , though some limited , temporary work continued until march the soviets could not repair the ship in the length of time specified by the terms of the tripartite naval commission , so she was designated a '' category c '' ship this classification required that she would be destroyed or sunk in deep water by 15 august 1946 on 14 august graf zeppelin was towed into swinemunde harbor , and two days later to its final position on 12 july 2006 , the research vessel , a ship belonging to the polish oil company petrobaltic , found a wreck north of władysławowo , which they thought was most likely graf zeppelin
