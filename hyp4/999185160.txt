the telescope design has two 8.4 & nbsp ; m ( 330 & nbsp ; inch ) mirrors mounted on a common base , hence the name '' binocular '' this area is equivalent to an circular aperture , which would be greater than any other single telescope , but it is not comparable in many respects since the light is collected at a lower diffraction limit and is not combined in the same way the first image taken combined ultraviolet and green light , and emphasizes the clumpy regions of newly formed hot stars in the spiral arms it can take images with one side at 8.4 m aperture , or take two images of the same object using different instruments on each side of the telescope using one 8.4 m side , it surpassed hubble sharpness ( at certain light wavelengths ) , achieving a strehl ratio of 60–80 % rather than the 20–30 % of older adaptive optic systems , or the 1 % typically achieved without adaptive optics for telescopes of this size lbt , with the xmm-newton , was used to discover the galaxy cluster 2xmm j083026+524133 in 2008 , over 7 billion light years away from earth some current or planned lbt telescope instruments : lbc – optical and near ultraviolet wide field prime focus cameras one is optimized for the blue part of the optical spectrum and one for the red ( both cameras operational ) pepsi – a high resolution and very high-resolution optical spectrograph and imaging polarimeter at the combined focus ( mods1 operational – mods2 in integration on the mountain ) luci – two multi-object and longslit infrared spectrographs plus imagers , one for each side ( associated with one of the 8m mirrors ) of the telescope ( in commissioning phase – first stabilization of the fringes in dec 2013 ) flao – first light adaptive optics to correct atmospheric distortion argos – multiple laser guide star unit capable of supporting ground layer or multi conjugate adaptive optics
