the pentium pro ( p6 ) featured many advanced concepts not found in the pentium , although it was n't the first or only x86 processor to implement them ( see nexgen nx586 or cyrix 6x86 ) the pentium pro pipeline had extra decode stages to dynamically translate ia-32 instructions into buffered micro-operation sequences which could then be analysed , reordered , and renamed in order to detect parallelizable operations that may be issued to more than one execution unit at once the pentium pro has a total of six execution units : two integer units , one floating-point unit ( fpu ) , a load unit , store address unit , and a store data unit one of the integer units shares the same ports as the fpu , and therefore the pentium pro can only dispatch one integer micro-op and one floating-point micro-op , or two integer micro-ops per a cycle , in addition to micro-ops for the other three execution units the pentium pro p6 microarchitecture was used in one form or another by intel for more than a decade despite being advanced for the time , the pentium pro 's out-of-order register renaming architecture had trouble with running 16-bit code and mixed code ( 8/16-bit or 16/32-bit ) , as using partial registers cause frequent pipeline flushing specific use of partial registers was a common performance optimization in the day , as it incurred no performance penalty on pre-p6 intel processors ; also , the dominant operating systems at the time of the pentium pro 's release were 16-bit dos and the mixed 16/32-bit windows 3.1x and windows 95 ( although the latter requires a 32-bit 80386 cpu , much of its code is still 16-bit for performance reasons , such as user.exe ) this , together with the high cost of pentium pro systems , caused rather lackluster reception among pc enthusiasts at the time the pentium pro 's integer performance lead disappeared rapidly , first overtaken by the mips technologies r10000 in january 1996 , and then by digital equipment corporation 's ev56 variant of the alpha 21164 methods to circumvent this included setting vesa drawing to system memory instead of video memory in games such as quake , and later on utilities such as fastvid emerged , which could double performance in certain games by enabling the write combining features of the cpu mtrrs are set automatically by windows video drivers starting from ~1997 , and there the improved cache/memory subsystem and fpu performance caused it to outclass the pentium clock-for-clock in the emerging 3d games of the mid–to–late 1990s , particularly when using nt4 however , its lack of mmx implementation reduces performance in multimedia applications that made use of those instructions at the time , manufacturing technology did not feasibly allow a large l2 cache to be integrated into the processor core intel instead placed the l2 die ( s ) separately in the package which still allowed it to run at the same clock speed as the cpu core additionally , unlike most motherboard-based cache schemes that shared the main system bus with the cpu , the pentium pro 's cache had its own back-side bus ( called dual independent bus by intel ) because of this , the cpu could read main memory and cache concurrently , greatly reducing a traditional bottleneck this cache alone gave the cpu an advantage in input/output performance over older x86 cpus this meant that a single , tiny flaw in either die made it necessary to discard the entire assembly , which was one of the reasons for the pentium pro 's relatively low production yield and high cost all versions of the chip were expensive , those with 1024 & nbsp ; kb being particularly so , since it required two 512 & nbsp ; kb cache dies as well as the processor die the process used to fabricate the pentium pro processor die and its separate cache memory die changed , leading to a combination of processes used in the same package : the 133 & nbsp ; mhz pentium pro prototype processor die was fabricated in a 0.6 & nbsp ; μm bicmos process featuring 512 & nbsp ; kb of full-speed cache , it was produced by intel as a drop-in upgrade option for owners of pentium pro systems l1 cache : 16 , 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb external chip on cpu module clocked at cpu-speed socket : socket & nbsp ; 8 multiplier : locked at 5× front side bus : 60 and 66 & nbsp ; mhz vcore : 3.1–3.3 & nbsp ; v ( has on-board voltage regulator ) fabrication : 0.25 & nbsp ; μm clockrate : based on the deschutes-generation pentium ii first release : 1997 supports mmx technology eight-way pentium pro computers were also built , but these used multiple buses the pentium pro was designed to include the 4-way smp split-transaction cache-coherent bus as a mandatory feature of every chip produced while the pentium pro was not successful as a machine for the masses , due to poor 16-bit support for windows 95 , it did become highly successful in the file server space due to its advanced , integrated bus design , introducing many advanced features that had previously only been available in the pricey workstation segment into the commodity marketplace
