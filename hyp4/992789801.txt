the circle which passes through the feet of the altitudes of a triangle is tangent to all four circles which in turn are tangent to the three sides of the triangle figure 3 a nine-point circle bisects a line segment going from the corresponding triangle 's orthocenter to any point on its circumcircle the nine-point circle of a reference triangle is the circumcircle of both the reference triangle 's medial triangle ( with vertices at the midpoints of the sides of the reference triangle ) and its orthic triangle ( with vertices at the feet of the reference triangle 's altitudes ) this is a consequence of symmetry : the sides of one triangle adjacent to a vertex that is an orthocenter to another triangle are segments from that second triangle remarkably , there exists a unique nine-point conic , centered at the centroid of these four arbitrary points , that passes through all seven points of intersection of these nine-point circles furthermore because of the feuerbach conic theorem mentioned above , there exists a unique rectangular circumconic , centered at the common intersection point of the four nine-point circles , that passes through the four original arbitrary points as well as the orthocenters of the four triangles consequently the four nine-point centers are cyclic and lie on a circle congruent to the four nine-point circles that is centered at the anticenter of the cyclic quadrilateral furthermore the cyclic quadrilateral formed from the four nine-pont centers is homothetic to the reference cyclic quadrilateral abcd by a factor of & nbsp ; & minus ; 1 / 2 & nbsp ; and its homothetic center ( n ) lies on the line connecting the circumcenter ( o ) to the anticenter ( m ) where : :on 2nm the circle is an instance of a conic section and the nine-point circle is an instance of the general nine-point conic that has been constructed with relation to a triangle abc and a fourth point p , where the particular nine-point circle instance arises when p is the orthocenter of abc the vertices of the triangle and p determine a complete quadrilateral and three '' diagonal points '' where opposite sides of the quadrilateral intersect the conic is an ellipse when p is interior to abc or in a region sharing vertical angles with the triangle , but a nine-point hyperbola occurs when p is in one of the three adjacent regions , and the hyperbola is rectangular when p lies on the circumcircle of abc
