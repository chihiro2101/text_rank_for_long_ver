early life and education later in life lombroso came to be influenced by gina 's husband , guglielmo ferrero , who led him to believe that not all criminality comes from one 's inborn factors and that social factors also played a significant role in the process of shaping a criminal in criminal woman , as introduced in an english translation by nicole hahn rafter and mary gibson , lombroso used his theory of atavism to explain women 's criminal offending in the text , lombroso outlines a comparative analysis of '' normal women '' opposed to '' criminal women '' such as '' the prostitute '' however , lombroso 's '' obdurate beliefs '' about women presented an '' intractable problem '' for this theory : '' because he was convinced that women are inferior to men lombroso was unable to argue , based on his theory of the born criminal , that women 's lesser involvement in crime reflected their comparatively lower levels of atavism although he gave some recognition in his later years to psychological and sociological factors in the etiology of crime , he remained convinced of , and identified with , criminal anthropometry his notions of physical differentiation between criminals and non-criminals were seriously challenged by charles goring ( the english convict , 1913 ) , who made elaborate comparisons and found insignificant statistical differences in the next several years , lombroso 's fascination with criminal behavior and society began , and he gained experience managing a mental institution lombroso differentiated himself from his predecessor and rival , cesare beccaria , through depicting his positivist school in opposition to beccaria 's classist one ( which centered around the idea that criminal behavior is born out of free will rather than inherited physical traits ) his school of thought was only truly abandoned in italian universities ' curriculum after world war ii through his various publications , lombroso established a school of psychiatry based on biological determinism and the idea that mental illness was via genetic factors lombroso 's theory has been cited as possibly '' the most influential doctrine '' in all areas studying human behavior , and indeed , its impact extended far and wide lombroso 's theories were likely accepted due to the pre-existing regional stigma against left-handedness , and greatly influenced the reception of left-handedness in the 20th century however , certain legal institutions did press back against the idea that criminal behavior is biologically determined within the penal system , lombroso 's work led to new forms of punishment , where occasionally punishment varied based on the defendant 's biological background lombroso and his followers argued for a criminal code , in which the criminal understood as unable to act with free will due to their biological predisposition to crime since his research tied criminal behavior together with the insane , lombroso is closely credited with the genesis of the criminal insane asylum and forensic psychiatry in addition to influencing criminal atavisim , lombroso wrote a book called genio e follia , in which he discussed the link between genius and insanity the meeting went poorly , and tolstoy 's novel resurrection shows great disdain for lombroso 's methodology towards the end of his life , lombroso began to study pellagra , a disease which joseph goldberger simultaneously was researching , in rural italy this disease also found its roots in the same poverty that caused cretinism , which lombroso studied at the start of his medical career this law gave psychiatrists rein within the criminal insane asylum , validating the field of psychiatry through giving the psychiatrists the sole authority to define and treat the causes of criminal behavior ( a position which lombroso argued for from his early teaching days to his death ) lombroso believed that genius was closely related to madness lombroso published the man of genius in 1889 , a book which argued that artistic genius was a form of hereditary insanity '' although his criteria are generally regarded as outdated today , his work inspired later writers on the subject , particularly hans prinzhorn lombroso 's work was also criticized by italian anthropologist giuseppe sergi who , in his review of lombroso 's the man of genius -- and specifically his classifications and definitions of '' the genius '' â€”stated '' by creating a genius according to his own fancy , an ideal and abstract being , and not by examining the personality of a real living genius , he naturally arrives at the conclusion that all theories by which the origin of genius is sought to be explained on a basis of observation , and especially that particular one which finds in degeneration the cause or one of the causes of genius , are erroneous the question : a brief history and examination of modern spiritualism historian daniel pick argues that lombroso serves '' as a curious footnote to late-nineteenth-century literary studies , '' due to his referencing in famous books of the time 1899 & nbsp ; crime : its causes and remedies 1909 & nbsp ; after death - what ? 1911 & nbsp ; criminal man , according to the classification of cesare lombroso 2004 & nbsp ; the criminal anthropological writings of cesare lombroso 2004 & nbsp ; criminal woman
