evidence about the composition of the first volume of waverley is inconclusive , but it was probably begun in 1808 and laid aside , continued in 1810 and again laid aside , and eventually taken up and completed in the later part of 1813 among the most consistently helpful books were : john home , the history of the rebellion in the year 1745 ( 1802 ) edmund burt , letters from a gentleman in the north of scotland ( 1754 ) donald macintosh , a collection of gaelic proverbs , and familiar phrases ( 1785 ) it is the time of the jacobite rising of 1745 which sought to restore the stuart dynasty in the person of charles edward stuart , known as '' bonnie prince charlie '' a young english dreamer and soldier , edward waverley , is sent to scotland that year he journeys north from his aristocratic family home , waverley-honour , in the south of england , first to the scottish lowlands and the home of family friend baron bradwardine , then into the highlands and the heart of the rebellion and its aftermath he spends time with his parents as well , though less time after his mother dies when he is about 12 or 13 years old edward has a sense of his honour , but he starts life with no political affiliation encouraged by the beautiful flora mac-ivor , edward goes over to the jacobite cause and takes part in the battle of prestonpans of september 1745 edward gets separated from fergus and both their bands in one battle that the government troops were winning he sees a newspaper that informs him that his father has died , so he heads to london after making contact with the baron , he asks for his daughter 's hand in marriage , and soon is the established lover of rose edward then returns to his uncle and aunt on the waverley honour and begins preparations for their wedding and also to make the legal appearances to assure the pardons of edward and his future father-in-law 2 waverley honour.—a retrospect : edward waverley 's father richard defects to the whigs , which almost leads his older brother sir everard , a confirmed tory and bachelor , to disinherit him and his family , but he has second thoughts and warms to edward as a young boy 3 education : transferred to sir everard 's seat , waverley-honour , to be educated by his chaplain mr pembroke , edward is allowed to follow a lively but undisciplined course of reading which stimulates his imagination rather than benefiting his understanding 5 choice of a profession : to prevent edward succumbing to the charms of a local beauty miss cæcilia stubbs , rachael sets in train negotiations which result in his receiving an army commission 7 a horse-quarter in scotland : edward finds military life in angus boring and obtains from his commanding officer colonel g——— a few weeks ' leave of absence to make an excursion 8 a scottish manor house sixty years since : edward arrives at the hamlet and estate of tully-veolan 10 rose bradwardine and her father : edward encounters rose bradwardine and her father , who gives an account of four guests expected for dinner 13 a more rational day than the last : after hunting with bradwardine , edward is entertained by rose , who tells how gellatley 's mother janet had been regarded as a witch 2 ( 25 ) news from england : letters from england inform edward that his father has engaged in political intrigue and been dismissed from government service 3 ( 26 ) an eclaircissement : after expressing reservations about edward joining the jacobites , flora asks for an hour to consider his profession of love for her 4 ( 27 ) upon the same subject : flora indicates to edward that she can never fulfil his idea of domestic happiness and urges him to return to england 8 ( 31 ) an examination : edward is examined by the justice of the peace major mellville , with mr morton the minister ; the case against him mounts up , including evidence that by means of an agent he had tempted his compatriot sergeant houghton to desert to the jacobite cause 16 ( 39 ) the journey is continued : edward is conducted to edinburgh by a party under balmawhapple 3 ( 50 ) rather unimportant : committed by charles to edward 's care , talbot agrees not to attempt to escape without his knowledge 4 ( 51 ) intrigues of love and politics : edward examines the packet in his portmanteau which contains earlier letters from colonel g——— requesting his return from the highlands 7 ( 54 ) '' to one thing constant never '' : flora uses a reading of romeo and juliet to direct edward towards rose rather than herself 14 ( 61 ) a journey to london : learning from a newspaper of his father 's death and of sir everard 's impending trial for high treason in his nephew 's absence , edward makes his way to london ; he is embarrassed en route by the enquires of mrs nosebag , a military wife 15 ( 62 ) what 's to be done next ? : talbot tells edward that the report of sir everard 's accusation is false and arranges for him to travel back to scotland posing as his nephew probably the most dramatic example occurs in frankenstein , when the title character -- after wavering between opposed truth-possibilities in a manner that recalls scott 's edward waverley -- finally finds himself ( literally ) in identification with his own species however , we should also note that welsh is , first , establishing a typology which in part is age-old , but also reinforced throughout the waverley novels ; second , that scott , or his narrators , allow the female characters thoughts , feelings and passions which are often ignored or unacknowledged by the heroes , such as waverley thus , flora will defy waverley but not fergus to any significant extent , and has some room to manoeuvre , even though limited , only after the latter 's death yet another view considers flora to be the woman representing the past , while rose symbolises a modern rational scotland in the post-union settlement the opening five chapters of waverley are often thought to be dour and uninteresting , an impression in part due to scott 's own comments on them at the end of chapter five the comments on the relay of information via dyers weekly letter , the self-explanatory name of the lawyer , clippurse , sir everard 's desire and courting of the youngest sister , lady emily , all point in this direction scott uses a common humorous reference to the old testament story that david and supporting malcontents took refuge from saul in a cave near the town of adullam the division in the waverley family had been caused by the english civil war of the mid-seventeenth century fear of civil war is ever-present in waverley not just as subject matter or historical reality , but a primal fear as deep in scott as in shakespeare as manifested by various allusions throughout the novel and by direct references to henry v and henry vi in chapter 71 as scott describes him , edward waverley is like don quixote in his manner of educating himself by much reading , but as '' an unstructured education '' , and as scott says in the novel '' consisting of much curious , though ill-arranged and miscellaneous information for a full list of contemporaneous british reviews see william s the anti-jacobin review and the critical review considered the work too scottish , and the latter ( assuming scott 's authorship ) thought it odd for an established poet to become a 'scribbler ' while the new annual register found it less interesting than might have been expected from his hand in the quarterly review john wilson croker , writing anonymously like all the reviewers , compared it to dutch paintings , congenial rather than exalted , and advised the author to stick to history , while the scourge considered that scott did not take readers beyond their usual susceptibilities in eckermann 's conversations with goethe , goethe lauded waverley as '' the best novel by sir walter scott , '' and he asserted that scott '' has never written anything to surpass , or even equal , that first published novel '' he regarded scott as a genius and as one of the greatest writers of english of his time , along with lord byron and thomas moore '' in 1815 , scott was given the honour of dining with george , prince regent , who wanted to meet '' the author of waverley '' it is thought that at this meeting scott persuaded george that as a stuart prince he could claim to be a jacobite highland chieftain , a claim that would be dramatised when george became king and visited scotland london : edward arnold his critique has received fierce opposition from scott scholars , who believe his attack is a symptom of his ignorance , perhaps of literature , but more certainly of all things scottish waverly , pennsylvania , listed in the national register of historic places , draws its name from the novel by sir walter scott a succession of paddle steamers have been named after the novel , culminating in the present ps waverley waverly place in greenwich village , new york city , was named for the novel in 1833 , a year after scott 's death , though the name was misspelled several of the street names also get their name from the novel the proposition '' scott is the author of waverley '' is one of the examples whose meaning bertrand russell studied in his paper '' on denoting ''
