the devices have been miniaturized , enabling direct measurement of ph inside of living cells potentiometric ph meters measure the voltage between two electrodes and display the result converted into the corresponding ph value they comprise a simple electronic amplifier and a pair of electrodes , or alternatively a combination electrode , and some form of display calibrated in ph units the design of the electrodes is the key part : these are rod-like structures usually made of glass , with a bulb containing the sensor at the bottom on immersion in the solution to be tested , hydrogen ions in the test solution exchange for other positively charged ions on the glass bulb , creating an electrochemical potential across the bulb the electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to ph units on immersion of the glass electrode and the reference electrode in the test solution , an electrical circuit is completed , in which there is a potential difference created and detected by the voltmeter the voltage varies from test solution to test solution depending on the potential difference created by the difference in hydrogen-ion concentrations on each side of the glass membrane between the test solution and the solution inside the glass electrode for simplicity , many ph meters use a combination probe , constructed with the glass electrode and the reference electrode contained within a single probe the ph meter is calibrated with solutions of known ph , typically before each use , to ensure accuracy of measurement to measure the ph of a solution , the electrodes are used as probes , which are dipped into the test solutions and held there sufficiently long for the hydrogen ions in the test solution to equilibrate with the ions on the surface of the bulb on the glass electrode there is a ceramic plug , which serves as a contact to the test solution , providing low resistance while preventing mixing of the two solutions consistent with principles of good laboratory practice , calibration is performed with at least two standard buffer solutions that span the range of ph values to be measured standard buffer sachets , available from a variety of suppliers , usually document the temperature dependence of the buffer control thumb image : soil ph meter.jpg thumb right soil ph meter ph meters range from simple and inexpensive pen-like devices to complex and expensive laboratory instruments with computer interfaces and several inputs for indicator and temperature measurements to be entered to adjust for the variation in ph caused by temperature there are also holographic ph sensors , which allow ph measurement colorimetrically , making use of the variety of ph indicators that are available additionally , there are commercially available ph meters based on isfet , rather than conventional glass electrodes however , with purchase of suitable electrodes , a standard multimeter can be used to complete the construction of the ph meter
