it contains an abundance of plant remains which in turn reflect a period of rich floral growth at this time however , subsequent colonization by common reed , whose fossilized root fragments have been found immediately above the nekron mud layer , lead to a reduced extent of open water the increased elevation of the central peat mound began to cut off the direct influx of base-rich waters into the bog from the surrounding land and existing bases in the raised peat were leached out through rainfall therefore , net loss of bases from the peat in the centre of the bog gradually led to increased soil acidity , with loss of the original rich fen community which previously covered the whole area the ecological diversity is attributable to a wide diversity of habitats ranging from fen-meadow with base-rich ground on the periphery to more inward carr woodland and raised bog with acid soil ; interspersed with ditch and stands of open water the large habitat diversity may be partly explained by the many successional stages present which generally become more advanced towards the centre , in turn related to spatial differences in topography and soil ph askham bog is one of the few northern examples in england to show such an array of habitat transitions although the raised bog originally largely replaced the original fen , medieval peat cutting brought the vegetation back within the influence of base-rich ground water the extensive peat cutting in turn led to a return to fen conditions around some of the previously acid soils especially where much of the wood in the north central part has been clear-felled the vegetation of askham bog can be divided into two main groups , reflecting the broad underlying dichotomy between basic and acidic soil despite nearby potential sources of human disturbance , the bog provides a suitable shelter within a relatively bare surrounding agricultural landscape and has a rich fruit and seed supply in winter and a richness of invertebrates in summer all migrant warblers have been found at the bog in spring and summer , with the reed beds in the northeast part in near wood comprising an important colony for reed warblers some rare beetle species include dromius sigma , agabus undulatus ; alongside one record of pselaphus dresdensis which has been found in moss from pond sides at the bog and nowhere else in england however , beetle abundance and species richness have been noticeably declining at askham bog since the early 20th century , coinciding with the establishment of a municipal dumping ground at the adjacent challoner 's whin regarding spiders , there is a surprisingly large proportion of wetland indicator species given the relatively dry status of the reserve and gradual encroachment by trees this may be because the spider community reflects a time when the bog was wetter and is yet to completely respond to the habitat changes the earliest evidence of nearby peat cutting from the roman period has been found in a roman well in york in the form of lumps of sphagnum peat in fact , intensive peat cutting had probably caused substantial topographical changes on the bog since its original geographic formation in turn , a lowering of the acid peat layer due to extraction would have allowed the centre to become flooded by base-rich groundwater , thereby re-transforming it into an open fen other material evidence exists in the form of dykes surrounding the current main peat domes , of which the former would have been dug to aid removal of peat by boat there is some documentary evidence for this at askham bog in the acomb court roll of 1594 , which restricted where hemp could be retted ( steeped ) owing to the malodour produced by retted fibres and the potential for the retting water to pollute rivers however , some meadows on site are still cut for hay
