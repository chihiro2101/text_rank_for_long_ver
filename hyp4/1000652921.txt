other pathways including the stress response pathways jak-stat and p38 , nutritional signalling via foxo , and jnk cell death signalling are all involved in key physiological responses to infection the cellular immune response instead refers to the direct activity of blood cells ( hemocytes ) in drosophila , which are analogous to mammalian monocytes/macrophages although the fly 's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens , drosophila differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria this core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response , stress response , secretion , neuron-like , reproduction , and metabolism among others drosophila also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli however , the core elements of this innate immune response are conserved between humans and fruit flies as a result , the fruit fly offers a useful model of innate immunity for disentangling genetic interactions of signalling and effector function , as flies do not have to contend with interference of adaptive immune mechanisms that could confuse results various genetic tools , protocols , and assays make drosophila a classical model for studying the innate immune system , which has even included immune research on the international space station the first description of toll-like receptors involved in the response to infection was performed in drosophila this regulatory cascade is initiated following pathogen recognition by pattern recognition receptors , particularly of gram-positive bacteria , parasites , and fungal infection upon infection , pro-spatzle is cleaved by the protease spe ( spatzle processing enzyme ) to become active spatzle , which binds to the toll receptor located on the cell surface of the fat body and dimerizes for activation of downstream nf-Îºb signaling pathways , including multiple death domain containing proteins and negative regulators such as the ankyrin repeat protein cactus upon infection , amps increase in expression sometimes by 1000-fold , providing unmistakable readouts of pathway activation imd signalling and relish specifically are also involved in the regulation of immunity at surface epithelia including in the gut and respiratory tracts jak-stat induction leads to the production of a number of stress response proteins including thioester-containing proteins ( teps ) , turandots , and the putative antimicrobial peptide listericin for instance , the teps appear to promote phagocytosis of gram-positive bacteria and the induction of the toll pathway this has been demonstrated both through genetic tools to generate flies lacking hemocytes , or through injecting microglass beads or lipid droplets that saturate hemocyte ability to phagocytose a secondary infection these hemocytes derive from two waves of hematopoiesis , one occurring in the early embryo and one occurring during development from larva to adult work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations ( and others like them ) affect a group of genes and their products that form a biochemical or circadian rhythm this clock is found in a wide range of fly cells , but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly 's central brain since then , benzer and others have used behavioral screens to isolate genes involved in vision , olfaction , audition , learning/memory , courtship , pain , and other processes , such as longevity for example , this technique showed that male courtship behavior is controlled by the brain young for their works using fruit flies in understanding the '' molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm '' in particular , the fruitless gene has several different splice forms , and male flies expressing female splice forms have female-like behavior and vice versa a 2017 study found that songs promoting aggression contain pulses occurring at longer intervals rna-seq from fly mutants displaying over-aggressive behaviors found more than 50 auditory-related genes ( important for transient receptor potentials , calcium signaling , and mechanoreceptor potentials ) to be upregulated in the ab neurons located in johnston 's organ in addition , aggression levels were reduced when these genes were knocked out via rna interference other than hearing , another sensory modality that regulates aggression is pheromone signaling , which operates through either the olfactory system or the taste depending on the pheromone however , upon inserting a mutation that makes the flies irresponsive to cva , no aggressive behaviors were seen ip 3 is thought to bind to ip 3 receptors in the subrhabdomeric cisternae , an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum , and cause release of calcium , but this process does not seem to be essential for normal vision these proteins interact with other proteins and have been shown to be necessary for shut off of the light response disruption of the complex by mutations in either the pdz domains or the target proteins reduces the efficiency of signaling this means that grooming behaviors that occur at the beginning of the sequence prevent those that come later in the sequence from occurring simultaneously , as the grooming sequence consists of mutually exclusive behaviors for example , the eyes and antennae are likely executed early on in the grooming sequence to prevent debris from interfering with the function of d however , subsequent work showed that while the viscous effects on the insect body during flight may be negligible , the aerodynamic forces on the wings themselves actually cause fruit flies ' turns to be damped viscously however , because drosophila do not transmit human disease and are essentially harmless , they do not fulfill the criteria to be classified as a vector
