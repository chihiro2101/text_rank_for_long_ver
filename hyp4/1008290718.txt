the kerf depends on several factors : the width of the saw blade ; the set of the blade 's teeth ; the amount of wobble created during cutting ; and the amount of material pulled out of the sides of the cut although the term '' kerf '' is often used informally , to refer simply to the thickness of the saw blade , or to the width of the set , this can be misleading , because blades with the same thickness and set may create different kerfs the kerf created by a given blade can be changed by adjusting the set of its teeth with a tool called a saw tooth setter those with more teeth per inch at the toe are described as having incremental teeth , in order to make starting the saw cut easier barley , simon '' british saws and saw makers from c1660 , 2014 rake : the angle of the front face of the tooth relative to a line perpendicular to the length of the saw teeth designed to cut with the grain ( ripping ) are generally steeper than teeth designed to cut across the grain ( crosscutting ) set : the degree to which the teeth are bent out sideways away from the blade , usually in both directions for example , a rip saw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel , so that it rips or tears the material apart a '' flush-cutting saw '' has no set on one side , so that the saw can be laid flat on a surface and cut along that surface without scratching it the set of the blade 's teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw set web : a narrow saw blade held in a frame , worked either by hand or in a machine , sometimes with teeth on both edges as the saw developed , teeth were raked to cut only on the pull stroke and set with the teeth projecting only on one side , rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set in the iron age , frame saws were developed holding the thin blades in tension early european saws were made from a heated sheet of iron or steel , produced by flattening by several men simultaneously hammering on an anvil ( barley ibid p11 ) after cooling , the teeth were punched out one at a time with a die , the size varying with the size of the saw the industry gradually mechanized all the processes , including the important grinding the saw plate '' thin to the back '' by a fraction of an inch , which helped the saw to pass through the kerf without binding ( moxon , ibid , p95 ) most hand saws are today entirely made without human intervention , with the steel plate supplied ready rolled to thickness and tensioned before being cut to shape by laser hand saws typically have a relatively thick blade to make them stiff enough to cut through material ) thin-bladed handsaws are made stiff enough either by holding them in tension in a frame , or by backing them with a folded strip of steel ( formerly iron ) or brass ( on account of which the latter are called '' back saws '' ) some examples of hand saws are : artillery saw , chain saw , portable link saw : a flexible chain saw up to four feet long , supplied to the military for clearing tree branches for gun sighting ;
