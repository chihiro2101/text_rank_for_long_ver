as protestantism spread among the laity of the teutonic monastic state of prussia , dissent began to develop against the roman catholic rule of the teutonic knights , whose grand master , albert , duke of prussia , a member of a cadet branch of the house of hohenzollern , lacked the military resources to assert the order 's authority at wittenberg in 1522 , and at nuremberg in 1524 , martin luther encouraged him to convert the order 's territory into a secular principality under his personal rule , as the teutonic knights would not be able to survive the reformation on april 10 , 1525 albert resigned his position , became a protestant , and in the prussian homage was granted the title '' duke of prussia '' by his uncle , king sigismund i of poland when albert returned to königsberg , he publicly declared his conversion and announced to a quorum of teutonic knights his new ducal status some of the knights converted to lutheranism in order to retain their property and then married into the prussian nobility , while others returned to the holy roman empire , and remained catholic these remaining teutonic knights , led by the next grand master , walter von cronberg , continued to unsuccessfully claim prussia , but retained much of the estates in the teutonic bailiwicks outside of prussia albert was greatly aided by his elder brother george , margrave of brandenburg-ansbach , who had earlier established the protestant religion in his territories of franconia and upper silesia because ducal prussia was ostensibly a lutheran land , authorities traveled throughout the duchy ensuring that lutheran teachings were being followed and imposing penalties on pagans and dissidents following king sigismund iii 's prussian regency contract ( 1605 ) with joachim frederick of brandenburg and his treaty of warsaw , 1611 , with john sigismund of brandenburg , confirming the brandenburgian co-inheritance of prussia , these two regents guaranteed the free practice of catholic religion in prevailingly lutheran prussia many of the prussian junkers were opposed to rule by the house of hohenzollern of berlin and appealed to sigismund iii vasa for redress , or even incorporation of ducal prussia into the polish kingdom , but without success brandenburg , being a fief of the holy roman empire , and ducal prussia , being a polish fief , made a cross-border real union legally impossible yet , during the second northern war , charles x gustav of sweden invaded ducal prussia and dictated the treaty of königsberg ( january 1656 ) , which made the duchy a swedish fief when the tide of the war turned against charles x gustav , he concluded the treaty of labiau ( november 1656 ) , making frederick william i the full sovereign in ducal prussia and warmia , which , however , was part of poland after almost 200 years of polish suzerainty over the teutonic monastic state of prussia and its successor ducal prussia , the territory passed under the full sovereignty of brandenburg ) however , the end of polish suzerainty was met with resistance of the population , regardless of ethnicity , as it was afraid of brandenburg absolutism and wished to remain part of the crown of the kingdom of poland the burghers of the capital city of königsberg , led by hieronymus roth , rejected the treaties of wehlau and oliva and viewed prussia as '' indisputably contained within the territory of the polish crown '' 126 ( in polish ) it was noted that the incorporation into the polish crown under the treaty of kraków was approved by the city of königsberg , while the separation from poland took place without the city 's consent polish king john ii casimir vasa was asked for help , masses were held in protestant churches for the polish king and the polish kingdom after the kingdom of prussia 's annexation of the bulk of the province of royal prussia in the first partition of poland in 1772 , former ducal prussia — including previously polish-controlled warmia within royal prussia — was reorganized into the province of east prussia , while most of former royal prussia became the province of west prussia
