these approaches and ideas have been extended to other areas of physics as statistical mechanics , continuum mechanics , classical field theory and quantum field theory following mathematics : the theory of partial differential equation , variational calculus , fourier analysis , potential theory , and vector analysis are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical physics the theory of atomic spectra ( and , later , quantum mechanics ) developed almost concurrently with some parts of the mathematical fields of linear algebra , the spectral theory of operators , operator algebras and more broadly , functional analysis the special and general theories of relativity require a rather different type of mathematics this was group theory , which played an important role in both quantum field theory and differential geometry this was , however , gradually supplemented by topology and functional analysis in the mathematical description of cosmological as well as quantum field theory phenomena it relies upon the hamiltonian mechanics ( or its quantum version ) and it is closely related with the more mathematical ergodic theory and some parts of probability theory certain parts of mathematics that initially arose from the development of physics are not , in fact , considered parts of mathematical physics , while other closely related fields are john herapath used the term for the title of his 1847 text on '' mathematical principles of natural philosophy '' ; the scope at that time being '' the causes of heat , gaseous elasticity , gravitation , and other great phenomena of nature '' john herapath ( 1847 ) mathematical physics ; or , the mathematical principles of natural philosophy , the causes of heat , gaseous elasticity , gravitation , and other great phenomena of nature , whittaker and company via hathitrust the term '' mathematical physics '' is sometimes used to denote research aimed at studying and solving problems in physics or thought experiments within a mathematically rigorous framework in the latter case , he is usually considered as a specialist in mathematical physics mathematical physics in this sense emphasizes the mathematical rigour of the similar type as found in mathematics on the other hand , theoretical physics emphasizes the links to observations and experimental physics , which often requires theoretical physicists ( and mathematical physicists in the more general sense ) to use heuristic , intuitive , and approximate arguments for example , the development of quantum mechanics and some aspects of functional analysis parallel each other in many ways the attempt to construct a rigorous mathematical formulation of quantum field theory has also brought about some progress in fields such as representation theory isaac newton ( 1642–1727 ) developed some concepts in calculus ( although gottfried wilhelm leibniz developed similar concepts outside the context of physics ) and newton 's method to solve problems in physics he was extremely successful in his application of calculus to the theory of motion newton 's theory of motion , shown in his mathematical principles of natural philosophy , published in 1687 , modeled three galilean laws of motion along with newton 's law of universal gravitation on a framework of absolute space—hypothesized by newton as a physically real entity of euclidean geometric structure extending infinitely in all directions—while presuming absolute time , supposedly justifying knowledge of absolute motion , the object 's motion with respect to absolute space hamiltonian dynamics had played an important role in the formulation of modern theories in physics , including field theory and quantum mechanics the french mathematical physicist joseph fourier ( 1768 – 1830 ) introduced the notion of fourier series to solve the heat equation , giving rise to a new approach to solving partial differential equations by means of integral transforms the french pierre-simon laplace ( 1749–1827 ) made paramount contributions to mathematical astronomy , potential theory also in 1905 , albert einstein ( 1879–1955 ) published his special theory of relativity , newly explaining both the electromagnetic field 's invariance and galilean invariance by discarding all hypotheses concerning aether , including the existence of aether itself another revolutionary development of the 20th century was quantum theory , which emerged from the seminal contributions of max planck ( 1856–1947 ) ( on planck 's law ) and einstein 's work on the photoelectric effect this revolutionary theoretical framework is based on a probabilistic interpretation of states , and evolution and measurements in terms of self-adjoint operators on an infinite-dimensional vector space that is called hilbert space ( introduced by mathematicians david hilbert ( 1862–1943 ) , erhard schmidt ( 1876-1959 ) and frigyes riesz ( 1880-1956 ) in search of generalization of euclidean space and study of integral equations ) , and rigorously defined within the axiomatic modern version by john von neumann in his celebrated book mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics , where he built up a relevant part of modern functional analysis on hilbert spaces , the spectral theory ( introduced by david hilbert who investigated quadratic forms with infinitely many variables
