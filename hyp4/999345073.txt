the original rationale behind their design was that they were intended to operate as adjuncts to the main battle fleet , based on standard-type battleships since world war i they were to scout out ahead of the fleet and report on the enemy fleet 's composition , speed , and course , then they were to attack and whittle down the enemy in preparation for the main fleet action , a titanic gun battle between battleships and cruisers to operate effectively in this role , a submarine had to have high surface speed , long range and endurance , and heavy armament navy experimented constantly with this concept in the post-world war i years , producing a series of submarines with less than stellar qualities and reliability , the ( also known as the t class ) and the v-boats , of which v-1 through v-3 were an unsuccessful attempt to produce a fleet submarine by 1931 , the experimental phase of fleet submarine development was over and the navy began to make solid progress towards what would eventually be the gato class by 1940 , a much better developed industrial base and experience gained from the porpoise- , - , and boats resulted in the tambor-class submarine navy had hit the right combination of factors and now had the long-desired fleet submarine the attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 destroyed the pacific fleet battle line and along with it the concept of the battleship-led gun battle , as well as 20 years of submarine strategic concept development fortunately , the same capabilities that would have enabled these submarines to operate with the fleet made them superbly qualified for their new mission of commerce raiding against the japanese empire operational experience with earlier boats led the naval architects and engineers at the navy 's bureau of construction and repair to believe that they had been unduly conservative in their estimates of hull strength without changing the construction or thickness of the pressure hull steel , they decided that the gato-class boats would be fully capable of routinely operating at 300 feet , a increase in test depth over the preceding classes sufficient fuel bunkerage to provide the range necessary for 75-day patrols from hawaii to japan and back could be obtained only with a larger boat , which would take longer to submerge than a smaller one based on later wartime experience , the tank was normally kept full or nearly full at the surface , then emptied to a certain mark after the boat was submerged to restore neutral buoyancy at the start of the war , these boats could go from fully surfaced to periscope depth in about 45–50 seconds by midwar , these measures combined with improved crew training got dive times down to 30–35 seconds , very fast for such a large boat and acceptable to the boat 's crew the bureau designers felt that if a crew of 60–80 men were to be expected to conduct 75-day patrols in the warm waters of the pacific , these types of features were vital to the health and efficiency of the crew they could be added without impact to the boat 's war fighting abilities due to the extra room of the big fleet boat twelve submarines of this class built by electric boat received what would be the final installations of the hooven-owens-rentschler ( hor ) double-acting diesel engine the other gato-class boats received either the fairbanks-morse 38d 8-1/8 nine-cylinder opposed-piston engine or the general motors cleveland 16-248 v-type as original installations submarines lost in world war ii were of this class , plus , a damaged boat that returned to the u.s ″united states submarine losses world war ii″ , naval history division , office of the chief of naval operations , washington : 1963 ( fifth printing ) occasionally , some confusion arises as to the number of gato-class submarines built , with some sources listing the total as 73 , due to the transitional nature of the first four boats ( ss-361 through ss-364 ) constructed under the second contract by the manitowoc shipbuilding company of manitowoc , wisconsin electric boat , due to the huge backlog of gato-class construction , was not ready to make the transition to the new design until january 1943 faced with a work stoppage while they waited for electric boat to catch up , managers at manitowoc got permission to complete four additional boats ( ss-361 through ss-364 ) to electric boat 's gato-class plans due to their large construction capacity , more than half ( 41 ) of the class was built at electric boat facilities ; three new slipways were added to the north yard and four slipways were added to the south yard to accommodate their production called the victory yard , it became an integral part of electric boat operations considered a waste of valuable resources , in mid-1943 , all six boats were recalled and transferred to the pacific many of these boats racked up impressive war records : , , and were the top three boats based on tonnage sunk by u.s due to a stunted research-and-development phase in the depression-era 1930s , and in great part due to the arrogance and stubbornness of its designer , the naval torpedo station newport under the bureau of ordnance , the '' wonder weapon '' mark 14 proved to be full of bugs and very unreliable the mark 18 electric torpedo was a hastily copied version of captured g7e torpedo weapons and was rushed into service in the fall of 1943 once perfected , both types of torpedoes proved to be reliable and effective weapons , allowing the gatos and other submarines to sink an enormous amount of japanese shipping by the end of the war fleet submarines part one : gato class ( with a tambor/gar class postscript ) 1941–1945 johnston , david ( 2010 ) navsource naval history website the modifications ( or mods ) to the gato-class conning tower fairwaters were fairly uniform in nature and they can be grouped together based on what was done when : mod 1 – this is the original configuration with the covered navigation bridge , the high bulwark around the aft '' cigarette '' deck , and with the periscope shears plated over many targets in the pacific war were sampans or otherwise not worth a torpedo , so the deck gun was an important weapon most boats began the war with a 3 '' /50 caliber gun ( although some boats received older mk the 3-inch gun was the model originally specified for the gato class , but war experience led to the removal of 4 '' /50 caliber gun from old s-class submarines to equip front-line boats beginning in late 1943 , almost all were refitted with a 5 '' /25 caliber gun , and some boats had two of these weapons barb also conducted several rocket attacks against shore targets on this same patrol , the first ever by an american submarine went to the rescue of a grounded dutch submarine , taking its crew on board and destroying the submarine when it could not be removed from the reef , the only international submarine-to-submarine rescue in history along with conducted an aggressive and successful attack against japanese fleet units during the lead up to the u.s examined by engineers , she was found to be beyond economical repair and was decommissioned on 18 july 1945 , never having made another war patrol dealey , the only submarine commander of the war ( perhaps the only one ever ) to sink five enemy destroyers , four in a single patrol is officially credited with sinking 23 ships , the third-most of any allied world war ii submarine , behind only and , according to janac figures the 56 remaining gato-class submarines , designed to fight an enemy that no longer existed , were largely obsolete , despite the fact they were only two to four years old surface ships radar picket were put into service , but they proved vulnerable in this role , as they could be attacked , as well , leaving the fleet blind after experimenting with the concept on several balao and tench-class boats , and realizing that a deep diving depth was not overly important in this role , six gatos were taken in hand , , , , , and for conversion the threat of the soviet navy building hundreds of type xxi-derived submarines ( eventually the 215-strong and dozens of others ) in the atlantic led the u.s concluding that this role did not require a fast or deep-diving submarine ( this line of thought would quickly change with the advent of nuclear power ) , seven gatos were converted to ssks ( hunter-killer submarines ) between 1951 and 1953 , joining three purpose-built k-1-class ssks entering service at that time eventually , more advanced sonars were installed on the new nuclear boats , with introducing the bow-mounted sonar sphere , and the ssk mission was folded into the regular attack submarine role , commissioned in 1960 , was an attempt to develop a slow but ultra-quiet nuclear-powered ssk equivalent , but no others were built two gatos , and ( previously the prototype hunter-killer boat ) were assigned to these duties and proved to be key players in the development of new sonar capabilities interested in maintaining a ready pool of trained reservists , the navy assigned numerous fleet boats to various coastal and inland ports ( even in great lakes ports such as chicago , cleveland , and detroit ) where they served as a training platform during the reservists ' weekend drills all post war data from reserve training boats at submarinesailor.com six gato-class submarines are open to public viewing
