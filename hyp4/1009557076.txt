this primary arrangement was different from the normal arrangements in southern europe , in parts of asia , and the middle east where it was common for young adults to remain in or marry into the family home george murdock , an observer of families , offered an early description : many individuals are part of two nuclear families in their lives : the family of origin in which they are offspring , and the family of procreation in which they are a parent alternative definitions have evolved to include family units headed by lgbt parentings and perhaps additional adult relatives who take on a cohabiting parental role ; '' strictly , a nuclear or elementary or conjugal family consists merely of parents and children , though it often includes one or two other relatives as well , for example , a widowed parent or unmarried sibling of one or other spouse when extended family is involved they also influence children 's development just as much as the parents would on their own in an extended family resources are usually shared among those involved , adding more of a community aspect to the family unit according to some sociologists , '' the nuclear family no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today a new term has been introduced , postmodern family , intended to describe the great variability in family forms , including single-parent families and couples without children haak said , '' by establishing the genetic links between the two adults and two children buried together in one grave , we have established the presence of the classic nuclear family in a prehistoric context in central europe as a fertility factor , single nuclear family households generally have a higher number of children than co-operative living arrangements according to studies from both the western world and india a study done in japan between october 2011 and february 2012 further researched the effect of area of residence on mean desired number of children researchers of the study came to the conclusion that the women living in rural areas with larger families were more likely to want more children , compared to women that lived in urban areas in japan the numbers of nuclear families is slowly dwindling in the us as more women pursue higher education , develop professional lives , and delay having children until later in their life data from 2014 also suggests that single parents and the likelihood of children living with one is also correlated with race differences in education level also change the amount of single parents critics of the term '' traditional family '' point out that in most cultures and at most times , the extended family model has been most common , not the nuclear family , though it has had a longer tradition in england see than in other parts of europe and asia which contributed large numbers of immigrants to the americas
