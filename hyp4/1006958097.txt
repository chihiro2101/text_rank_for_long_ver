474–526 it is believed to occur via a single , cyclic transition state , with no intermediates generated during the course of the reaction as such , the diels–alder reaction is governed by orbital symmetry considerations : it is classified as a π 4 s + π 2 s cycloaddition , indicating that it proceeds through the suprafacial/suprafacial interaction of a 4π electron system ( the diene structure ) with a 2π electron system ( the dienophile structure ) , an interaction that leads to a transition state without an additional orbital symmetry-imposed energetic barrier and allows the diels-alder reaction to take place with relative ease since the reactants are in their ground state , the reaction is initiated thermally and does not require activation by light despite the fact that the vast majority of diels–alder reactions exhibit stereospecific , syn addition of the two components , a diradical intermediate has been postulated ( and supported with computational evidence ) on the grounds that the observed stereospecificity does not rule out a two-step addition involving an intermediate that collapses to product faster than it can rotate to allow for inversion of stereochemistry for intermolecular reactions especially , the preferred positional and stereochemical relationship of subtituents of the two components compared to each other are controlled by electronic effects frontier molecular orbital theory has also been used to explain the regioselectivity patterns observed in diels–alder reactions of substituted systems in general , the regioselectivity found for both normal and inverse electron-demand diels–alder reaction follows the ortho-para rule , so named , because the cyclohexene product bears substituents in positions that are analogous to the ortho and para positions of disubstituted arenes similar analyses for the corresponding inverse-demand scenarios gives rise to the analogous products as seen in cases 3 and 4 in general , with respect to the energetically most well-matched homo-lumo pair , maximizing the interaction energy by forming bonds between centers with the largest frontier orbital coefficients allows the prediction of the main regioisomer that will result from a given diene-dienophile combination for instance , in uncommon combinations involving x groups on both diene and dienophile , a 1,3-substitution pattern may be favored , an outcome not accounted for by a simplistic resonance structure argument this is a stereoselective situation based on the relative orientation of the two separate components when they react with each other in the context of the diels–alder reaction , the transition state in which the most significant substituent ( an electron-withdrawing and/or conjugating group ) on the dienophile is oriented towards the diene π system and slips under it as the reaction takes place is known as the endo transition state the diene component of the diels–alder reaction can be either open-chain or cyclic , and it can host many different types of substituents ; it must , however , be able to exist in the s-cis conformation , since this is the only conformer that can participate in the reaction the increased reactivity of these and similar dienes is a result of synergistic contributions from donor groups at c1 and c3 , raising the homo significantly above that of a comparable monosubstituted diene on the contrary , stable dienes are rather unreactive and undergo diels–alder reactions only at elevated temperatures : for example , naphthalene can function as a diene , leading to adducts only with highly reactive dienophiles , such as n-phenyl-maleimide a series of reactions then follow to transform the functionality into a desirable group the problem is that ketene itself can not be used in diels–alder reactions because it reacts with dienes in unwanted manner ( by 2+2 cycloaddition ) , and therefore '' masked functionality '' approach has to be used carbonyl groups , for example , can successfully react with dienes to yield dihydropyran rings , a reaction known as the oxo-diels–alder reaction , and imines can be used , either as the dienophile or at various sites in the diene , to form various n-heterocyclic compounds through the aza-diels–alder reaction lewis acid catalysis also enables diels–alder reactions to proceed at low temperatures , i.e this reaction allows the formation of heavily-functionalized aromatic rings in a single step corey , in his original 1969 synthesis of prostaglandins f2α and e2 , utilized a diels–alder reaction early in the synthesis to establish the relative stereochemistry of three contiguous stereocenters on the prostaglandin cyclopentane core thus activation by strongly lewis acidic cupric tetrafluoroborate was required to allow for the reaction to take place the use of 2-chloroacrylonitrile as dienophile is a viable synthetic equivalent for ketene , a structure that typically underdoes a 2+2 cycloaddition to give a cyclobutanone dimer rather than participating in diels–alder reactions with 1,3-dienes in their 1980 synthesis of reserpine , paul wender and coworkers used a diels–alder reaction to set the cis-decalin framework of the d and e rings of the natural product the intermolecular reaction of the hydroxy-pyrone and α , β–unsaturated ester shown below suffered from poor yield and regioselectivity ; however , when directed by phenylboronic acid the desired adduct could be obtained in 61 % yield after cleavage of the boronate with 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol in this way , the single allene isomer formed could direct the diels-alder to occur on only one face of the generated 'diene ' the authors note that the dienophile 's free hydroxyl group was integral to the success of the reaction , as hydroxyl-protected variants did not react under several different reaction conditions
