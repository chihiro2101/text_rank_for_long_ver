he was descended , through his mother 's side , from king john of denmark , and was thus the first descendant of king john to assume the crown since the deposition of king christian ii at the death of his father on 4 april 1588 , christian was 11 years old he succeeded to the throne , but as he was still under-age a regency council was set up to serve as the trustees of the royal power while christian was still growing up his mother queen dowager sophie , 30 years old , had wished to play a role in the government , but was denied by the council christian had to depend mainly upon hired mercenary troops as was common practice in the times—well before the establishment of standing armies—augmented by native conscription recruited for the most part from the peasantry on the crown domains to foster friendly relations between the two kingdoms , christian paid a state visit to england in 1606 the expedition set sail in 1618 , taking two years to reach ceylon and losing more than half their crew on the way review of development and change 14 ( 1 & 2 ) : 19–40 but instead the nayak of tanjore ( now thanjavur in tamil nadu ) turned out to be interested in trading opportunities and a treaty was negotiated granting the danes the village of tranquebar ( or tarangamabadi ) on india 's south coast and the right to construct a '' stone house '' ( fort dansborg ) and levy taxes christian also assigned the privilege establishing the danish east india company in 1611 , he first put his newly organised army to use christian compelled king gustavus adolphus of sweden to give way on all essential points at the resulting treaty of knäred of 20 january 1613 he now turned his attention to the thirty years ' war in germany he skillfully took advantage of the alarm of the german protestants after the battle of white mountain in 1620 , to secure co-adjutorship of the see of bremen for his son frederick ( september 1621 ) & nbsp ; 400–433 denmark 's intervention in the thirty years ' war was aided by france and by charles i of england , who agreed to help subsidise the war partly because christian was the uncle of both the stuart king and his sister elizabeth of bohemia through their mother , anne of denmark murdoch and grosjean , pp.43–46 moreover , some 6000 english troops under charles morgan also eventually arrived to bolster the defence of denmark though it took longer for these to arrive than christian hoped , not least due to the ongoing british campaigns against france and spain thus christian , as war-leader of the lower saxon circle , entered the war with an army of only 20,000 mercenaries , some of his allies from britain and a national army 15,000 strong , leading them as duke of holstein rather than as king of denmark despite the growing power of roman catholics in north germany , and the threat to the danish holdings in the schleswig-holstein duchies , christian for a time stayed his hand christian embarked on a military campaign which was later known in denmark and norway as '' the emperor war '' , christian had not thoroughly planned the advance against the combined forces of the holy roman emperor and the catholic league , as promises of military support from the netherlands and england did not materialise however , the treaty bound christian not to interfere in the thirty years ' war any further , removing any danish obstacles when gustavus adolphus entered the war in 1630 christian 's foreign policy did not suffer from lack of confidence following the danish defeat in the thirty years ' war christian contacted the roman catholic part of the thirty years ' war , and offered to broker a deal with sweden his scandinavian policy was so irritating and vexatious that swedish statesmen advocated for a war with denmark , to keep christian from interfering in the peace negotiations with the holy roman emperor , and in may 1643 , christian faced another war against sweden sweden was able , thanks to their conquests in the thirty years ' war , to attack denmark from the south as well as the east ; the dutch alliance promised to secure them at sea in may 1643 the swedish privy council decided upon war ; on 12 december the swedish field marshal lennart torstensson , advancing from bohemia , crossed the southern frontier of denmark ; and by the end of january 1644 the whole peninsula of jutland was in swedish hands another attempt to transport torstensson and his army to the danish islands by a large swedish fleet was frustrated by christian iv in person on 1 july 1644 christian iv spent more time in norway than any other oldenberg monarch and no oldenburg king made such a lasting impression on the norwegian people he visited the country a number of times and founded four cities when the king was busy overseeing the reparations and re-building of the fortress at oslo , he lived in the country all summer , and at the same time tried to establish a centre for producing iron at eiker , buskerud history tells he actually ruled the entire kingdom from this area in the summer of 1603 in 1623 , christian again visited norway for an entire summer , this time to oversee the foundation of kongsberg he was also present in the area in 1624 , when oslo burned in august of that year after the fire in 1624 which lasted for three days , christian iv decided that the old city should not be rebuilt again during the fourteenth century the swedish kings tried to push the areas of their control towards the north , and contemporary maps depicted the now norwegian coastal areas of troms and finnmark as a part of sweden christian was an agile dancer , and his court was reckoned the second most '' musical '' court in europe , only ranking behind that of elizabeth i of england christian iv is renowned for his many city ( town ) foundations , and is most likely the nordic head of state that can be accredited for the highest number of new cities in his realm the original town of christian is now known as kvadraturen the quarters he also founded the danish east india company ( asiatisk kompagni ) inspired by the similar dutch company when christian was crowned king , denmark-norway held a supremacy over the baltic sea , which was lost to sweden during the years of his reign nevertheless , christian was one of the few kings from the house of oldenburg that achieved a lasting legacy of popularity with both the danish and norwegian people christian iv is featured several times in the book series the legend of the ice people christian iv also features prominently in the novel music and silence by rose tremain , which is primarily set in and around the danish court in the years 1629 and 1630 christian iv is depicted as a foul-natured person , but a good king who did a lot to make his realm flourish , by the danish alternative music band mew in their song , '' king christian '' in 1632 an english envoy to king christian iv , then aged 55 , primly remarked : '' such is the life of that king : to drink all day and to lie with a whore every night ''
