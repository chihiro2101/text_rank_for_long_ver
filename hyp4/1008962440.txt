) using this guideline , to achieve the 80-bit strength recommended for high security ( non-military ) by nist , a passphrase would need to be 58 characters long , assuming a composition that includes uppercase and alphanumeric if the words or components of a passphrase may be found in a language dictionary—especially one available as electronic input to a software program—the passphrase is rendered more vulnerable to dictionary attack however , the required effort ( in time and cost ) can be made impracticably high if there are enough words in the passphrase and how randomly they are chosen and ordered in the passphrase these are difficult conditions to meet , and selecting at least one word that can not be found in any dictionary significantly increases passphrase strength on the other hand , user-selected passwords tend to be much weaker than that and encouraging users to use even 2-word passphrases may be able to raise entropy from below 10 bits to over 20 bits such passwords may be adequate for various applications ( if frequently changed , if chosen using an appropriate policy , if not found in dictionaries , if sufficiently random , and/or if the system prevents online guessing , etc typical advice about choosing a passphrase includes suggestions that it should be : long enough to be hard to guess not a famous quotation from literature , holy books , et cetera hard to guess by intuition—even by someone who knows the user well easy to remember and type accurately for better security , any easily memorable encoding at the user 's own level can be applied one method to create a strong passphrase is to use dice to select words at random from a long list , a technique often referred to as diceware while such a collection of words might appear to violate the '' not from any dictionary '' rule , the security is based entirely on the large number of possible ways to choose from the list of words and not from any secrecy about the words themselves individuals and organizations serious about cracking computer security have compiled lists of passwords derived in this manner from the most common quotations , song lyrics , and so on another supplementary approach to frustrating brute-force attacks is to derive the key from the passphrase using a key derivation function , such as pbkdf2 as described in rfc 2898
