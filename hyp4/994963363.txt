a study using a monkey as a subject shows that it is possible to directly use commands from the brain , bypass the spinal cord and enable hand function also , for the procedure to be practical , the age of the donated body must be sufficient : an adult brain can not fit into a skull that has not reached its full growth , which occurs at age 9â€“12 years the whole-body transplant is just one of several means of putting a consciousness into a new body that have been explored in science fiction once the brain transplant has been completed , the white person 's consciousness takes control over the black host body ; meanwhile , the consciousness of the black person remains in the sunken place jones professeur jameson stories ( 1931 ) , the main character is the last earthman , whose brain is saved by some alien cyborgs called the zoromes , and is inserted into a robotic body , making him immortal lestat demands that the procedure be used on him to allow him to be human once again , but soon finds that he has made an error and is forced to recapture james in his vampiric form so he can take his body back while the ultimate goal of transplanting is transfer of the brain to a new body optimized for it by genetics , proteomics , and/or other medical procedures , in uploading the brain itself moves nowhere and may even be physically destroyed or discarded ; the goal is rather to duplicate the information patterns contained within the brain another similar literary theme , though different from either procedure described above , is the transplanting of a human brain into an artificial , usually robotic , body
