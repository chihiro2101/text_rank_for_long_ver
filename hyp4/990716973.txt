at north american , he worked on north american 's failed proposal to build the submersible alvin for the woods hole oceanographic institution subsequently , he returned to andreas rechnitzer 's ocean systems group at north american aviation after leaving active duty and entering into the naval reserve in 1970 , ballard continued working at woods hole persuading organizations and people , mostly scientists , to fund and use alvin for undersea research it used an air gun that sent sound waves underwater to determine the underlying structure of the ocean floor and the submersible alvin , which was used to find and recover a sample from the bedrock the 1979 rise project expedition on the east pacific rise west of mexico at 21°n was aided by deep-towed still camera sleds that were able to take pictures of the ocean floor , making it easier to find hydrothermal vent locations while ballard had been interested in the sea since an early age , his work at woods hole and his scuba diving experiences off massachusetts spurred his interest in shipwrecks and their exploration however , they were interested in finding out what happened to their missing submarines and ultimately concluded that argo was their best chance to do so the navy agreed it would finance his titanic search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines , and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for such a long time , and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment after the two missions were completed , time and funding permitting , he was free to use resources to hunt for the titanic when they searched for the two submarines , ballard and his team discovered that they had imploded from the immense pressure at depth following the large trail of debris led them directly to both and made it significantly easier for them to locate them than if they were to search for the hulls directly he already knew that the titanic imploded from pressure as well , much the same way the two submarines did , and concluded that it too must have also left a scattered debris trail they took shifts monitoring the video feed from argo as it searched the ocean floor two miles below ballard 's team made a general search of the titanic 's exterior , noting its condition on july 12 , 1986 , ballard and his team returned on board atlantis ii to make the first detailed study of the wreck it was accompanied by jason junior , a small remotely operated vehicle that could fit through small openings to see into the ship 's interior although the first dive ( taking over two hours ) encountered technical problems , subsequent ones were far more successful , and produced a detailed photographic record of the wreck 's condition in 1988 , ballard published a book , discovery of the titanic : exploring the greatest of all lost ships , and he later recounted the specifics of the expedition for national geographic in a video in late august 2018 , the groups vying for ownership of the 5,500 relics included one by museums in england and northern ireland with assistance from film maker james cameron and some financial support from national geographic the discovery was also documented for national geographic in a 1989 james cameron video search for the battleship bismarck which indicated that the ship had been damaged by torpedoes and shells from british ships the actual cause of the sinking , however , was sabotage of the underwater valves by the onboard crew , according to ballard , who said , '' we found a hull that appears whole and relatively undamaged by the descent and impact '' film maker cameron , however , said that his crew 's examination of the wreckage indicated that the bismarck would have sunk eventually even if it had not been scuttled it had been struck by a torpedo , whose explosion was followed by a second , much larger one the wreck had been depth charged by the royal navy several years after the sinking , and had also been damaged by other explorers , making a forensic analysis difficult in 1992 , ballard and his team visited the sites of many wrecks of world war ii in the pacific in a series of expeditions , a team of marine archaeologists led by ballard identified what appeared to be ancient shorelines , freshwater snail shells , and drowned river valleys in roughly 300 feet ( 100 m ) of water off the black sea coast of modern turkey in 2000 , the team conducted an expedition that focused on the exploration of the sea bed about 15–30 & nbsp ; km west of sinop , and an additional deep-water survey east and north of the peninsula they sought to discover whether human habitation sites could be identified on the ancient submerged landscape , they examined the sea-bed for shipwrecks ( where they found sinop a-d ) , to test the hypothesis that the anoxic waters below 200 m would protect shipwrecks from the expected biological attacks on organic components , and to seek data about an ancient trade route between sinop and the crimea indicated by terrestrial archaeological remains the wreck found provided the team with vast information about both the technological changes and trade that occurred in the black sea during a period of political , social and economic transition through their study of the ship 's construction techniques , 2001 , black sea coastal cultures : trade and interaction , expedition 43 : 11–20 the examination of the four shipwrecks found by ballard and his team provide the direct evidence for black sea maritime trade so well attested by the distribution of ceramics on land the team 's visit to the site was short and was intended primarily to test survey methodology for deep-water procedures shipwreck d provided the team with an unprecedented opportunity to document hull construction during a time of transition there was evidence for a strong flow of fresh water out of the black sea in the 8th millennium bc he began the jason project in response to the thousands of letters he received from students following his discovery of the wreck of the titanic .
