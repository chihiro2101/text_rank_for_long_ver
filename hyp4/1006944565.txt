'' conolly believed that rawlinson 's new post gave him the opportunity to advance humanitarianism in afghanistan , and summed up his hopes : if the british government would only play the grand game – help russia cordially to all that she has a right to expect – shake hands with persia – get her all possible amends from uzbeks – force the bukhara amir to be just to us , the afghans , and other oosbeg states , and his own kingdom – but why go on ; you know my , at any rate in one sense , enlarged views the use of the term '' the great game '' to describe anglo-russian rivalry in central asia became common only after the second world war at the start of the 19th century , the indian subcontinent was ruled in part by independent princely states and in part by the company rule of the british east india company during the 19th century a political and diplomatic confrontation developed between britain and russia over afghanistan which later became known as '' the great game '' russia was fearful of british commercial and military inroads into central asia , and britain was fearful of russia adding the '' jewel in the crown '' , india , to the vast empire that russia was building in asia if russia were to gain control of the emirate of afghanistan , it might then be used as a staging post for a russian invasion of india in 1801 paul , fearing a future action by the british against russia and her allies in europe , decided to make the first move towards where he believed the british empire was weakest however , britain was left with concerns about being able to defend india the expedition was funded by the east india company and was to map and research the regions of '' beloochistan '' ( balochistan ) and persia because of concerns about india being invaded by french forces from that direction britain had no intention of getting involved in the middle east , but it did envision a series of buffer states between the british and russian empires that included turkey , persia , plus the khanate of khiva and the khanate of bukhara that would grow from future trade afghanistan would need to be transformed from a group of warring principalities into one state ruled by an ally whose foreign relations would be conducted on his behalf by the governor-general and the foreign office the great game meant closer ties between britain and the states along her northwest frontier from then until the mid-19th century , russian ambassadors to the region spent much of their time trying to free russians who had been taken as slaves by the khanates russia would later expand across siberia to the far east , where it reached the pacific port that would become known as vladivostok by 1859 this eastward expansion was of no concern to the british foreign office because this area did not lie across any british trade routes or destinations , and therefore was of no interest to britain this raised russo-khivan tensions in addition to khiva 's legal discrimination of russian merchants who were just beginning to penetrate central asia , and the ongoing issue of russian slaves russia feared the influence that a muslim power with british support might have on the other khanates in the region however , after 1830 , britain 's commercial and diplomatic interest to the north-west would eventually become formidable in 1831 , captain alexander burnes and colonel henry pottinger 's surveys of the indus river would prepare the way for a future assault on the sind to clear a path towards central asia burnes , a christian travelling through a muslim country was one of the first to study afghanistan for british intelligence and upon his return , he published his book , travels to bukhara , which became an overnight success in 1834 the india board instructed auckland : to watch more closely than has hitherto been attempted the progress of events in afghanistan , and to counteract the progress of russian influence.the mode of dealing with this very important question , whether by dispatching a confidential agent to dost mohammed of kabul merely to watch the progress of events , or to enter into relations with this chief , either of a political or merely in the first instance of a commercial character , we confide in your discretion as well as the adoption of any other measures that may appear to you desirable to counteract russian influence in that quarter , should you be satisfied.that the time has arrived at which it would be right for you to interfere decidedly in the affairs of afghanistan russia feared british inroads on their commerce in central asia , as well as the influence that a muslim power with british support might have on the other khanates additionally , persia intended to annex herat to make up for territory it had lost in the russo-persian war ( 1826–28 ) , however the allegiance of herat to afghanistan was crucial to the british strategy britain threatened to take military action and persia withdrew in september in october 1838 auckland issued the simla manifesto , a piece of propaganda designed to blacken the reputation of dost mohammad khan ( emir of afghanistan ) and which claimed that dost mohammad : openly threatened.to call in every foreign aid that he could command.we could never hope that the tranquility of our neighborhood could be secured.the governor-general confidently hopes that the shah will speedily be replaced on his throne.the independence and integrity of afghanistan restored , the british army will be withdrawn british influence was to be extended into afghanistan and it was to become a buffer state shah shuja ul-mulk had ascended the throne in 1803 and had signed a mutual defence agreement with the british in 1809 against a possible franco-russian invasion of india via afghanistan the attempted russian assault on khiva may have been in response to britain 's '' forward policy '' on afghanistan , however it failed to reach khiva due to the severe winter conditions following the indian rebellion of 1857 , the east india company 's remaining powers were transferred to the british crown in the person of queen victoria ( who in 1876 was proclaimed emperor of india ) the government of india act 1858 saw the india office of the british government assume the administration of british india through a viceroy appointed by the crown the new and wary alexander ii of russia waited some years so as not to antagonize the british , then russia expanded into central asia in two campaigns the agreement was regarded as having defined the british and russian spheres of influence in afghanistan and central asia , gave the two sides the legitimacy to advance within their designated zones , created cordial relations between the two rival european powers , and raised the new problem of defining what were the frontiers of afghanistan , russia and china in the upper oxus region in the pamir mountains the agreement was negotiated by russian diplomat prince alexander gorchakov , the lands of badakhshan and wakhan were accepted by russia as part of afghanistan , russia accepted all of britain 's proposals on afghanistan 's northern borders and expected that britain would keep afghanistan from committing any aggression lord lytton , the viceroy of british india , ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for kabul in september 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the khyber pass , triggering the second anglo–afghan war in the following years , other tribal areas would be annexed by the british as the russian forces were close to herat , the british and russian governments formed a joint anglo-russian afghan boundary commission in the same year to define the borders between the russian empire and northern afghanistan the afghan boundary commission was supposed to have settled the dispute , however the battle occurred before its arrival britain did not aid afghanistan as was required by the treaty of gandamak , leading the amir to believe that he could not rely on the british in the face of russian aggression germany had no direct stakes , however its dominance of europe was enhanced when russian troops were based as far away from germany as possible over two decades , 1871–1890 , he maneuvered to help the british , hoping to force the russians to commit more soldiers
