originally the software , including an operating system and a fortran compiler , were done under contract by computer usage company , under direction of george r the asc was based around a single high-speed shared memory , which was accessed by the cpu and eight i/o channel controllers , in an organization similar to seymour cray 's groundbreaking cdc 6600 the mcu was a two-way , 256-bit per channel parallel network that could support up to eight independent processors , with a ninth channel for accessing '' main memory '' ( referred to as '' extended memory '' ) the mcu also acted as a cache controller , offering high-speed access to a semiconductor-based memory for the eight processor ports , and handling all communications to the 24-bit address space in main memory for instance , main memory could be constructed out of slower but less expensive core memory , although this was not used in practice this remains a major problem on modern simd designs as well , which is why considerable effort has been put into increasing memory throughput in modern computer designs ( although largely unsuccessfully ) the '' peripheral processor '' was a separate system dedicated entirely to quickly running the operating system and programs running within it , as well as feeding data to the cpu each vp had its own program counter and registers , and the system could thus run eight programs at the same time , limited only by memory accesses keeping eight programs running allowed the system to shuffle execution of programs on the cpu depending on what data was available on the memory bus at that time , minimizing '' dead time '' where the cpu had to wait for data from the memory the cray-1 dedicated almost all of its design to sustained high-speed access to memory , including over one million 64-bit words of semiconductor memory and a cycle time that was one-fifth that of the asc ( 12.5 & nbsp ; ns ) the asc 1 prototype was a one pipe system and brought up in austin , texas , off site from ti 's main plant for proprietary information reasons
