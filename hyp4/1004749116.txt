because frames are compressed independently of one another , m-jpeg imposes lower processing and memory requirements on hardware devices for quicktime formats , apple has defined two types of coding : mjpeg-a and mjpeg-b since the development of the original jpeg standard in the early 1990s , technology improvements have been made not only to the jpeg format but to the interframe compression schemas possible as well it tolerates rapidly changing motion in the video stream , whereas compression schemes using interframe compression can often experience unacceptable quality loss when the video content changes significantly between each frame unlike the video formats specified in international standards such as mpeg-2 and the format specified in the jpeg still-picture coding standard , there is no document that defines a single exact format that is universally recognized as a complete specification of “ motion jpeg ” for use in all contexts however , each particular file format usually has some standard on how m-jpeg is encoded modern desktop cpus are powerful enough to work with high-definition video , so no special hardware is required , and they in turn offer native random-access to any frame prior to the recent rise in mpeg-4 encoding in consumer devices , a progressive scan form of m-jpeg saw widespread use in the “ movie ” modes of digital still cameras , allowing video encoding and playback through the integrated jpeg compression hardware with only a software modification this video is typically stored in the popular windows avi or apple quicktime mov container files , generally viewable natively ( or after installation of a simple codec ) in most versions of the applicable operating system in addition to portable players ( which are mainly '' consumers '' of the video ) , many video-enabled digital cameras use m-jpeg for video-capture some network-enabled cameras provide their own m-jpeg interfaces as part of the normal feature set for cameras that do n't provide this feature natively , a server can be used to transcode the camera pictures into an m-jpeg stream and then provide that stream to other network clients a special mime-type content type multipart/x-mixed-replace ; boundary informs the client to expect several parts ( frames ) as an answer delimited by
