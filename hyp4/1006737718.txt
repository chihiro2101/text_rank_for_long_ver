in an election using the additional member system , each voter casts two votes : a vote for a candidate standing in their constituency ( with or without an affiliated party ) , and a vote for a party list standing in a wider region made up of multiple constituencies the constituency vote is used to elect a single representative in the voter 's constituency using the traditional first past the post system : the candidate plurality ( voting ) ( not necessarily a majority of the electorate ) wins the regional vote is used to elect representatives from party lists to stand in regional seats , taking into account how many seats were gained by that party in the constituency vote , using a system of proportional representation : the number of seats a party receives will roughly reflect its percentage of the vote with a similar model in bavaria the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party 's regional list and both votes count for party and candidates so that every vote counts : bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose as in many systems containing or based upon party-list representation , in order to be eligible for list seats in some ams models , a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote , or no candidates will be elected from the party list since smaller parties are likely , in compensatory systems , to win a larger number of proportional seats , such additional member systems could hand additional political power to the leaders of these parties at the expense of regional directly elected representatives , unless the additional members are elected on an open regional list or a closed regional list as in scotland and wales the largest party in an election is likely to win a smaller number of proportional seats , so that governing parties may lose diversity , unless the members elected from the party list when it was in opposition then win local seats when the party gains enough support to form the government it was used from 1993 to 2005 in italy : the chamber of deputies , even if decoy lists changed de facto the electoral system into a pure parallel voting the italian senate , with a particular single-vote variant : proportional representation was automatically calculated upon all losers in the fptp races , and candidates with best percentages were elected in 1976 , the hansard society recommended that a mixed electoral system in a form different from the german be used for uk parliamentary elections , but instead of using closed party lists , it proposed that seats be filled by the '' best runner-up '' basis used by the german state of baden-w√ºrttemberg , where the compensatory seats are filled by the party 's defeated candidates who were the 'best near-winner ' in each of the state 's four regions the system implemented for the scottish parliament is known to make it more difficult for any one party to win an outright majority , compared to the first-past-the-post system used for general elections to the uk parliament in westminster the british government announced on 22 november 2006 that the two separate ballot papers used in the previous scottish parliament elections would be replaced for the elections in may 2007 by a single paper , with the left side listing the parties standing for election as regional msps and the right side the candidates standing as constituency msps .
