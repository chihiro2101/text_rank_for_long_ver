the name of the people of bashkort has been known since the 10th century , most researchers etymologize the name as '' main/leader/head '' ( bash ) + '' wolf '' ( qort , old archaic word for the animal ) , thus '' wolf-leader '' ( from the totemic hero ancestor ) by the folk interpretation in fact , the name seems to come from the legend regarding the migration of the first seven bashkir tribes from the syr-darya valley to the volga-ural region , the legend chants that the bashkirs , who dwelled in the arid syr-darya , were committed to the goddess of fertility of tengrism , ( referred as umay ) , umay , in order to reward them for their loyality , decided to donate them a prosperous , green , fertile land , protected by the legendary ural mountains ( in alignement with the famous bashkir epic poem '' ural-batyr '' ) , a wolf was sent to guide these tribes to their promised land , therefore the tribes followed the wolf , thus '' bash-qort '' ( '' head/lead ( ing ) '' + '' wolf '' ) alektorov ( 1885 ) suggested that bashqort meant '' distinct nation '' baskakov believed the term : '' bashqort '' to have consisted of two parts : '' badz ( a ) '' – brother-in-law '' and '' ( o ) gur '' meaning : '' brothers-in-law of the ugor magyars '' bikbulatov suggested that the term originated from the name of a legendary khazar warlord named bashgird , who ruled an area centred on the yayıq river the formation of the bashkir people was played by turkic tribes of south siberian central asian origin , who , before migrating to the southern urals , wandered for a considerable time in the syr darya steppes modern day central-southern kazakhstan , coming into contact with the pechenegs and kimak-kipchak tribes therefore it is possible to note that the bashkir people originates from the same tribes which compose the modern kazakhs , kyrgyzes and nogais , but there has been a considerable cultural and a small ethnic exchange with oghuz tribes the migration to the valley of the southern urals happened between the end of the 9th century and the beginning of the 10th century , in parallel to the great kipchak migration to the north the first report about bashkirs might have been found in the chinese chronicle book of sui : around 40 turkic tiele tribes were named ( 636 ad ) in '' a narration about the tiele people '' ; bashkirs might have included within that narration : if the tribal name 比干 ( mandarin bǐgān x -kɑn ) were read as 比千 ( bĭqiān x t͡sʰen ) , according to chinese scholar rui chuanming in the 7th century , bashkirs are also mentioned in '' ashkharatsuyts '' the book of sui might be speaking about the precursors of these tribes when the turkic peoples were still wandering in south siberia from the 9th century , during the migration of the bashkirs to the volga-ural , the first arab and persian written reports about bashkirs commence the traveller sallam an at-tardzhuman visited bashkir lands and wrote in circa 840 the first written arab source on the bashkirs and a rough description of its borders in the 10th century , persian abu zayd al-balkhi ( 10th century ) described bashkirs as a people divided into two groups : one inhabiting the southern urals , the other living on the danube plain near the boundaries of byzantium ( these sources may have confused bashkirs with hungarians , since the area of modern bashkortostan is often referred as '' magna hungaria '' , the zone where the magyar tribes dwelled before their migration to europe ; it is believed that bashkirs may have come into contact with these magyar tribes , since some of the northern tribes of the modern bashkirs do have genetic correspondence with hungarians ) the bashkirs , according to ibn fadlan , were a warlike and powerful people , which he and his companions ( a total of five thousand people , including military protection ) '' bewared apparently , islam had already begun to spread among the bashkirs , as one of the ambassadors was a muslim bashkir primary documents pertaining to the bashkirs during this period have been lost , although some are mentioned in the shezhere ( family trees ) of the bashkir during the russian imperial period , russians and tatars began to migrate to bashkortostan which led to eventual demographic changes in the region russians had discussed from the times of peter the great a desire to expand russian sovereignty south-east toward persia and india the consequence of the aral sea fort would involve crossing bashkir and the little jüz lands , some of whom had recently offered a nominal submission to the russian crown the war consisted of many small raids and complex troop movements , so it can not be easily summarized although the history of the 1735 bashkir war can not be easily summarized , its results were : the russian imperial goal of expansion into central asia was delayed to deal with bashkir resistance in 1740 a report was made of bashkir losses which listed : killed : 16,893 ; sent to baltic regiments and fleet : 3,236 ; women & children distributed ( presumably as serfs ) : 8,382 with a grand total of 28,511 in 1786 , the bashkirs achieved tax-free status ; and in 1798 russia formed an irregular bashkir army from among them the dutch and the germans called the bashkirs '' northern amurs '' , probably because the population was not aware of who the bashkirs actually were or where they came from , therefore the usage of '' amurs '' in the name may be associated to a reference of something or someone coming from far away ; these battalions were considered as the liberators from the french , however modern russian military sources do not give credit to the bashkirs for these accomplishments this effectively makes bashkortostan the first ever democracy turkic republic in history and the first ever nation to rise against the russian empire after the revolution the newborn independent bashkortostan had to quickly form its own armed forces in order to protect itself from both the red and white army , zeki velidi togan managed to get the formal support of the basmachi movement , however , the position of the republic between the white and red armies played in disadvantage of the bashkir armed forces , successively , the republic fell violently to the control of the red army , resulting into a massacre of ethnic bashkirs committed by the predominantly russian red army battalions the orenburg bashkir qoroltays were not considered sufficiently politically orthodox by the soviet government , therefore the orenburg area was separated from the bashkir assr , a separate council was put in charge of the area ( the orenburg soviet ) however , even after the separation , the bolsheviks and stalin , who was in charge of nationalities in the new communist regime , considered even the red bashkirs as too separatist , therefore they attempted to set up a great idel-ural soviet , merging bashkirs with idel tatars and chuvashes the bolsheviks did expect the bashkirs to revolt , therefore all the red bashkir soldiers were sent to fight far away from their homeland as precautionary measure so they could not help their civilian population against the red terror and had to give up their dream of freedom and independence a group of bashkirs from the burzyansky and abzelilovsky districts of the republic of bashkortostan in the idel-ural region who belong to the r1a subclade r-sur51 are the closest kin of the hungarian árpád dynasty , from which got separated 2000 years ago this archaic version of a bashkir language would be more or less a dialect of the proto-kipchak language , however , since then , the bashkir language has been through a series of vowel and consonant shifts , which are a result of a common literary history shared with the idel tatar language since the formation of the cumania , when the volga bulgaria started to receive kipchaks influence and became the tatars , most likely between the 10th and 11th centuries from an ark of time of roughly 900 years , the bashkir language and idel tatar language , previously being completely different languages , '' melted '' into a series of dialects of a common volga turki language , the idel tatars and bashkirs tough are and always were two peoples of completely different origins , cultures and identities , but because of a shared common literary history in an ark of 900 years , the two languages ended up in a common language , spoken in different dialects with features depending on the people which spoke them at the beginning of the 20th century , most notably during the russian revolution , when bashkortostan and tatarstan became two different republics which rose up against the russian empire in an attempt to achieve independence , the bashkir and idel tatar language were defined as two separate literary languages , each of them based on the most distinct dialects of the volga kipchak language spoken by the bashkir and idel tatar people the bashkir language was considered endangered but recent bashkir nationalism has made many develop an interest in it the combination of encouragement by local authorities and renewed bashkir language interest among bashkirs have greatly assisted the language to stay relevant the bashkirs have created a rich folklore associated with their early period of history some of these poems became important on a continental level , for example the poem of the '' ural-batyr '' , which tells the tale of the legendary hero ural , is the origin of the name of the ural mountains , the natural border between europe and asia other poems constitute a great part of the bashkir national identity , other tales apart from the ural batyr are '' akbuzat '' , '' qara yurga '' , '' aqhaq qola '' , '' kongur buga '' , '' uzaq tuzaq '' , and many others frank , '' islamic historiography and '' bulghar '' identity among the tatars and bashkirs '' , brill , 1998 the final assertion of islam among the bashkirs occurred in the 1320s and 1330s during the golden horde period
