in this case , the hosts most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network , such as e-mail , web and domain name system ( dns ) servers similarly , communication between hosts in the dmz and to the external network is also restricted to make the dmz more secure than the internet and suitable for housing these special purpose services this allows hosts in the dmz to communicate with both the internal and external network , while an intervening firewall controls the traffic between the dmz servers and the internal network clients , and another firewall would perform some level of control to protect the dmz from the external network ) any service that is being provided to users on the external network can be placed in the dmz instead of providing a service to internal users wanting to access an external network , it provides indirect access for an external network ( usually the internet ) to internal resources for example , a back office application access , such as an email system , could be provided to external users ( to read emails while outside the company ) but the remote user would not have direct access to their email server ( only the reverse proxy server can physically access the internal email server ) this is an extra layer of security particularly recommended when internal resources need to be accessed from the outside , but it 's worth noting this design still allows remote ( and potentially malicious ) users to talk to the internal resources with the help of the proxy usually such a reverse proxy mechanism is provided by using an application layer firewall that focuses on the specific shape and contents of the traffic rather than just controlling access to specific tcp and udp ports ( as a packet filter firewall would do ) , but a reverse proxy is usually not a good substitute for a well thought out dmz design as it has to rely on continuous signature updates for updated attack vectors a single firewall with at least 3 network interfaces can be used to create a network architecture containing a dmz the second firewall ( also called '' back-end '' or '' internal '' firewall ) only allows traffic to the dmz from the internal network that is , the dmz host is able to connect to other hosts on the internal network , whereas hosts within a real dmz are prevented from connecting with the internal network by a firewall that separates them unless the firewall permits the connection the dmz host provides none of the security advantages that a subnet provides and is often used as an easy method of forwarding all ports to another firewall / nat device
