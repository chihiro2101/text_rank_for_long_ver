most of what was then known about electricity and magnetism , however , could be explained on the basis that charge is a continuous variable ; in much the same way that many of the properties of light can be explained by treating it as a continuous wave rather than as a stream of photons by applying a potential difference across the plates , a uniform electric field was created in the space between them the field is then turned on and , if it is large enough , some of the drops ( the charged ones ) will start to rise a likely looking drop is selected and kept in the middle of the field of view by alternately switching off the voltage until all the other drops have fallen the experiment is then continued with this one drop holton suggested these data points were omitted from the large set of oil drops measured in his experiments without apparent reason this enabled millikan to claim that he had calculated e to better than one half of one percent ; in fact , if millikan had included all of the data he had thrown out , the standard error of the mean would have been within 2 % while this would still have resulted in millikan having measured e better than anyone else at the time , the slightly larger uncertainty might have allowed more disagreement with his results within the physics community reasons for a failure to generate a complete observation include annotations regarding the apparatus setup , oil drop production , and atmospheric effects which invalidated , in millikan 's opinion ( borne out by the reduced error in this set ) , a given particular measurement the difference is less than one percent , but is six times greater than millikan 's standard error , so the disagreement is significant .
