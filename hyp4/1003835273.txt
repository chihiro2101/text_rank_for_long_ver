the esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system many blood vessels serve the esophagus , with blood supply varying along its course the upper parts of the esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery , the parts of the esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial artery and branches directly from the thoracic aorta , and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery the upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins , and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein in addition , sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction normally , the cardia of the stomach is immediately distal to the z-line and the z-line coincides with the upper limit of the gastric folds of the cardia ; however , when the anatomy of the mucosa is distorted in barrets esophagus the true gastro-eshophageal junction can be identified by the upper limit of the gastric folds rather than the mucosal transition there are two types of glands , with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa , and esophageal cardiac glands , similar to cardiac glands of the stomach , located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ the muscular layer of the esophagus has two types of muscle muscle is arranged in two layers : one in which the muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus , and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus the enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract , such as the esophagus , stomach , and intestines the esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract these rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth , and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of epithelium this is most common in developed countries in those with barrett 's esophagus , and occurs in the cuboidal cells when severe , esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus , making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss the progress of the cancer is tnm staging that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded , how many lymph nodes are affected , and whether there are any metastases in different parts of the body these blood vessels are engorged more than normal , and in the worst cases may partially obstruct the esophagus these blood vessels develop as part of a collateral circulation that occurs to drain blood from the abdomen as a result of portal hypertension , usually as a result of liver diseases such as cirrhosis this collateral circulation occurs because the lower part of the esophagus drains into the left gastric vein , which is a branch of the portal vein several disorders affect the motility of food as it travels down the esophagus achalasia refers to a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly , and generally develops later in life such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions two of the most common congenital malformations affecting the esophagus are an esophageal atresia where the esophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach ; and an esophageal fistula â€“ an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea half of these cases may be part of a syndrome where other abnormalities are also present , particularly of the heart or limbs by 1908 , an operation had been performed by voeckler to remove the esophagus , and in 1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower esophagus , ( to control esophageal cancer ) , had been conducted in the majority of vertebrates , the esophagus is simply a connecting tube , but in some birds , which regurgitate components to feed their young , it is extended towards the lower end to form a crop for storing food before it enters the true stomach in ruminants , animals with four stomachs , a groove called the sulcus reticuli is often found in the esophagus , allowing milk to drain directly into the hind stomach , the abomasum the esophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where horses may suffer from the condition known as choke in most fish , the esophagus is extremely short , primarily due to the length of the pharynx ( which is associated with the gills ) however , some fish , including lampreys , chimaeras , and lungfish , have no true stomach , so that the esophagus effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine , and is therefore somewhat longer the muscle of the esophagus in many mammals is striated initially , but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so in terms of the digestive system of gastropods , the mouth opens into an esophagus , which connects to the stomach because of torsion , which is the rotation of the main body of the animal during larval development , the esophagus usually passes around the stomach , and opens into its back , furthest from the mouth in species that have undergone de-torsion , however , the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach , which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement
