the latter is obtained by the treatment of magnesium chloride solutions , typically seawater , with limewater or milk of lime high temperatures 1500 – 2000 & nbsp ; °c diminish the available surface area and produces dead-burned ( often called dead burnt ) magnesia , an unreactive form used as a refractory although some decomposition of the carbonate to oxide occurs at temperatures below 700 & nbsp ; °c , the resulting materials appears to reabsorb carbon dioxide from the air as a construction material , magnesium oxide wallboards have several attractive characteristics : fire resistance , termite resistance , moisture resistance , mold and mildew resistance , and strength magnesium oxide is used extensively in the soil and groundwater remediation , wastewater treatment , drinking water treatment , air emissions treatment , and waste treatment industries for its acid buffering capacity and related effectiveness in stabilizing dissolved heavy metal species many heavy metals species , such as lead and cadmium are most soluble in water at acidic ph ( below 6 ) as well as high ph ( above 11 ) most metal species are toxic to humans at certain concentrations , therefore it is imperative to minimize metal bioavailability and mobility granular mgo is often blended into metals-contaminated soil or waste material , which is also commonly of a low ( acidic ) ph , in order to drive the ph into the 8–10 range where most metals are at their lowest solubilities mgo is widely regarded as the most effective metals stabilization compound when compared to portland cement , lime , kiln dust products , power generation waste products , and various proprietary products due to mgo 's superior buffering capacity , cost effectiveness , and ease/safety of handling most , if not all products that are marketed as metals stabilization technologies create very high ph conditions in aquifers whereas mgo creates an ideal aquifer condition with a ph of 8–10 additionally , magnesium , an essential element to most biological systems , is provided to soil and groundwater microbial populations during mgo-assisted metals remediation as an added benefit the electrical heating industry also experimented with aluminium oxide , but it is not used anymore owing to the crystalline structure of its thin films , which can be deposited by magnetron sputtering , for example , it shows characteristics superior to those of the commonly used amorphous al 2 o 3
