many stone engravings from the nordic stone age and in particular the nordic bronze age , depict ships in various situations and valuable ships were sacrificed as part of ceremonial votive offerings since at least the nordic iron age , as evidenced by the hjortspring and nydam mose throughout the first millennium , respectable viking chieftains and their relatives were commonly buried with an intact , luxurious ship to transport them in the afterlife furthermore , the hedeby coins , among the earliest known danish currency , have impressions of ships as emblems , showing the importance of naval vessels in the area through such cultural and practical significance , the viking ship progressed into the most powerful , advanced naval vessel in viking age europe a faering is an open rowboat with two pairs of oars , commonly found in most boat-building traditions in western and northern scandinavia , dating back to the viking age the longship 's design evolved over many years , beginning in the stone age with the invention of the umiak and continuing up to the 9th century with the nydam and kvalsund ships the ship 's shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one meter deep and permitted beach landings , while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages longships were also double-ended , the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around ; this trait proved particularly useful in northern latitudes where icebergs and sea ice posed hazards to navigation later versions sported a rectangular sail on a single mast which was used to replace or augment the effort of the rowers , particularly during long journeys in the tenth century , these boats would sometimes be tied together in battle to form a steady platform for infantry warfare remarkably large vessels could be constructed using traditional clinker construction furthermore , during the early viking age , oar ports replaced rowlocks , allowing oars to be stored while the ship was at sail and to provide better angles for rowing however , in order to sail in ocean waters , the vikings needed to develop methods of relatively precise navigation most commonly , a ship 's pilot drew on traditional knowledge to guide the ship 's path essentially , the vikings simply used prior familiarity with tides , sailing times , and landmarks in order to route courses ship burial is an ancient tradition in scandinavia , stretching back to at least the nordic iron age , as evidenced by the hjortspring boat ( 400–300 bc ) or the nydam mose ( 200–450 ad ) , for example ships and bodies of water have held major spiritual importance in the norse cultures since at least the nordic bronze age several original viking ships have been found through the ages , but only a few have been relatively intact and subsequently preserved there are a considerable number of modern reconstructions of viking age ships in service around northern europe and north america
