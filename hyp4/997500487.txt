) the operation of a thyristor can be understood in terms of a pair of tightly coupled bipolar junction transistors , arranged to cause a self-latching action : : thyristors have three states : reverse blocking mode – voltage is applied in the direction that would be blocked by a diode forward blocking mode – voltage is applied in the direction that would cause a diode to conduct , but the thyristor has not been triggered into conduction forward conducting mode – the thyristor has been triggered into conduction and will remain conducting until the forward current drops below a threshold value known as the '' holding current '' once avalanche breakdown has occurred , the thyristor continues to conduct , irrespective of the gate voltage , until : ( a ) the potential v ak is removed or ( b ) the current through the device ( anode−cathode ) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer a thyristor can be switched off if the external circuit causes the anode to become negatively biased ( a method known as natural , or line , commutation ) an earlier gas-filled tube device called a thyratron provided a similar electronic switching capability , where a small control voltage could switch a large current thyristors are mainly used where high currents and voltages are involved , and are often used to control alternating currents , where the change of polarity of the current causes the device to switch off automatically , referred to as '' zero cross '' operation the device can be said to operate synchronously ; being that , once the device is triggered , it conducts current in phase with the voltage applied over its cathode to anode junction with no further gate modulation being required , i.e they can also be found in power supplies for digital circuits , where they are used as a sort of '' enhanced circuit breaker '' to prevent a failure in the power supply from damaging downstream components a thyristor is used in conjunction with a zener diode attached to its gate , and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the zener voltage , the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground ( in general also tripping an upstream breaker or fuse ) this kind of protection circuit is known as a crowbar , and has the advantage over a standard circuit breaker or fuse in that it creates a high-conductance path to ground for the damaging supply voltage and potentially for stored energy in the system being powered the stabilized high voltage dc supply for the receiver was obtained by moving the switching point of the thyristor device up and down the falling slope of the positive going half of the ac supply input ( if the rising slope was used the output voltage would always rise towards the peak input voltage when the device was triggered and thus defeat the aim of regulation ) the precise switching point was determined by the load on the dc output supply , as well as ac input fluctuations since modern thyristors can switch power on the scale of megawatts , thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current ( hvdc ) conversion either to or from alternating current because of this , use of triacs with ( for example ) heavily inductive motor loads usually requires the use of a '' snubber '' circuit around the triac to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power inverse parallel scrs can also be used in place of the triac ; because each scr in the pair has an entire half-cycle of reverse polarity applied to it , the scrs , unlike triacs , are sure to turn off although thyristors are heavily used in megawatt-scale rectifier of ac to dc , in low- and medium-power ( from few tens of watts to few tens of kilowatts ) applications they have virtually been replaced by other devices with superior switching characteristics like power mosfets or igbts thyristor manufacturers generally specify a region of safe firing defining acceptable levels of voltage and current for a given operating temperature '' safe firing of thyristors '' on powerguru.org as well as the usual failure modes due to exceeding voltage , current or power ratings , thyristors have their own particular modes of failure , including : turn on di/dt – in which the rate of rise of on-state current after triggering is higher than can be supported by the spreading speed of the active conduction area ( scrs & triacs ) light-triggered thyristors are available with in-built over-voltage ( vbo ) protection , which triggers the thyristor when the forward voltage across it becomes too high ; they have also been made with in-built forward recovery protection , but not commercially despite the simplification they can bring to the electronics of an hvdc valve , light-triggered thyristors may still require some simple monitoring electronics and are only available from a few manufacturers
