commonly used protein production systems include those derived from bacteria , yeast , baculovirus/insect , mammalian cells , and more recently filamentous fungi such as myceliophthora thermophila when biopharmaceuticals are produced with one of these systems , process-related impurities termed host cell proteins also arrive in the final product in trace amounts the oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell-based and may be defined as the '' combination of an expression vector , its cloned dna , and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell , that is , produce proteins at a high level '' expression systems are normally referred to by the host and the dna source or the delivery mechanism for the genetic material to address these concerns , expressions systems using multiple eukaryotic cells were developed for applications requiring the proteins be conformed as in , or closer to eukaryotic organisms : cells of plants ( i.e mammalian in vivo expression systems have however low yield and other limitations ( time-consuming , toxicity to host cells , to combine the high yield/productivity and scalable protein features of bacteria and yeast , and advanced epigenetic features of plants , insects and mammalians systems , other protein production systems are developed using unicellular eukaryotes ( i.e for example , a dna sequence for a protein of interest could be cloned or subcloned into a high copy-number plasmid containing the lac ( often lacuv5 ) promoter , which is then transformed into the bacterium e cerevisiae or pichia pastoris allow stable and lasting production of proteins that are processed similarly to mammalian cells , at high yield , in chemically defined media of proteins the non-lytic system has been used to give higher protein yield and quicker expression of recombinant genes compared to baculovirus-infected cell expression leishmania tarentolae ( can not infect mammals ) expression systems allow stable and lasting production of proteins at high yield , in chemically defined media these reagents may be produced by extraction from cells or from a cell-based expression system
