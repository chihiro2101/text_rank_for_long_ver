most integrated circuits ( ics ) of sufficient complexity use a clock signal in order to synchronize different parts of the circuit , cycling at a rate slower than the worst-case internal propagation delays a clock signal might also be gated , that is , combined with a controlling signal that enables or disables the clock signal for a certain part of a circuit this technique is often used to save power by effectively shutting down portions of a digital circuit when they are not in use , but comes at a cost of increased complexity in timing analysis the mos technology 6502 uses the same 2-phase logic internally , but also includes a two-phase clock generator on-chip , so it only needs a single phase clock input , simplifying system design some early integrated circuits use four-phase logic , requiring a four phase clock input consisting of four separate , non-overlapping clock signals this allows the cpu to operate at a much higher frequency than the rest of the computer , which affords performance gains in situations where the cpu does not need to wait on an external factor ( like memory or input/output ) the vast majority of digital devices do not require a clock at a fixed , constant frequency such digital devices work just as well with a clock generator that dynamically changes its frequency , such as spread spectrum clock , dynamic frequency scaling , etc alternatively , using a sine wave clock , cmos transmission gates and energy-saving techniques , the power requirements can be reduced in a large microprocessor , the power used to drive the clock signal can be over 30 % of the total power used by the entire chip since this function is vital to the operation of a synchronous system , much attention has been given to the characteristics of these clock signals and the electrical networks used in their distribution since the data signals are provided with a temporal reference by the clock signals , the clock waveforms must be particularly clean and sharp the delay components that make up a general synchronous system are composed of the following three individual subsystems : the memory storage elements , the logic elements , and the clocking circuitry and distribution network
