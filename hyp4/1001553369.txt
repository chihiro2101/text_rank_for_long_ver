the emulation can even extend to having graphics that model the exact placements of the original hardware controls some simulators can even import the original sound patches with accuracy that is nearly indistinguishable from the original synthesizer it is also possible to generate sound files offline , meaning sound generation does not have to be in real time , or live image : cubase 6 feature - software instruments and software effects.svg thumb top : software instruments bottom : software effect processors on cubase 6 a software instrument can be a synthesized version of a real instrument ( like the sounds of a violin or drums ) , or a unique instrument , generated by computer software software instruments have been made popular by the convergence of synthesizers and computers , as well as sequencing software like garageband , logic pro ( geared toward professionals ) , the open source project audacity , and ableton live which is geared towards live performances also of note is software like csound and nyquist , which can be used to program software instruments software synthesizers can have more advanced algorithms than digital hardware synthesizers due to the much greater processing speed ( as well as support for floating point processing and greater than 24-bit word size ) of the x86-64 cpus that modern music production personal computers have over the digital signal processors found in common hardware synthesizers many softsynths use mathematical algorithms that directly emulate the electronic components and circuitry of the original hardware synthesizer there are many other open-source software synthesizers available for free for unix-based operating systems , including amsynth , hexter , tal noizemaker , xsynth , wsynth , whysynth , add64 , obxd , mx44 , phasex , alsa modular synth , bristol and others still the microsoft gs wavetable sw synth ( based on sample-based synthesis ) included in instances of directx as an integral part of directmusic is a version of the roland virtual sound canvas with gs sound set licensed by microsoft from roland corporation in 1996 the integrated processors included in mobile phones have become so fast , that synthesizer applications ( apps ) can play with the same capabilities as the classic analog or digital synths one example is the windows phone synthesizer
