megafauna – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally k-strategists , with high longevity , slow population growth rates , low mortality rates , and ( at least for the largest ) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults these characteristics , although not exclusive to such megafauna , make them vulnerable to human overexploitation , in part because of their slow population recovery rates . evolution of large body size subsequent to the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event that eliminated the non-avian dinosaurs about ma ( million years ) ago , terrestrial mammals underwent a nearly exponential increase in body size as they diversified to occupy the ecological niches left vacant among terrestrial mammals , the fastest rates of increase of body mass 0.259 vs terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several eutherian groups ( the artiodactyl andrewsarchus - formerly considered a mesonychid , the oxyaenid sarkastodon , and the carnivorans amphicyon and arctodus ) all reached a maximum size of about 1000 & nbsp ; kg ( the carnivoran arctotherium and the hyaenodontid simbakubwa may have been somewhat larger ) since tetrapods ( first reptiles , later mammals ) returned to the sea in the late permian , they have dominated the top end of the marine body size range , due to the more efficient intake of oxygen possible using lungs following this , the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt , and then to have backtracked , although the available fossil records are limited however , in the period from 31 ma ago ( in the oligocene ) to the present , cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass ( a rate of increase in body mass 0.259 of a factor of 3.2 per million years ) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals this trend led to the largest animal of all time , the modern blue whale several reasons for the more rapid evolution of large body size in cetaceans are possible among toothed whales , maximum body size appears to be limited by food availability larger size , as in sperm and beaked whales , facilitates deeper diving to access relatively easily-caught , large cephalopod prey in a less competitive environment the largest carnivorans of all time are marine pinnipeds , the largest of which is the southern elephant seal , which can reach 6 meters in length and weigh up to the sirenians are another group of marine mammals which adapted to fully aquatic life around the same time as the cetaceans did because of the small initial size of all mammals following the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs , nonmammalian vertebrates had a roughly ten-million-year-long window of opportunity ( during the paleocene ) for evolution of gigantism without much competition this is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous gastornithid birds evolved in the northern hemisphere , while flightless paleognaths evolved to large size on gondwanan land masses and europe gastornithids and at least one lineage of flightless paleognath birds originated in europe , both lineages dominating niches for large herbivores while mammals remained below 45 & nbsp ; kg ( in contrast with other landmasses like north america and asia , which saw the earlier evolution of larger mammals ) and were the largest european tetrapods in the paleocene however , recent genetic studies have found that tinamous nest well within the ratite tree , and are the sister group of the extinct moa of new zealand in south america , the related phorusrhacids shared the dominant predatory niches with metatherian sparassodonts during most of the cenozoic but declined and ultimately went extinct after eutherian predators arrived from north america ( as part of the great american interchange ) during the pliocene however , none of the flightless birds of the cenozoic , including the predatory brontornis , possibly omnivorous dromornis or herbivorous vorombe , ever grew to masses much above 500 & nbsp ; kg , and thus never attained the size of the largest mammalian carnivores , let alone that of the largest mammalian herbivores nearly all of the world 's isolated islands could furnish similar examples of extinctions occurring shortly after the arrival of humans , though most of these islands , such as the hawaiian islands , never had terrestrial megafauna , so their extinct fauna were smaller in at least some areas , interstadials were periods of expanding human populations an analysis of sporormiella fungal spores ( which derive mainly from the dung of megaherbivores ) in swamp sediment cores spanning the last 130,000 years from lynch 's crater in queensland , australia , showed that the megafauna of that region virtually disappeared about 41,000 years ago , at a time when climate changes were minimal ; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal , and was followed by a transition from rainforest to fire-tolerant sclerophyll vegetation similar conclusions regarding the culpability of human hunters in the disappearance of pleistocene megafauna were derived from high-resolution chronologies obtained via an analysis of a large collection of eggshell fragments of the flightless australian bird genyornis newtoni , from analysis of sporormiella fungal spores from a lake in eastern north america and from study of deposits of shasta ground sloth dung left in over half a dozen caves in the american southwest , many species of other types , including plants , marine invertebrates and plankton , went extinct as well the following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna ( in the sense of the '' large animal '' definition ) however , its extinct relative , the procoptodon procoptodon goliah reached , while extinct diprotodonts attained the largest size of any marsupial in history , up to an estimated trogontherii ) is estimated to have commonly weighed around 10 tonnes , making it possibly the largest proboscid , which would make it the second largest land mammal after indricotherines steller 's sea cow ( hydrodamalis gigas ) was probably around five times as massive , but was exterminated by humans within 27 years of its discovery off the remote commander islands in 1741 the extinct malagasy sloth lemur archaeoindris reached a similar size , while the extinct gigantopithecus blacki of southeast asia is believed to have been larger yet , although probably less than twice as large , contrary to early estimates ( the absence of postcranial remains makes its size difficult to judge ) several recently extinct north american forms were larger : the capybara neochoerus pinckneyi ( another neotropic migrant ) was about 40 % heavier on average ; the castoroides ( castoroides ohioensis ) was similar the extinct blunt-toothed giant hutia ( amblyrhiza inundata ) of several caribbean islands may have been larger still larger extinct cats include the american lion ( p arctotherium augustans , an extinct short-faced bear from south america , was the largest predatory land mammal ever with an estimated average weight of they inhabit tropical forests of southeast asia and south and central america , and include the largest surviving land animals of the latter two regions their extinct central asian relatives the indricotherines were the largest terrestrial mammals of all time bovinae include the largest surviving land animals of europe and north america the sperm whale ( physeter macrocephalus ) is the largest toothed whale and one of the largest predators in vertebrate history , as well as the planet 's loudest and brainiest animal ( with a brain about five times as massive as a human 's ) order pelycosauria ( traditional ; paraphyletic ) cotylorhynchus was a large , big-clawed , herbivorous caseid of early permian north america , reaching and 2 tonnes the largest living bird , the ostrich ( struthio camelus ) was surpassed by the extinct vorombe of madagascar , the heaviest of the group at up to , and the extinct dinornis ( dinornis ) of new zealand , the tallest , growing to heights of ( due to its small size for a continent and its isolation , australia is sometimes viewed as the world 's largest island ; thus , these species could also be considered insular giants ) order cathartiformes the extinct condor-like teratorn argentavis of south america had an estimated wing span of and a mass of approximately , making it the best example of a megafaunal flying bird order pterosauria the largest azhdarchid pterosaurs , such as hatzegopteryx and quetzalcoatlus , attained wingspans around and weights probably in the range similarly large crocodilians , such as mourasuchus and purussaurus , were present as recently as the miocene in south america order squamata while the largest extant lizard , the komodo dragon ( varanus komodoensis ) , another island giant , can reach in length , its extinct australian relative megalania may have reached more than twice that size class amphibia ( in the wide , probably paraphyletic , sense ) order temnospondyli ( relationship to lissamphibia is unclear ) the permian temnospondyl prionosuchus , the largest amphibian known , reached 9 m in length and was an aquatic predator resembling a crocodilian after the appearance of real crocodilians , temnospondyls such as koolasuchus ( 5 m long ) had retreated to the antarctic region by the cretaceous , before going extinct its extinct relative megalodon ( the disputed genus being either carcharodon or carcharocles ) was more than an order of magnitude larger , and is the largest predatory shark or fish of all time ( and one of the largest predators in vertebrate history ) ; it preyed on whales and other marine mammals the latter is the world 's largest invertebrate , and has the largest eyes of any animal by the early ordovician they had evolved into giant ( for the time ) filter feeders , apparently in response to the proliferation of plankton during the great ordovician biodiversification event they survived over 200 million years , but finally died out in the permian–triassic extinction event along with trilobites and most other forms of life present at the time , including most of the dominant terrestrial therapsids the early devonian jaekelopterus reached an estimated length of , not including its raptorial chelicerae , and is thought to have been a freshwater species file : indricotherium11.jpg asian indricothere rhino paraceratherium was among the largest land mammals , about twice a bush elephant 's mass
