the usual epithet of '' al-fayyumi '' refers to saadia 's native place , the fayyum in upper egypt ; in hebrew it is often given as '' pitomi , '' derived from a contemporary identification of fayum with the biblical pithom ( an identification found in saadia 's own works ) at a young age of 20 saadia began composing his first great work , the hebrew dictionary which he entitled agron abraham firkovich , hebrew newspaper hamelitz - 1868 , issue 26–27 at 23 he composed a polemic against the followers of anan ben david , particularly solomon ben yeruham , thus beginning the activity which was to prove important in opposition to karaism , in defense of rabbinic judaism in 922 , six years before saadia was appointed gaon of babylonia , a controversy arose concerning the hebrew calendar , that threatened the entire jewish community saadia 's judeo-arabic translation of the pentateuch ( tafsir ) was copied by them in nearly all their handwritten codices , and they originally studied saadia 's major work of philosophy , beliefs and opinions , in its original judeo-arabic , although by the early 20th-century , only fragments had survived 125 ( note 7 ) ( hebrew ) the question often asked by scholars now is whether saadia applied this principle in his other translations '' even where a certain explanation is given in the babylonian talmud , such as the hebrew words in exo 30:34 ( explained in taanit 7a as meaning '' each spice pounded separately '' ) , saadia sometimes deviates from the rabbinic tradition in his judeo-arabic translation of the pentateuch , in this case explaining its sense as '' having them made of equal portions he wrote both in hebrew and in arabic a work , now known only from a few fragments , entitled '' sefer ha-galui '' ( arabic title , '' kitab al-ṭarid '' ) , in which he emphasized with great but justifiable pride the services which he had rendered , especially in his opposition to heresy tehillim ( judeo-arabic translation and commentary , which he called kitāb al-tasbiḥ '' the book of praise '' ) hebrew translation along with original judeo-arabic by rabbi yosef qafih ( first 40 pages viewable for free ) iyyov ( book of job ) hebrew translation along with the original judeo-arabic by rabbi yosef qafih ( first 40 pages viewable for free ) and mishlei hebrew translation along with the original judeo-arabic by rabbi yosef qafih ( first 40 pages viewable for free ) daniel hebrew translation along with the original judeo-arabic by rabbi yosef qafih ( first 40 pages viewable for free ) '' tafsir al-sab'ina lafẓah , '' a list of seventy ( properly ninety ) hebrew ( and aramaic ) words which occur in the hebrew bible only once or very rarely , and which may be explained from traditional literature , especially from the neo-hebraisms of the mishnah an arabic methodology of the talmud is also mentioned , by azulai , as a work of saadia under the title '' kelale ha-talmud '' with few exceptions these exist only in hebrew , some of them having been probably written in that language of this synagogal poetry the most noteworthy portions are the '' azharot '' on the 613 commandments , which give the author 's name as '' sa'id b emunoth ve-deoth ( kitāb al-amānāt wa-al-iʿatiqādāt ) , the book of beliefs and opinions : this ( כתאב אלאמאנאת ואלאעתקאדאת judeo-arabic ) was the name of saadia 's first edition , later emended by saadia to אלמכ'תאר פי אלאמאנאת ואלאעתקאדאת ( hebrew : הנבחר באמונות ובדעות ) as described by kafih on pages 8-9 of his edition ( this work , first compiled in 933 ce , of which several revisions were made until its final redaction , is considered to be the first systematic attempt to synthesize the jewish tradition with philosophical teachings ayelet cohen , linguistic comments in saadia 's biblical commentary ( abstract ) , haifa university 2017 tafsīr kitāb al-mabādī , saadia gaon 's version of the text itself along with his judeo-arabic commentary with facing hebrew translation by rabbi yosef qafih ( first 40 pages viewable for free ) an arabic translation of and commentary on the sefer yetzirah , written while its author was still residing in egypt ( or israel ) , and intended to explain in a scientific manner how the universe came into existence it was still cited in the twelfth century ;

his importance is due primarily to his establishment of a new school of biblical exegesis characterized by a rational investigation of the contents of the bible and a scientific knowledge of the language of the holy text saadia 's arabic translation of the torah is of importance for the history of civilization ; itself a product of the arabization of a large portion of judaism , it served for centuries as a potent factor in the impregnation of the jewish spirit with arabic culture , so that , in this respect , it may take its place beside the greek bible-translation of antiquity and the german translation of the pentateuch by moses mendelssohn his system of hermeneutics was not limited to the exegesis of individual passages , but treated also each book of the bible as a whole , and showed the connection of its various portions with one another the position assigned to saadia in the oldest list of hebrew grammarians , which is contained in the introduction to abraham ibn ezra 's '' moznayim , '' has not been challenged even by the latest historical investigations his dictionary , primitive and merely practical as it was , became the foundation of hebrew lexicography ; and the name '' agron '' ( literally , '' collection '' ) , which he chose and doubtless created , was long used as a designation for hebrew lexicons , especially by the karaites the very categories of rhetoric , as they were found among the arabs , were first applied by saadia to the style of the bible he was likewise one of the founders of comparative philology , not only through his brief '' book of seventy words , '' already mentioned , but especially through his explanation of the hebrew vocabulary by the arabic , particularly in the case of the favorite translation of biblical words by arabic terms having the same sound saadia 's works were the inspiration and basis for later jewish writers , such as berachyah in his encyclopedic philosophical work sefer hahibbur ( the book of compilation ) yosef qafih published works ( hebrew translations of a number of saadia gaon 's works ) jewish philosophy joseph ( sa'id al-fayyumi ) , jewishencyclopedia.com ;
