in the wars which followed alexander 's death in 323 bc , the region was largely left to its own devices , but it was incorporated in the seleucid empire by seleucus i between 308 and 305 bc , along with the rest of the territories that alexander had conquered in iran and central asia antiochus founded or refounded a number of cities on the greek model in the region and he opened a number of mints to produce coinage on the attic weight standard he probably became seleucid satrap ( governor ) of bactria during antiochus ii 's period in charge of the east , thus about a generation after the original establishment of seleucid control over the region the literary evidence is as follows : justin says that the rebellion occurred 'around the same time ' as the parni conquest of parthia from the seleucid realm , but his dating of this event is confusedâ€”he places it in 256 bc , but during the reign of seleucus ii ( 246-225 bc ) appian syriaca 65 the adulis inscription set up by ptolemy iii to celebrate this event claims that bactria was among ptolemy 's conquests , which is hyperbole but might indicate that bactria had been part of the seleucid empire up to this point different scholars have argued for a 'high chronology ' which places diodotus ' independence around 255 bc in the reign of antiochus ii , or a 'low chronology ' which dates the secession around 245 bc at the beginning of the reign of seleucus ii in his opinion , the process probably began in the 250s bc and was completed in the reign of seleucus ii the choice of zeus may have been intended as a reference to diodotus himself whose name meant 'gift of zeus ' in greek alternatively , it may look back to early coinage struck by seleucus i , from which the reverse image is taken the legend on the reverse of these coins still reads ( 'of king antiochus ' ) a few tetradrachm coins depicting diodotus i in a more 'idealising ' guise were issued late in diodotus ii 's reign ( 'series b ' ) diodotus appears also on coins struck in his memory by the later graeco-bactrian kings agathocles and antimachus he placed her birth around 266 bc and called her 'apama '
