whether or not the irish free state would have a written constitution was the subject of some debate when the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) bill was introduced to the provisional parliament by president cosgrave the labour leader , thomas johnson , remarked : another reason put forward not to adopt a written constitution was that constitutional conventions between members of the british commonwealth were evolving and there was likely to be an imperial conference on the matter before long it was therefore the prevalent view that when , in 1921 , the british government agreed to the creation of a largely independent irish state , that a new constitution was needed on 31 march 1922 , an act of the united kingdom parliament called the irish free state ( agreement ) act 1922 was passed the act gave no power to the provisional parliament to enact a constitution for the irish free state article 83 of the constitution provided that '' the passing and adoption of this constitution by the constituent assembly and the british parliament shall be announced as soon as may be , and not later than the sixth day of december , nineteen hundred and twenty-two , by proclamation of his majesty , and this constitution shall come into operation on the issue of such proclamation '' the british parliament then passed the irish free state constitution act 1922 , which came into force on 5 december 1922 this act recited that the house of parliament constituted pursuant to the irish free state ( agreement ) act , 1922 , sitting as a constituent assembly for the settlement of the constitution of the irish free state , had passed the measure set forth in the schedule to the act , ( namely the constitution adopted by dáil éireann ) , which it then referred to as '' the constituent act '' it then provided that the constituent act should be the constitution of the irish free state and should come into operation on the same being proclaimed by his majesty in accordance with article 83 of the constitution referring to the constitution as a '' measure '' whereby the constitution appearing as the first schedule to the constituent act was declared to be the constitution of the irish free state , the royal proclamation went on to '' announce and proclaim that the constitution of the irish free state as the same was passed and adopted by the said constituent assembly has been passed and adopted by parliament '' the 6 december 1922 was the latest possible date allowed for by the anglo-irish treaty for the continued authority of the provisional government set up by the treaty pending '' the constitution of a parliament and government of the irish free state '' under british constitutional legal theory , the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) act 1922 held the force of law because of the enactment of the united kingdom 's irish free state constitution act 1922 ; primary : act as originally passed text incorporating all amendments and noting many implementation acts ; secondary : murray , thomas ( 2016 ) contesting economic and social rights in ireland : constitution , state and society , 1848–2016 cambridge university press
