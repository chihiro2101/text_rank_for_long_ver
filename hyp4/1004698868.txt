a second measurement using another station was then taken commercial am radio stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power , but strings of low-power radio beacons were also set up specifically for this task , especially near airports and harbours the main problem with rdf is that it required a special antenna on the vehicle , which may not be easy to mount on smaller vehicles or single-crew aircraft a smaller problem is that the accuracy of the system is based to a degree on the size of the antenna , but larger antennas would likewise make the installation more difficult as the antenna rotated through a fixed position , typically due north , the antenna was keyed with the morse code signal of the station 's identification letters so the receiver could ensure they were listening to the right station once the aircraft 's approach is accurate ( the aircraft is in the '' right place '' ) , the vor receiver will be used on a different frequency to determine if the aircraft is pointed in the '' right direction '' military aircraft will usually employ two vor receiver systems , one in vor-only mode to determine '' right place '' and another in ils mode in conjunction with a glideslope receiver to determine '' right direction a number of stations are used to create an airway , with the navigator tuning in different stations along the direction of travel these systems were common in the era when electronics were large and expensive , as they placed minimum requirements on the receivers – they were simply voice radio sets tuned to the selected frequencies however , they did not provide navigation outside of the beams , and were thus less flexible in use originally known as '' ultrakurzwellen-landefunkfeuer '' ( lff ) , or simply '' leitstrahl '' ( guiding beam ) , little money was available to develop a network of stations the first widespread radio navigation network , using low and medium frequencies , was instead led by the us ( see lff , below ) although there was some interest in deploying a medium-range system like the us lff , deployment had not yet started when the beam system was combined with the orfordness timing concepts to produce the highly accurate sonne system this used very large antennas to provide the required accuracy at long distances ( over england ) , and very powerful transmitters the low-frequency radio range ( lfr , also '' four course radio range '' among other names ) was the main navigation system used by aircraft for instrument flying in the 1930s and 1940s in the u.s the introduction of radar in the 1930s provided a way to directly determine the distance to an object even at long distances transponders are a combination of receiver and transmitter whose operation is automated – upon reception of a particular signal , normally a pulse on a particular frequency , the transponder sends out a pulse in response , typically delayed by some very short time transponders were initially used as the basis for early iff systems ; aircraft with the proper transponder would appear on the display as part of the normal radar operation , but then the signal from the transponder would cause a second blip to appear a short time later in comparison , transponder-based systems measure the timing between two signals , and the accuracy of that measure is largely a function of the equipment and nothing else this allows these systems to remain accurate over very long range the latest transponder systems ( mode s ) can also provide position information , possibly derived from gnss , allowing for even more precise positioning of targets to ease pilot workload only one of these was used for navigation – prior to the mission a circle was drawn over the target from one of the stations , and the aircraft was directed to fly along this circle on instructions from the ground operator this basic concept has formed the basis of most distance measuring navigation systems to this day the asv radar introduced by raf coastal command was designed to track down submarines and ships by displaying the signal from two antennas side by side and allowing the operator to compare their relative strength adding a ground-based transponder immediately turned the same display into a system able to guide the aircraft towards a transponder , or '' beacon '' in this role , with high accuracy beacons were widely used for temporary or mobile navigation as well , as the transponder systems were generally small and low-powered , able to be man portable or mounted on a jeep dme was identical to gee-h in concept , but used new electronics to automatically measure the time delay and display it as a number , rather than having the operator time the signals manually on an oscilloscope this combination allows a single vor/dme station to provide both angle and distance , and thereby provide a single-station fix as these systems are almost always used with a specific navigational chart with the hyperbolic lines plotted on it , they generally reveal the receiver 's location directly , eliminating the need for manual triangulation if the signal from two stations arrived at the same time , the aircraft must be an equal distance from both transmitters , allowing the navigator to determine a line of position on his chart of all the positions at that distance from both stations by making similar measurements with other stations , additional lines of position can be produced , leading to a fix however , this was far easier to display ; the system could output the phase angle to a pointer on a dial removing any need for visual interpretation as the circuitry for driving this display was quite small , decca systems normally used three such displays , allowing quick and accurate reading of multiple fixes loran-c was fairly complex to use , requiring a room of equipment to pull out the different signals however , like the beam systems before it , civilian use of loran-c was short-lived when gps technology drove it from the market these systems determined pulse timing not by comparison of two signals , but by comparison of a single signal with a local atomic clock by measuring signal times of arrival ( toas ) from at least four satellites , the user 's receiver can re-build an accurate clock signal of its own and allows hyperbolic navigation to be carried out satellite navigation systems offer better accuracy than any land-based system , are available at almost all locations on the earth , can be implemented ( receiver-side ) a modest cost and complexity , with modern electronics , and require only a few dozen satellites to provide worldwide coverage as a result of these advantages , satellite navigation has led to almost all previous systems falling from use the only other systems still in use are aviation aids , which are also being turned off for long-range navigation while new differential gps systems are being deployed to provide the local accuracy needed for blind landings
