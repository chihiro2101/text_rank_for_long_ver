in the treaty , russia limited its claims to lands north of parallel 54°40′ north , and also agreed to open russian ports to u.s the california gold rush showed that if gold were discovered in alaska , americans and british canadians would overwhelm the russian presence in what one scholar later described as '' siberia 's siberia '' however , the principal reason for the sale is that the hard-to-defend colony would be easily conquered by british forces based out of neighboring canada in any future conflict , and russia did not wish to see its main arch-rival being next door just across the bering sea the russian government discussed the proposal in 1857 and 1858 , and offered to sell the territory to the united states , hoping that its presence in the region would offset the plans of britain however , no deal was reached , as the risk of an american civil war was a more pressing concern in washington over the winter of 1859–1860 de stoeckl held meetings with american officials , though he had been instructed not to initiate discussions about the sale of the rac assets . russia continued to see an opportunity to weaken british power by causing british columbia , including the royal navy base at esquimalt , to be surrounded or annexed by american territory president andrew johnson was busy with negotiations about reconstruction and seward had alienated a number of republicans , so both men believed that the purchase would help divert attention from the domestic issues this name had earlier , in the russian era , denoted the alaska peninsula , which the russians had called '' аляска '' ( alyaska ) ( also alyaksa is attested , especially in older sources ) seward and many other americans believed that asia would become an important market for the country 's products , and expected that alaska would serve as a base for american trade with asia and globally and for american power in the pacific while agreeing with seward about the benefit to trade , senator charles sumner was unusual in expecting that the territory would be valuable on its own ; having studied the records of explorers , he believed that it contained valuable animals and forests seward told the nation that the russians estimated that alaska contained about 2,500 russians and those of mixed race ( that is , a russian father and native mother ) , and 8,000 indigenous people , in all about 10,000 people under the direct government of the russian fur company , and possibly 50,000 inuit and alaska natives living outside its jurisdiction a review of dozens of contemporary newspapers found general support for the purchase , especially in california ; most of 48 major newspapers supported the purchase would probably derive great economic benefits from the purchase ; friendship with russia was important ; and it would facilitate the acquisition of british columbia forty-five percent of supportive newspapers cited the increased potential for annexing british columbia in their support , and the new york times stated that , consistent with seward 's reason , alaska would increase american trade with east asia some opposed the united states obtaining its first non-contiguous territory , seeing it as a colony ; others saw no need to pay for land that they expected the country to obtain through manifest destiny davis established his residence in the governor 's house , and most of the russian citizens went home , leaving a few traders and priests who chose to remain after the transfer , a number of russian citizens remained in sitka , but nearly all of them very soon decided to return to russia , which was still possible at the expense of the russian-american company moreover , ahllund 's article is the only known description of the return voyage on the winged arrow , a ship that was especially purchased to transport the russians back to their native country american settlers who shared sumner 's belief in the riches of alaska rushed to the territory but found that much capital was required to exploit its resources , many of which were also found closer to markets in the contiguous united states the united states acquired an area over twice as large as texas , but it was not until the great klondike gold rush in 1896 that alaska generally came to be seen as a valuable addition to american territory the business grew so large that the earnings of english laborers after the acquisition of alaska by the united states amounted by 1890 to 12,000,000 however , exclusive us control of this resource was eventually challenged , and the bering sea controversy resulted when the united states seized over 150 sealing ships flying the british flag , based out of the coast of british columbia barker has argued that the us federal government has not earned a positive financial return on the purchase of alaska other economists and scholars , including scott goldsmith and terrence cole , have criticized the metrics used to reach those conclusions by noting that most contiguous western states would fail to meet the bar of '' positive financial return '' using the same criteria and by contending that looking at the increase in net national income , instead of only us treasury revenue , would paint a much more accurate picture of the financial return of alaska as an investment alaska day celebrates the formal transfer of alaska from russia to the united states , which took place on october 18 , 1867 however , some days later , prince hans-adam ii wrote a letter to lichtenstein 's two major newspapers ( liechtensteiner vaterland and liechtensteiner volksblatt ) in which he assured that the alleged purchase offer was not a rumor and that it had been repeatedly discussed within the princely family treaty with russia for the purchase of alaska and related resources at the library of congress meeting of frontiers , library of congress program featuring the purchase check cashed for gold at riggs bank ( 17:00 minute mark )
