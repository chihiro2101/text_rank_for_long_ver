the motivational definition given by shing-tung yau is of a compact kähler manifold with a vanishing first chern class , that is also ricci flat a calabi & ndash ; yau n-fold or calabi & ndash ; yau manifold of ( complex ) dimension n is sometimes defined as a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions : the canonical bundle of m is trivial the simplest examples where this happens are hyperelliptic surfaces , finite quotients of a complex torus of complex dimension 2 , which have vanishing first integral chern class but non-trivial canonical bundle for a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m the following conditions are equivalent to each other , but are weaker than the conditions above , though they are sometimes used as the definition of a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold : m has vanishing first real chern class m has a finite cover that is a product of a torus and a simply connected manifold with trivial canonical bundle if a compact kähler manifold is simply connected , then the weak definition above is equivalent to the stronger definition enriques surfaces give examples of complex manifolds that have ricci-flat metrics , but their canonical bundles are not trivial , so they are calabi–yau manifolds according to the second but not the first definition above on the other hand , their double covers are calabi–yau manifolds for both definitions ( in fact , k3 surfaces ) some definitions require that the holonomy be exactly equal to su ( n ) rather than a subgroup of it , which implies that the hodge numbers h^^4 equipped with a complex manifold structure enriques surfaces and hyperelliptic surfaces have first chern class that vanishes as an element of the real cohomology group , but not as an element of the integral cohomology group , so yau 's theorem about the existence of a ricci-flat metric still applies to them but they are sometimes not considered to be calabi & ndash ; yau manifolds in turn , it has also been conjectured by miles reid that the number of topological types of calabi–yau 3-folds is infinite , and that they can all be transformed continuously ( through certain mild singularizations such as conifolds ) one into another & mdash ; much as riemann surfaces can one of these is related to the original quintic by mirror symmetry essentially , calabi & ndash ; yau manifolds are shapes that satisfy the requirement of space for the six '' unseen '' spatial dimensions of string theory , which may be smaller than our currently observable lengths as they have not yet been detected more precisely , in the absence of fluxes , compactification on a calabi & ndash ; yau 3-fold ( real dimension 6 ) leaves one quarter of the original supersymmetry unbroken if the holonomy is the full su ( 3 )
