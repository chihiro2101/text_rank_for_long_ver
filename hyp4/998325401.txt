it was eventually used as a space launch vehicle the unusual appearance of the first stage results from the need to transport components by rail the first stage of the proton rocket at russian space web a rushed development program led to dozens of failures between 1965 and 1972 in june 2018 , the state corporation roscosmos announced that the proton rocket would cease production as the new angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational the initial proton tests in 1965â€“66 only used the first two stages of the booster , the complete four-stage vehicle being flown for the first time in 1967 the proton m 's improvements included lower stage modifications to reduce structural mass , increase thrust , and fully use propellants proton launch vehicles and briz-m upper stages are designed and built by khrunichev state research and production space center ( khrunichev ) in moscow , the majority owner of international launch services ( ils ) an enhanced variant , the phase iii proton-m/briz-m launch vehicle , was flight proven on the russian federal dual mission of express am-44 and express md-1 in february 2009 and performed its first commercial launch in march 2010 with the echostar xiv satellite on 6 august 2012 , the russian federal space agency lost a russian and an indonesian communications satellite in an attempt to launch them into orbit on a proton-m due to technical difficulties with the last stage on 2 july 2013 , a proton-m launching three glonass navigation satellites experienced a failure reminiscent of the 1960s disasters shortly after liftoff when the booster crashed near lc-39 at baikonour , ending a 30-year unbroken stretch without a first stage failure ; all future proton flights were suspended pending investigation on 16 may 2015 , a mexsat communications satellite failed to orbit due to another third stage malfunction , the eighth proton failure since 2010 khrunichev has initiated development of a set of phase iv enhancements in order to keep pace with market demands and the mass growth trends of commercial satellites significant upgrades were temporarily put on hold following announcement ( in 1992 ) of the new angara launch vehicle however , as kvrb is noticeably larger than block d , the vehicle 's aerodynamics , flight control , software , and possibly electronics would have to be reevaluated in addition , the launch pad can supply existing protons with common hypergolic fuels from single sources they will also be designed from the start to accept a kvtk stage , and will already have a lox supply at the pad ; only a hydrogen supply will be called upon
