early life and education '' david baltimore , 1975 nobel laureate and one of the nation 's best-known scientists , is a good case in point he was introduced to molecular biology by george streisinger under whose mentorship he worked for a summer at cold spring harbor laboratory as part of the inaugural cohort of the undergraduate research program in 1959 there he also met two new mit faculty , future nobel laureate salvador luria and cyrus levinthal who were scouting for candidates for a new program of graduate education in molecular biology he took the cold spring harbor course on animal virology in 1961 and he moved to richard franklin 's lab at the rockefeller institute at new york city which was one of the few labs pioneering molecular research on animal virology this may have influenced president richard nixon 's war on cancer which was launched in 1971 and substantially increased research funding for the disease the conference discussed possible dangers of new biotechnology , drew up voluntary safety guidelines , and issued a call for an ongoing moratorium on certain types of experiments and review of possible experiments , which has been institutionalized by recombinant dna advisory committees established at essentially all us academic institutions conducting molecular biology research baltimore was well aware of the importance of the changes occurring in the laboratory : '' the whole asilomar process opened up to the world that modern biology had new powers that you had never conceived of before in 1973 , he was awarded a prestigious american cancer society professor of microbiology that provided substantial salary support also in 1973 , he became one of the early faculty members in the newly organized mit center for cancer ( ccr ) , capping a creative and industrious period of his career with nearly fifty research publications including the paradigm-shifting paper on reverse transcriptase after winning the nobel prize , baltimore reorganized his laboratory , refocusing on immunology and virology , with immunoglobulin gene expression as a major area of interest this type of enzymatic activity was also discovered by tony hunter , who has done extensive work in the area '' jack '' whitehead , baltimore was asked to help establish a self-governed research institute dedicated to basic biomedical research they devised a unique structure of an independent research institute composed of '' members '' with a close relationship with the department of biology of mit whitehead institute 's contributions to bioscience have long been second to none less than a decade after its founding with continued leadership by baltimore , the whitehead institute was named the top research institution in the world in molecular biology and genetics , and over a recent 10-year period , papers published by whitehead scientists were the most cited papers of any biological research institute baltimore served as director of the wibr and expanded the faculty and research areas into key areas of research including mouse and drosophila genetics during this time , baltimore 's own research program thrived in the new institute important breakthroughs from baltimore 's lab include the discovery of the key transcription factor nf-Îºb by dr their discovery led to an '' information explosion '' involving '' one of the most intensely studied signaling paradigms of the last two decades he moved his research group to new york in stages and continued to make creative contributions to virology and cellular regulation a3 hotz , robert lee ( may 14 , 1997 ) '' prominent biology nobelist chosen to head caltech ; controversial and outspoken scientist david baltimore says his appointment reflects school 's desire for bigger role in nation 's scientific debates during baltimore 's tenure at caltech , united states president bill clinton awarded baltimore the national medal of science in 1999 for his numerous contributions to the scientific world in recent research led by jimmy zhao , baltimore 's team has discovered a small rna molecule called microrna-146a ( mir-146a ) and bred a strain of mice that lacks mir146a baltimore recently joined with other scientists to call for a worldwide moratorium on use of a new genome-editing technique to alter inheritable human dna in addition to his influence on public policy for recombinant dna research , baltimore has influenced national policy concerning the aids epidemic wolff were invited by the national academy of sciences and the institute of medicine to coauthor an independent report : confronting aids ( 1986 ) , in which they called for a 1 billion research program for hiv/aids baltimore also serves on the jackson laboratory 's board of trustees , the bulletin of the atomic scientists ' board of sponsors , amgen , inc during the late 1980s and early 1990s , thereza imanishi-kari , a scientist who was not in baltimore 's laboratory but in a separate , independent laboratory at mit , was implicated in a case of scientific fraud the case was linked to baltimore 's name because of his scientific collaboration with and later his strong defense of imanishi-kari against accusations of fraud o'toole soon dropped her challenge , but the nih , which had funded the contested paper 's research , began investigating , at the insistence of walter w '' fraud in nih grant programs , '' april 12 , 1988 ;

hhs ) found imanishi-kari guilty on 19 counts of research misconduct , basing its conclusions largely on secret service analysis of laboratory notebooks baltimore has also written his own analysis in october 2005 , baltimore resigned the office of the president of caltech , saying , '' this is not a decision that i have made easily , but i am convinced that the interests of the institute will be best served by a presidential transition at this particular time in its history baltimore ( 1986 ) molecular cell biology , scientific american , new york , new york caltech biology division faculty member page baltimore laboratory at caltech site david baltimore 's seminars : '' danger from the wild : hiv , can we conquer it ?
