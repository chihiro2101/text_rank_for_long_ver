the initial launch was boosted by four strap-on liquid rocket boosters making up the first stage , with a central 'sustainer ' engine powering through both the first and the second stage for the first time the development of the project was created a separate volume dedicated to the testing of missile technology the launch system simulated flight conditions with strap-on boosters pushing the central core forward the r-7 rocket was another soviet attempt to build a successful rocket to get to space the next icbm test took place on 30 january 1958 , but the strap-ons failed to separate cleanly and damaged plumbing in the core stage , which lost thrust and impacted far off target the additional development resulted in the 8k74 ( also known as r-7a ) , which was lighter , had better navigation systems , more powerful engines , extended its range to by carrying more fuel , and increased payload to aside from the initial sputnik launches , the 8k71 formed the basis of the 8k72 booster used for the first generation luna probes total service was limited to no more than ten nuclear-armed missiles active at any time with the u-2 overflights , the huge r-7 launch complexes could not be hidden and therefore could be expected to be destroyed quickly in any nuclear war also , the r-7 took almost twenty hours to prepare for launching , and it could not be left on alert for more than a day due to its cryogenic fuel system additionally , the huge payload for which it was designed , adapted to early heavy h-bombs , became irrelevant with the coming of lighter bomb technology while the r-7 turned out to be impractical as a weapon , it became the basis for a series of soviet expendable launch system , the soyuz ( rocket family ) as of 2018 , in modified versions ( soyuz-u , soyuz-fg , and the soyuz-2 ( including the boosterless soyuz-2.1v ) , the vehicle is still in service , having launched over 1840 times r-7 ( rocket family ) list of missiles timeline of russian innovation
