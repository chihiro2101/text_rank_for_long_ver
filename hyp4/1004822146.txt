thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero this results in the electrodynamic generation of coupled electric and magnetic fields , resulting in the emission of photons , radiating energy away from the body the characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface from which it is emanating , including its temperature , its spectral emissivity , as expressed by kirchhoff 's law thus , to thermal radiation it appears black most of the energy is associated with photons of longer wavelengths ; these do not help a person see , but still transfer heat to the environment , as can be deduced empirically by observing an incandescent light bulb unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer , thermal radiation can be concentrated in a tiny spot by using reflecting mirrors , which concentrating solar power takes advantage of low-emissivity windows in houses are a more complicated technology , since they must have low emissivity at thermal wavelengths while remaining transparent to visible light a selective emitter radiating strongly in this range is thus exposed to the clear sky , enabling the use of the outer space as a very low temperature heat sink however , the human body is a very efficient emitter of infrared radiation , which provides an additional cooling mechanism there are 4 main properties that characterize thermal radiation ( in the limit of the far field ) : thermal radiation emitted by a body at any temperature consists of a wide range of frequencies even at a white-hot temperature of 2000 k , 99 % of the energy of the radiation is still in the infrared the rate of electromagnetic radiation emitted at a given frequency is proportional to the amount of absorption that it would experience by the source , a property known as reciprocity the general properties of thermal radiation as described by the planck 's law apply if the linear dimension of all parts considered , as well as radii of curvature of all surfaces are large compared with the wavelength of the ray considered ' ( typically from 8-25 micrometres for the emitter at 300 k ) indeed , thermal radiation as discussed above takes only radiating waves ( far-field , or electromagnetic radiation ) into account a more sophisticated framework involving electromagnetic theory must be used for smaller distances from the thermal source or surface ( near-field thermal radiation ) for example , although far-field thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent , near-field thermal radiation ( i.e this deviation is especially strong ( up to several orders in magnitude ) when the emitter and absorber support surface polariton modes that can couple through the gap separating cold and hot objects to achieve the required level of photon confinement , the dimensions of the radiating objects should be on the order of or below the thermal wavelength predicted by planck 's law incandescence infrared photography interior radiation control coating heat transfer planck radiation radiant cooling sakumaâ€“hattori equation thermal dose unit view factor
