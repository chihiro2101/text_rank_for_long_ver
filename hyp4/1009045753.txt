much of the responsibility that awaited them in the village was considered , from the traditional point of view , to be women 's work due to the collectivization policy , many herders moved north while many of those that remained were '' deprived of their reindeer '' although the nenets herders were greatly affected , their lifestyle was not at threat for too long the next few decades saw the slow progress of the nenets people regaining and preserving their traditional nomadic lifestyle another method was for young herders to get a job as official workers of the state and pasture their own collective reindeer herd along with the private herd of one of their relatives once these herds were together and migration commenced , officials would not be able to know which of the reindeer were privately owned the nenet people depend heavily on fishing and reindeer herding to support their lifestyle specifically , the nomadic lifestyle the nenet people have been accustomed to for generations is in danger as the oil industries encroach on reindeer pasture and territory the impact of large energy corporations in the yamal peninsula can be felt in numerous ways additionally , the herders believe that it is necessary for the reindeer to migrate in order for them to maintain their good health however , the companies that enter the yamal peninsula also prefer this rugged terrain to build their infrastructure upon , causing a direct overlap in land of interest for example , in the bovanenko core area , a research study was conducted that found that industrial development targeted '' rugged , elevated drier land '' which is the type of land used by the reindeer herders thus , as the nenets people rely on reindeer that , in turn , rely on the migratory routes , the expansion of industrial development has had a large impact on the nenets people although not directly related to migration routes , another impact is the effect on nenets peoples ' sacred spots the nenets people have a tradition of designating a scared spot where they make a request of the spirits for a successful migration in one case , a sacred spot of the nenets people was fenced in during the industrial development , dissolving it of its traditional significance many of the workers believed that their construction did not actually intrude on the sacred spot , however many of the herders believed that the spot had been '' desecrated '' additionally , the industrial development has spilled over to occupy much of the fishing grounds necessary for the nenets people this is because there is concern that authorities of the nenets people will make a deal to merge with another region nenets people worry that the deal will lead to a passing in their autonomy as well as their language and traditions in a similar vain , nenets people also face danger from industrial companies although the industrial companies have paid compensations and made efforts to assist the nenets people , some experts say that the current process does not allow for participation from the nenets people this sort of relationship is described by some as '' paternalistic '' as it does not aid in allowing the nenets people to make their own decisions however , it is difficult for the nomadic people to gather as a collective unit as they live so far apart from each other the voice of the tundra focuses its attention on three main issues : a shortage of land for the reindeer due to oil and gas companies expanding use of the territories , the uncertainty surrounding the future of nomadic reindeer herding , and the lack of indigenous leadership and organization this petition brought attention to the russian officials who were not addressing the '' real life of the tundra and indigenous people '' although there are many nenets people who are against the industrial development going on in the yamal peninsula such as the activists aforementioned , there are also many who are in support of the developments this reasoning can be seen as falling similarly in line with what the voice of the tundra was fighting for , as it can be seen that proper indigenous leadership and involvement can lead to higher satisfaction among the nenets people
