weyl returned to this topic several times , considered elasticity system and formulated the weyl conjecture in 1913 , weyl published die idee der riemannschen fl√§che ( the concept of a riemann surface ) , which gave a unified treatment of riemann surfaces in it weyl utilized point set topology , in order to make riemann surface theory more rigorous , a model followed in later work on manifolds brouwer 's early work in topology for this purpose in 1918 , he introduced the notion of gauge , and gave the first example of what is now known as a gauge theory husserl had reacted strongly to gottlob frege 's criticism of his first work on the philosophy of arithmetic and was investigating the sense of mathematical and other structures , which frege had distinguished from empirical reference from 1923 to 1938 , weyl developed the theory of compact groups , in terms of representation theorys these results are foundational in understanding the symmetry structure of quantum mechanics , which he put on a group-theoretic basis together with the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics , in large measure due to john von neumann , this gave the treatment familiar since about 1930 non-compact groups and their representations , particularly the heisenberg group , were also streamlined in that specific context , in his 1927 weyl quantization , the best extant bridge between classical and quantum physics to date from this time , and certainly much helped by weyl 's expositions , lie groups and lie algebras became a mainstream part both of pure mathematics and theoretical physics his book the classical groups reconsidered invariant theory harmonic analysis and analytic number theory weyl also showed how to use exponential sums in diophantine approximation , with his criterion for equidistributed mod 1 , which was a fundamental step in analytic number theory this work applied to the riemann zeta function , as well as additive number theory in the continuum weyl developed the logic of impredicativity using the lower levels of bertrand russell 's ramified theory of types he was able to develop most of classical calculus , while using neither the axiom of choice nor proof by contradiction , and avoiding georg cantor 's infinite sets the '' crisis '' article had disturbed weyl 's formalist teacher hilbert , but later in the 1920s weyl partially reconciled his position with that of hilbert after about 1928 weyl had apparently decided that mathematical intuitionism was not compatible with his enthusiasm for the phenomenological philosophy of husserl , as he had apparently earlier thought in the last decades of his life weyl emphasized mathematics as '' symbolic construction '' and moved to a position closer not only to hilbert but to that of ernst cassirer 392 in these days the angel of topology and the devil of abstract algebra fight for the soul of each individual mathematical domain robertson , the theory of groups and quantum mechanics , 1931 , rept
