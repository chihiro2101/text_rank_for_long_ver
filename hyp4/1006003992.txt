these waves travel at the speed of sound and , as the speed of the object increases , the waves are forced together , or compressed , because they can not get out of each other 's way quickly enough eventually they merge into a single shock wave , which travels at the speed of sound , a critical speed known as mach 1 , and is approximately at sea level and because the different radial directions around the aircraft 's direction of travel are equivalent ( given the '' smooth flight '' condition ) , the shock wave forms a mach cone , similar to a vapour cone , with the aircraft at its tip in the late 1950s when supersonic transport ( sst ) designs were being actively pursued , it was thought that although the boom would be very large , the problems could be avoided by flying higher this eventually doomed most sst projects as public resentment , mixed with politics , eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft less useful ( flying supersonically only over water for instance ) seebass and george also worked on the problem from a different angle , trying to spread out the n-wave laterally and temporally ( longitudinally ) , by producing a strong and downwards-focused ( sr-71 blackbird , boeing x-43 ) shock at a sharp , but wide angle nose cone , which will travel at slightly supersonic speed ( bow shock ) , and using a swept back flying wing or an oblique wing to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight ( the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed ) to adapt this principle to existing planes , which generate a shock at their nose cone and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge , the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the area rule after measuring the 1,300 recordings , some taken inside the shock wave by a chase plane , the ssbd demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third although one-third is not a huge reduction , it could have reduced concorde 's boom to an acceptable level below fm 1 are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the low boom flight demonstrator ( lbfd ) , which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing the sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom a sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double '' boom '' as the aircraft is usually some distance away it is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition ; rather , the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight all we see is the pressure wave moving down the aeroplane â€“ it gives an indication on the instruments even strong n-waves such as those generated by concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the over-pressure is sufficiently long boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path , progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track therefore , for a boom to reach the ground , the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground for example , the speed of sound at is about , but an aircraft must travel at least ( mach 1.12 , where mach 1 equals the speed of sound ) for a boom to be heard on the ground
