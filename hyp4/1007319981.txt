although there has been some disagreement as to the temporal sequence of events , it is generally agreed that the narrative should be viewed in chronological order , beginning in room 1 ( scene of tribute , dressing , dance , mummery and musical performance ) ; then on to room 2 ( scene of violent conflict , and a display in which a human cull is presented , tortured and killed in the company of the highest members of court and upper echelons of the victorious force ) ; and , finally , to room 3 ( scene of a dance , with observers , and ritual bloodletting ) on the east and west sides of the building , the upper course featured additional seated figures within niches set atop long-snouted god heads—these still have some remnants of red paint visible thus , it is clear that no maya noble in full regalia would have ever entered these rooms without a bow of deferential respect note : the numbered human figures ( hf ) mentioned below can be found in the aforementioned publication on page 73 , in addition to excellent large foldouts in the back of the book there are 77 human figures in this first room fulfilling various functions within the narrative behind him , hf 's 73 and 74 , as well as hf 's 52 and 54 on the east wall work together , holding parasols that frame the initial series text right above them on the middle register of all the images of visiting messengers , nobles and dancers held within the upper register , a few individuals , and one recently discovered detail in particular , stand out conspicuously placed upon a raised platform on the upper register of the south wall , just above two holes where wooden beams had once ran through to help support the structure , stands a lone figure ( hf 16 ) presenting a child ( hf 15 ) to the lords finally , in the vault across the whole scene in room 1 , the faces of the sun god are shown as it moves across the sky on the east wall , a large crocodilian , representing the vault of the sky , carries the myriad avatars of the sun god upon its back room 2 is the largest of the three , which alludes to its greater importance it also contains more human figures than either room 1 or room 2 , with 139 of them as one begins to focus more and more on the individuals , a couple of artistic elements and their symbolic meanings become clear in addition to left-handedness , the losers are also all wearing some element of a bird—or , at least those that are still in their battle costumes , and have not yet been stripped of them as one turns to view the north wall , the viewer is greeted by the sequel to the battle : torture and sacrifice of the captives taken in battle to view the north wall , a visitor would have sat on the south bench above bound captives , as though becoming a part of the scene yajaw chan muwaan is the main figure here , too , wearing only a slightly different variant of his battle costume from the south wall it contained the body of one man between the ages of 35 and 42 the last two items—perforated vase and a stone knife—lead some to believe that this individual was one of the sacrifice victims depicted in room 2 other theories include him being a wounded warrior , or a possible relative of yajaw chan muwaan , as his jewelry matched that of the nobles depicted in room 1 it is clear that this tomb was part of the original construction of structure 1 and was not , therefore , created at a later date as with rooms 1 and 2 , the south wall is the first to be viewed covering almost the entire bottom register of the south and west walls are seven more elaborately costumed characters ( hf 's 13 , 15 , 17 , 26 , 26 , 27 and 28 ) with similar headdresses to those of the brothers above them above the entire south wall scene , set among a background of yellow —the first appearance of a color not representing reality — is a supernatural entity with square eyes , and a single frontal , pointed tooth the upper register of the west wall contains a musical procession with masked performers , carrying a dwarf ( hf 42 ) who is lifted into the yellow background of the vault , demonstrating his connection to the supernatural world of note is the fact that these individuals also seem to appear previously—hf 7 in room 2 on the middle of the east wall ; the others in room 1 on the west wall throne scene turning to the north wall , one can see an almost identical supernatural in the vault as that of the south wall vault below , 10 ebeets ( lords ) dressed in white mantles engage in conversation , while nine more seated individuals below also gesticulate as they talk to one another , perhaps commenting on the performance taking place on the south wall in front of them it is located in the central part of the great plaza , it represents the moment of the height of chan muwan ii , the importance of the character is reflected in the way it is represented and in the difficulty to elaborate the monument , that is , in a huge slab of stone of little thickness without suffering any fracture chan muwan ii is standing and carrying a ceremonial cane , the styling of the pupil gives him a greater strength to his look ;
