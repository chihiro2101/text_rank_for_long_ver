as a construct and measured by measuring , intelligence is considered to be one of the most useful concepts used in psychology , because it correlates with many relevant variables , for instance the probability of suffering an accident , salary , and more however , while iq test scores show a high degree of inter-test reliability , and predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively , their construct validity as a holistic measure of human intelligence is considered dubious while iq tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence , they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence according to psychologist wayne weiten , '' iq tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work the triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor ; instead , the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence , and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood intelligence is now defined as an individual 's assessment of success in life by the individual 's own ( idiographic ) standards and within the individual 's sociocultural context attempts to raise iq with brain training have led to increases on aspects related with the training tasks – for instance working memory – but it is yet unclear if these increases generalize to increased intelligence per se a 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual n-back task can increase fluid intelligence ( gf ) , as measured in several different standard tests alexis madrigal , forget brain age : researchers develop software that makes you smarter , wired , april 2008 however , a subsequent criticism of the paper 's methodology questioned the experiment 's validity and took issue with the lack of uniformity in the tests used to evaluate the control and test groups regardless of the method used , almost any test that requires examinees to reason and has a wide range of question difficulty will produce intelligence scores that are approximately normal distribution in the general population intelligence tests are widely used in educational , business , and military settings because of their efficacy in predicting behavior some tests consist of a single type of task , others rely on a broad collection of tasks with different contents ( visual-spatial , verbal , numerical ) and asking for different cognitive processes ( e.g he interpreted it as the core of human intelligence that , to a larger or smaller degree , influences success in all cognitive tasks and thereby creates the positive manifold their mutualism model assumes that intelligence depends on several independent mechanisms , none of which influences performance on all cognitive tests one comprehensive study investigating the correlations between a large collection of tests and tasks has found that the raven 's progressive matrices have a particularly high correlation with most other tests and tasks this is problematic , however , because there are substantial gender differences on the raven 's , which are not found when g is measured directly by computing the general factor from a broad collection of tests a recent scientific understanding of collective intelligence , defined as a group 's general ability to perform a wide range of tasks , expands the areas of human intelligence research applying similar methods and concepts to groups definition , operationalization and methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence where an individual 's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure intelligence indicated by the g factor ( psychometrics ) extracted via factor analysis in the same vein , collective intelligence research aims to discover a ‘ c factor ’ explaining between-group differences in performance as well as structural and group compositional causes for it crystallized intelligence ( gc ) : includes the breadth and depth of a person 's acquired knowledge , the ability to communicate one 's knowledge , and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures modern tests do not necessarily measure of all of these broad abilities several critics , such as stephen jay gould , have been critical of g , seeing it as a statistical artifact , and that iq tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities psychology have shown that the definition of human intelligence is unique to the culture that one is studying robert sternberg is among the researchers who have discussed how one 's culture affects the person 's interpretation of intelligence , and he further believes that to define intelligence in only one way without considering different meanings in cultural contexts may cast an investigative and unintentionally egocentric view on the world to negate this , psychologists offer the following definitions of intelligence : successful intelligence is the skills and knowledge needed for success in life , according to one 's own definition of success , within one 's sociocultural context analytical intelligence is the result of intelligence 's components applied to fairly abstract but familiar kinds of problems creative intelligence is the result of intelligence 's components applied to relatively novel tasks and situations although typically identified by its western definition , multiple studies support the idea that human intelligence carries different meanings across cultures around the world one of the most common views on intelligence within american societies defines it as a combination of problem-solving skills , deductive reasoning skills , and iq ( iq ) , while other american societies point out that intelligent people should have a social conscience , accept others for who they are , and be able to give advice or wisdom
