a chordless cycle in a graph , also called a hole or an induced cycle , is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle chordless cycles may be used to characterize perfect graphs : by the strong perfect graph theorem , a graph is perfect if and only if none of its holes or antiholes have an odd number of vertices that is greater than three a peripheral cycle is a cycle in a graph with the property that every two edges not on the cycle can be connected by a path whose interior vertices avoid the cycle the most common is the binary cycle space ( usually called simply the cycle space ) , which consists of the edge sets that have even degree at every vertex ; it forms a vector space over the two-element field the existence of a cycle in directed and undirected graphs can be determined by whether depth-first search ( dfs ) finds an edge that points to an ancestor of the current vertex ( it contains a back edge ) in the case of undirected graphs , only o ( n ) time is required to find a cycle in an n-vertex graph , since at most n & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 1 edges can be tree edges in his 1736 paper on the seven bridges of königsberg , widely considered to be the birth of graph theory , leonhard euler proved that , for a finite undirected graph to have a closed walk that visits each edge exactly once , it is necessary and sufficient that it be connected except for isolated vertices ( that is , all edges are contained in one component ) and have even degree at each vertex if a finite undirected graph has even degree at each of its vertices , regardless of whether it is connected , then it is possible to find a set of simple cycles that together cover each edge exactly once : this is veblen 's theorem . much research has been published concerning classes of graphs that can be guaranteed to contain hamiltonian cycles ; one example is ore 's theorem that a hamiltonian cycle can always be found in a graph for which every non-adjacent pair of vertices have degrees summing to at least the total number of vertices in the graph . the cycle double cover conjecture states that , for every bridgeless graph , there exists a multiset of simple cycles that covers each edge of the graph exactly twice
