however , until the end of world war ii the a- designation was shared between attack planes and light bombers johnson 2008 , p the us navy used a separate designation system and at the time preferred to call similar aircraft scout bombers ( sb ) or torpedo bombers ( tb or bt ) attack missions are principally divided into two categories : air interdiction and close air support in the last several decades , the rise of the ubiquitous multi-role fighter has created some confusion about the difference between attack and fighter aircraft missions ( also known as '' attack missions '' ) , while a fighter category f incorporates not only aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat , but additionally multipurpose aircraft designed also for ground-attack missions the nato reporting names for soviet/russian ground-attack aircraft at first started with '' b '' categorizing them as bombers , as in case of il-10 'beast ' but later they were usually classified as fighters ( '' f '' ) —possibly because ( since sukhoi su-7 ) they were similar in size and visual appearance to soviet fighters , or were simply derivatives of such the attack aircraft as a role was defined by its use during world war i , in support of ground forces on battlefields though such aircraft also attacked targets in rear areas the british experimented with the sopwith tf series ( termed '' trench fighters '' ) , although these did not see combat the last battles of 1918 on the western front demonstrated that ground-attacking aircraft were a valuable component of all-arms tactics the us army engineering division became involved in designing ground attack aircraft the united states army air corps was notable for its creation of a separate '' a- '' designation for attack types , distinct from and alongside '' b- '' for bomber types and '' p- '' for pursuit ( later replaced by '' f- '' for fighter ) aircraft however , like most air arms of the period it did operate attack aircraft , named army cooperation in raf parlance , which included the hawker hector , westland lysander and others this led to some support within the luftwaffe for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role , resulting in tenders for a new '' attack aircraft '' as world war ii approached , the concept of an attack aircraft was not well defined , and various air services used many different names for widely differing types , all performing similar roles ( sometimes in tandem with non-attack roles of bombers , fighters , reconnaissance and other roles the concept was similar to front-line aircraft used in the world war i , which was called the cl class in the german empire the last british specification issued for a light bomber was b.20/40 described as a '' close army support bomber '' capable of dive bombing and photoreconnaissance ; fighter-bomber although not a synonymous class with ground-attack aircraft , fighter-bombers were usually used for the role , and proved to excel at it , even when they were only lightly armored the junkers ju 87s of the german luftwaffe became virtually synonymous with close air support during the early months of world war ii the british commonwealth 's desert air force , led by arthur tedder , became the first allied tactical formation to emphasise the attack role , usually in the form of single-engine hawker hurricane and curtiss p-40 fighter-bombers or specialized '' tank-busters '' , such as the hurricane mk iid , armed with two 40 & nbsp ; mm vickers s guns ( notably no the bristol beaufighter , based on an obsolescent raf bomber , became a versatile twin-engine attack aircraft and served in almost every theatre of the war , in the maritime strike and ground attack roles as well as that of night fighter conversely , some mid-war attack types emerged as adaptations of fighters , including several versions of the german focke-wulf fw 190 , the british hawker typhoon and the us republic p-47 thunderbolt likewise the p-47 was designed and intended for use as a high altitude bomber escort , but gradually found that role filled by the north american p-51 mustang ( because of its much longer range and greater manoeuvrability ) the p-47 was also heavier and more robust than the p-51 and regarded therefore , as an '' energy fighter '' : ideal for high-speed dive-and-climb tactics , including strafing attacks its armament of eight 0.50 caliber machine guns was effective against axis infantry and light vehicles in both europe and the pacific the ultimate development of the cannon-armed light attack aircraft was the small production run in 1944 of the henschel hs 129b-3 , armed with a modified pak 40 75 mm anti-tank gun the only other aircraft to be factory-equipped with similar guns were the 1,420 maritime strike variants of the north american b-25 mitchellg/h , which mounted either a m4 cannon , or light-weight t13e1 or m5 versions of the same gun the higher powered piston engine types that had been too late for world war ii were still capable of holding their own against the jets as they were able to both out accelerate and out manoeuver the jets many post-world war ii era air forces have been reluctant to adopt fixed-wing jet aircraft developed specifically for ground attack ground attack has increasingly become a task of converted trainers , like the bae systems hawk or aero l-39 albatros , and many trainers are built with this task in mind , like the casa c-101 or the aermacchi mb-339 a proliferation of low intensity conflicts in the post-world war ii era has also expanded need for these types of aircraft to conduct counter-insurgency and light ground attack operations air force was that latter had generally been allocated all fixed-wing aircraft , while helicopters were under control of the former ; this was governed by the 1948 key west agreement according to the army times , '' tradoc cuts apaches ’ role in deep attack '' general : deep-strike , urban tactics for attack helicopters may need rreview the soviets ' similar sukhoi su-25 ( frogfoot ) found success in the '' flying artillery '' role with many air forces a pattern for joint operations : world war ii close air support , north africa
