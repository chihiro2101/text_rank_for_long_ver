however , if this aspiration leads one to believe that there is only one way to understand our intellectual commitments , whether about the external world , knowledge , or what our practical and moral reasons ought to be , this leads one into error a modern scientific understanding is one way of thinking about the world and our place in it that is more objective than the common sense view it replaces despite what may seem like skepticism about the objective claims of science , nagel does not dispute that science describes the world that exists independently of us his contention , rather , is that a given way of understanding a subject matter should not be regarded as better simply for being more objective one learns and uses mental concepts by being directly acquainted with one 's own mind , whereas any attempt to think more objectively about mentality would abstract away from this fact being a thinker is to have a subjective perspective on the world ; if one abstracts away from this perspective one leaves out what he sought to explain nagel thinks that philosophers – over-impressed by the paradigm of the kind of objective understanding represented by modern science – tend to produce philosophy of mind that are falsely objectifying in precisely this kind of way they are right to be impressed – modern science really is objective – but are wrong to take modern science to be the only paradigm of objectivity the kind of understanding that science represents does not transfer to everything that people would like to understand as a philosophical rationalism , nagel believes that a proper understanding of the place of mental properties in nature will involve a revolution in our understanding of both the physical and the mental , and that this is a reasonable prospect that people can anticipate in the near future in both cases they ask people to take up an interpretative perspective to making sense of other speakers in the context of a shared , objective world nagel claims this is no better than more orthodox forms of idealism in which reality is claimed to be made up of mental items or claimed to be constitutively dependent on a form supplied by the mind nagel is probably most widely known within the field of philosophy of mind as an advocate of the idea that consciousness and subjective experience can not , at least with the contemporary understanding of physicalism , be satisfactorily explained using the current concepts of physics his critics have objected strongly to what they see as a misguided attempt to argue from a fact about how one represents the world ( trivially , one can only do so from his own point of view ) to a false claim about the world , that it somehow has first personal perspectives built into it this is , however , a misunderstanding : nagel 's point is that there is a constraint on what it is to possess the concept of a mental state , namely , that one be directly acquainted with it concepts of mental states are only made available to a thinker who can be acquainted with his/her own states ; clearly , the possession and use of physical concepts has no corresponding constraint part of the puzzlement here is because of the limitations of imagination : influenced by his princeton colleague , saul kripke , nagel believes that any type identity statement that identifies a physical state type with a mental state type would be , if true , logical truth ) this argument that there will always be an explanatory gap between an identification of a state in mental and physical terms is compounded , nagel argues , by the fact that imagination operates in two distinct ways these two ways of imagining the two terms of the identity statement are so different that there will always seem to be an explanatory gap , whether or not this is the case but his skepticism is about current physics : he envisages in his most recent work that people may be close to a scientific breakthrough in identifying an underlying essence that is neither physical ( as people currently think of the physical ) , nor functional , nor mental , but such that it necessitates all three of these ways in which the mind '' appears '' to us in his 2012 book mind and cosmos , nagel argues against a materialism view of the emergence of life and consciousness , writing that the standard neo-darwinism view flies in the face of common sense nagel has argued that id should not be rejected as non-scientific , for instance writing in 2008 that '' id is very different from creation science , '' and that the debate about id '' is clearly a scientific disagreement , not a disagreement between science and something else according to motivated desire theory , when a person is motivated to moral action it is indeed true that such actions are motivated – like all intentional actions – by a belief and a desire nagel contrasts this view with a rival view which believes that a moral agent can only accept that he or she has a reason to act if the desire to carry out the action has an independent justification the most striking claim of the book is that there is a very close parallel between prudential reasoning in one 's own interests and moral reasons to act to further the interests of another person when one reasons prudentially , for example about the future reasons that one will have , one allows the reason in the future to justify one 's current action without reference to the strength of one 's current desires the denial of this view of prudence , nagel argues , means that one does not really believe that one is one and the same person through time comparable to the views of the nineteenth century moral philosopher henry sidgwick , nagel believes that one needs to conceive of one 's good as an impersonal good and one 's reasons as objective reasons nagel 's later work on ethics ceases to place as much weight on the distinction between a person 's personal or '' subjective '' reasons and his or her '' objective '' reasons earlier , in the possibility of altruism , he took the stance that if one 's reasons really are about intrinsic and timeless values then , qua subjective reason , one can only take them to be the guise of the reasons that there really are – the objective ones in later discussions , nagel treats his former view as an incomplete attempt to convey the fact that there are distinct classes of reasons and values , and speaks instead of '' agent-relative '' and '' agent-neutral '' reasons '' by contrast , in the case of agent-neutral reasons ( the successor to objective reasons ) specifying the content of the reason does not make any essential reference back to the person for whom it is a reason , agent-relative and agent-neutral ) emphasized in nagel 's later work are situated within a sidgwickian model in which one 's moral commitments are thought of objectively , such that one 's personal reasons and values are simply incomplete parts of an impersonal whole the structure of nagel 's later ethical view is that all reasons must be brought into relation to this objective view of oneself however , the most striking part of the earlier argument and of sidgwick 's view is preserved : agent-neutral reasons are literally reasons for anyone , so all objectifiable reasons become individually possessed no matter whose they are thinking reflectively about ethics from this standpoint , one must take every other agent 's standpoint on value as seriously as one 's own , since one 's own perspective is just a subjective take on an inter-subjective whole ; one 's personal set of reasons is thus swamped by the objective reasons of all others this is similar to '' world agent '' consequentialist views in which one takes up the standpoint of a collective subject whose reasons are those of everyone he provides an extended rationale for the importance to people of their personal point of view the extent to which one can lead a good life as an individual while respecting the demands of others leads inevitably to political philosophy once again , nagel places such weight on the objective point of view and its requirements that he finds rawls 's view of liberal equality not demanding enough in his work mind and cosmos , nagel notes that he is an atheist , writing , '' i lack the sensus divinitatis that enablesindeed compelsso many people to see in the world the expression of divine purpose as naturally as they see in a smiling face the expression of human feeling nagel has said that '' there are elements which , if added to one 's experience , make life better ; there are other elements which if added to one 's experience , make life worse the situation is roughly this : there are elements which , it added to one 's experience , make life better ; there are other elements which if added to one 's experience , make life worse
