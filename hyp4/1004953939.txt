in 1885 , auer von welsbach used a method of fractional crystallization that he had developed himself to separate the alloy didymium into its two parts , for the first time in naming both elements , and not leaving the original name didymium to the more-abundant component , auer von welsbach diverged from established practice , which was to give a new name only to the less-abundant component nonetheless , his name for the major fraction , neodidymium , after some modification , became the name of the element neodymium the rare earth element lutetium was independently discovered by three scientists at around the same time in 1907 : french scientist georges urbain , austrian auer von welsbach , and american charles james these original mantles gave off a green-tinted light and were not very successful , and his first company formed to sell them failed in 1889 in 1890 he introduced a new form of the mantle based on a mixture of 99 % thorium dioxide and 1 % cerium ( iv ) oxide , which he developed in collaboration with his colleague ludwig haitinger another company founded to produce the newer design was formed in 1891 , working with fellow student from the university ignaz kreidl , and the device quickly spread throughout europe in the united states this technique was adopted by the coleman company and became their logo for the company the company changed its formulation to use non-radioactive materials , which apparently cost less and last longer although originally intended to be a new mantle , it was during this period that electricity was being introduced into the market , and he started experimenting with ways to use the filaments as a replacement for the electric arc lamp he worked on this until finally developing a workable technique in 1898 and started a new factory to produce his auer-oslight , which he introduced commercially in 1902 it takes its name from its two primary components : iron ( from , and the rare-earth element cerium it is also known in europe as '' auermetall '' after its inventor three different auermetalls were developed : the first was iron and cerium , the second also included lanthanum to produce brighter sparks , and the third added other heavy metals he published a number of papers on chemical separation and spectroscopy , working on radioactive elements as early as 1904 in 1910 , one of his companies helped to establish vienna as a center of radiation research by producing the first major quantity of radium chloride ( 3-4 grams ) in europe
