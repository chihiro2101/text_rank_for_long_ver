in contrast , flank eruptions can occur down to a few hundred metres altitude , close to or even well within the inhabited areas since the year ad & nbsp ; 1600 , at least 60 flank eruptions and countless summit eruptions have occurred ; nearly half of these have happened since the start of the 20th century volcanic activity first took place at etna about 500,000 years ago , with eruptions occurring beneath the sea off the ancient coastline of sicily about 300,000 & nbsp ; years ago , volcanism began occurring to the southwest of the summit ( centre top of the volcano ) , then activity moved towards the present centre 170,000 & nbsp ; years ago the growth of the mountain was occasionally interrupted by major eruptions , leading to the collapse of the summit to form calderas ash from these eruptions has been found as far away as south of rome 's border , to the north thousands of years ago , the eastern flank of the mountain experienced a catastrophic collapse , generating an enormous landslide in an event similar to that seen in the 1980 eruption of mount st research published in 2006 suggested this occurred around 8,000 years ago , and caused a huge tsunami , which left its mark in several places in the eastern mediterranean the most recent collapse event at the summit of etna is thought to have occurred about 2,000 & nbsp ; years ago , forming what is known as the piano caldera this caldera has been almost entirely filled by subsequent lava eruptions but is still visible as a distinct break in the slope of the mountain near the base of the present-day summit cone a particularly violent explosive ( plinian ) summit eruption occurred in 122 & nbsp ; bc , and caused heavy tephra falls to the southeast , including the town of catania , where many roofs collapsed 1908 book iii , lines 569–579 during the first 1500 years ad , many eruptions went unrecorded ( or records have been lost ) ; among the more significant are : ( 1 ) an eruption in about 1030 ad near monte ilice on the lower southeast flank , which produced a lava flow that travelled about 10 & nbsp ; km , reaching the sea north of acireale ; the villages of santa tecla and stazzo are built on the broad delta built by this lava flow into the sea ; ( 2 ) an eruption in about 1160 ( or 1224 ) , from a fissure at only elevation on the south-southeast flank near the village of mascalucia , whose lava flow reached the sea just to the north of catania , in the area now occupied by the portion of the city named ognina the history of the life and travels of rabban sawma the 1669 eruption , etna 's most destructive since 122 & nbsp ; bc , started on 11 march 1669 and produced lava flows that destroyed at least 10 villages on its southern flank before reaching the city walls of the town of catania five weeks later , on 15 april see also : mention no deaths related to the 1669 eruption ( but give very precise figures of the number of buildings destroyed , the area of cultivated land lost , and the economic damage ) one possibility is confusion between this eruption and an earthquake that devastated southeast sicily ( including catania ) 24 years later in 1693 a large lava flow from an eruption in 1928 led to the destruction of a population centre for the first time since the 1669 eruption in 1971 , lava buried the etna observatory ( built in the late 19th century ) , destroyed the first generation of the etna cable-car , and seriously threatened several small villages on etna 's east flank that eruption was remarkably similar to one in 1928 that destroyed mascali the 1991–1993 eruption saw the town of zafferana threatened by a lava flow , but successful diversion efforts saved the town with the loss of only one building a few hundred metres from the town 's margin following six years ( 1995–2001 ) of unusually intense activity at the four summit craters of etna , the volcano produced its first flank eruption since 1991–1993 in july–august 2001 this eruption , which involved activity from seven distinct eruptive fissures mostly on the south slope of the volcano , was well covered by the mass-media because it occurred at the height of the tourist season and numerous reporters and journalists were already in italy to cover the g8 genoa it also occurred close to one of the tourist areas on the volcano , and thus was easily accessible part of the '' etna sud '' tourist area , including the arrival station of the etna cable car , were damaged by this eruption , which otherwise was a rather modest-sized event by etna standards in 2002–2003 , a much larger eruption threw up a huge column of ash that could easily be seen from space and fell as far away as libya , south across the mediterranean sea on 4 september 2007 , a major episode of lava fountaining occurred from the new vent on the east side of the southeast crater , also producing a plume of ash and scoriae which fell over the east flank of the volcano this eruption was visible far into the plains of sicily , ending the following morning between the hours of 5 to 7 a.m an eruption on the morning of 13 may 2008 , immediately to the east of etna 's summit craters was accompanied by a swarm of more than 200 earthquakes and significant ground deformation in the summit area lava flows advanced 6.5 & nbsp ; km during the first few days of this eruption but thereafter stagnated at many minor distances from the vents ; during the last months of the eruption lava rarely advanced more than 1 & nbsp ; km downslope the july 2011 episode also endangered the sapienza refuge , the main tourist hub on the volcano , but the lava flow was successfully diverted in the 1970s etna erupted smoke rings , one of the first captured events of this type , which are extremely rare
