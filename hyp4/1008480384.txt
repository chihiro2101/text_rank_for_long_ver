the main component of any windowing system is usually called the display server , although alternative denominations such as window server or compositor are also in use the display server and its clients communicate with each other over a communications protocol , which is usually called display server protocol , the display server being the mediator between the clients and the user the output of sound is usually not managed by the display server , but the sound volume is usually handled through gui applets and it is the display server who decides which applications are on top a windowing system enables the computer user to work with several programs at the same time it provides an abstraction of the graphics hardware for use by higher-level elements of the graphical interface such as a window manager a display server or window server is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system , the hardware , and each other the display server is a key component in any graphical user interface , specifically the windowing system the display server also receives data from its clients ; it processes the data , it does the compositing and on linux it passes the data to one of three kernel components & ndash ; drm , gem or kms driver one of the implementations of display server concept is x window system , in particular its actually used version & ndash ; x.org server and xlib and xcb client libraries google developed a display server called surfaceflinger for android ( another linux kernel-based operating system primarily for mobile devices ) : everything in android is rendered to a '' surface '' ; '' surfaces '' are produced by applications and placed into a queue that is managed by surfaceflinger for microsoft windows , from windows vista onward , desktop window manager enables the use of hardware acceleration to render the graphical user interface it is also included with windows server 2008 , but requires the '' desktop experience '' feature and compatible graphics drivers to be installed
