the may 25 , 1907 , edition of electrical world in an article called '' wireless and lawless '' reported authorities were unable to prevent an amateur from interfering with the operation of a government station at the washington , d.c in the usa when the '' act to regulate radio communication '' was passed on august 13 , 1912 , amateurs and experimenters were not banned from broadcasting ; rather , amateurs were assigned their own frequency spectrum , and licensing and call sign were introduced the radio act of 1912 gave the president legal permission to shut down radio stations '' in time of war '' , and during the first two and a half years of world war i , before us entry , woodrow wilson tasked the us navy with monitoring us radio stations , nominally to '' ensure neutrality in 1926 , wjaz in chicago changed its frequency to one previously reserved for canadian stations without getting permission to make the change , and was charged by the federal government with '' wave piracy '' while mexico issued radio station xerf with a license to broadcast , the power of its 250 kw transmitter was far greater than the maximum of 50 & nbsp ; kw authorized for commercial use by the government of the united states of america consequently , xerf and many other radio stations in mexico , which sold their broadcasting time to sponsors of english-language commercial and religious programs , were labelled as '' border blasters '' , but not '' pirate radio stations '' , even though the content of many of their programs could not have been aired by a us-regulated broadcaster in europe , denmark had the first known radio station in the world to broadcast commercial radio from a vessel in international waters without permission from the authorities in the country that it broadcast to ( denmark in this case ) in the 1960s in the uk , the term referred to not only a perceived unauthorized use of the state-run spectrum by the unlicensed broadcasters but also the risk-taking nature of offshore radio stations that actually operated on anchored ships or marine platforms the term had been used previously in britain and the us to describe unlicensed land-based broadcasters and even border blasters ( for example , a 1940 british comedy about an unauthorized tv broadcaster , band waggon , uses the phrase '' pirate station '' several times ) therefore , as far as the british authorities were concerned , radio luxembourg was a '' pirate radio station '' and british listeners to the station were breaking the law ( although as the term 'unauthorised ' was never properly defined it was somewhat of a legal grey area ) radio luxembourg was later joined by other well-known pirate stations received in the uk in violation of uk licensing , including radio caroline and radio atlanta ( subsequently radio carolines north and south respectively , following their merger and the original ship 's relocation ) , radio london and laser 558 , all of which broadcast from vessels anchored outside of territorial limits and were therefore legitimate free radio was used only to refer to radio transmissions that were beyond government control , as was offshore radio in the uk and europe the term free radio was adopted by the free radio association of listeners who defended the rights of the offshore radio stations broadcasting from ships and marine structures off the coastline of the united kingdom f√©lix guattari points out : in europe , in addition to adopting the term free radio , supportive listeners of what had been called pirate radio adopted the term offshore radio , which was usually the term used by the owners of the marine broadcasting stations propaganda broadcasting may be authorized by the government at the transmitting site , but may be considered unwanted or illegal by the government of the intended reception area
