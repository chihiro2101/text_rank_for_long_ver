an estimated 60 % of people infected with the fungi responsible for coccidioidomycosis have minimal to no symptoms , while 40 % will have a range of possible clinical symptoms fatigue can persist for many months after initial infection a minority ( 3 % -5 % ) of infected individuals do not recover from the initial acute infection and develop a chronic infection osteomyelitis , including involvement of the spine , and meningitis may occur months to years after initial infection severe lung disease may develop in hiv-infected persons serious complications may occur in patients who have weakened immune systems , including severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and bronchopleural fistulas requiring resection , lung nodules , and possible disseminated form , where the infection spreads throughout the body rupture of spherules release these endospores , which in turn repeat the cycle and spread the infection to adjacent tissues within the body of the infected individual in individuals with a weakened immune system , the infection can spread fungemia preventing valley fever is challenging because it is difficult to avoid breathing in the fungus should it be present ; however , the public health effect of the disease is essential to understand in areas where the fungus is endemic currently there are no completely effective preventive measures available for people who live or travel through valley fever -endemic areas the use of air filtration indoors is also helpful , in addition to keeping skin injuries clean and covered to avoid skin infection the united states ' centers for disease control and prevention called the disease a '' silent epidemic '' and acknowledged that there is no proven anticoccidioidal vaccine available research demonstrates that patients from endemic areas who are aware of the disease are most likely to request diagnostic testing for coccidioidomycosis significant disease develops in fewer than 5 % of those infected and typically occurs in those with a weakened immune system those with severe symptoms may benefit from antifungal therapy , which requires 3–6 months or more of treatment depending on the response to the treatment because the symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are similar to the common flu , pneumonia , and other respiratory diseases , it is important for public health professionals to be aware of the rise of coccidioidomycosis and the specifics of diagnosis greyhound dogs often get coccidioidomycosis as well , and their treatment regimen involves 6–12 months of ketoconazole , to be taken with food conventional amphotericin b desoxycholate ( amb : used since the 1950s as a primary agent ) is known to be associated with increased drug-induced nephrotoxicity ( kidney toxicity ) impairing renal function while the majority of cases are observed in the endemic region , cases reported outside the area are generally visitors , who contact the infection and return to their native areas before becoming symptomatic an estimated 150,000 infections occur annually , with 25,000 new infections occurring every year in area where it is most prevalent , the infection rate is 2-4 % infection rates vary greatly by county , and although population density is important , so are other factors that have not been proven yet there are several populations that have a higher risk for contracting coccidioidomycosis and developing the advanced disseminated version of the disease historically , an infection is more likely to occur in males than females , although this could be attributed to occupation rather than being sex-specific there is also an association between stage of pregnancy and severity of the disease , with third trimester women being more likely to develop dissemination individuals with a weakened immune system are also more susceptible to the disease individuals with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes are also at a higher risk age also affects the severity of the disease , with more than one-third of deaths being in the 65-84 age group posadas established an infectious character of the disease after being able to transfer it in laboratory conditions to lab animals smith that was able to detect an acute form of the infection medical research suggested that oc might have had some lethal effects on the populace , and coccidioides immitis started to be classified by the authorities as a threat to public health department of health and human services ' or centers for disease control and prevention list of select agents and toxins the disease can disseminate throughout the dog 's body , most commonly causing osteomyelitis ( infection of the bone ) , which leads to lameness
