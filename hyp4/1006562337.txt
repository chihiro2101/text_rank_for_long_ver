the distance of the river from its source to its confluence , has been variously reported as being between and this uncertainty might result from the fact that the river flows through a series of virtually impenetrable gorges cut in the ethiopian highlands to a depth of some —a depth comparable to that of the grand canyon of the colorado river in the united states the river flows generally south before entering a canyon about long , about from lake tana , which is a tremendous obstacle for travel and communication between north and south ethiopia the canyon was first referred to as the '' grand canyon '' in 1968 by a british team that accomplished the first descent of the river from lake tana to the end of the canyon ; subsequent river rafting parties called it the '' grand canyon of the nile '' the blue nile falls ( amharic : tis abay , literally '' great smoke '' ) , one of ethiopia 's biggest tourist attractions , is located at the start of the canyon although there are several feeder streams that flow into lake tana , the sacred source of the river is generally considered to be a small spring at gish abay , situated at an elevation of approximately , known as the gilgel abay ( lesser abay river ) the first european to have seen the blue nile in ethiopia and the river 's source was pedro páez , a spanish jesuit who reached the river 's source on 21 april 1618 although a number of european explorers contemplated tracing the course of the nile from the blue nile 's confluence with the white nile to lake tana , its gorge , which begins a few kilometres inside the ethiopian border , has discouraged all attempts since frédéric cailliaud 's attempt in 1821 cheesman , who records his surprise on arriving in ethiopia at finding that the upper waters of '' one of the most famous of the rivers of the world , and one whose name was well known to the ancients '' was in his lifetime '' marked on the map by dotted lines '' , managed to map the upper course of the blue nile between 1925 and 1933 he did this not by following the river along its banks and through its impassable canyon , but following it from the highlands above , travelling some by mule in the adjacent country in both 2001 and 2009 , bridges to prosperity volunteers travelled from the united states to repair the broken bridge across the blue nile and later built a new suspension bridge not susceptible to flood new york : new american library , 2005 on 29 january 2005 , canadian les jickling and his teammate new zealander mark tanner completed the first fully human-powered transit of the entire blue nile and nile in the sudan and egypt
