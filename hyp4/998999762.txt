the bulk of development work on the new launcher occurred between 1980 and 1982 in order to keep costs down , cnes directed that only tested technologies could be implemented in the launcher 's improvements ; in fact , no budget was provided for new test series to be performed however , one new piece of infrastructure that was permitted was the establishment of tracking equipment in the ivory coast ; the existing infrastructure based in brazil used by the ariane 1 was less suitable due to the increased performance of the ariane 3 , which flew a different ascent profile that reached 250km , rather than 200km before coasting into orbit the second stage was powered by a viking 4b , which used the same fuel-oxidiser combination the ariane 3 's design heavily influenced that of its successor , the ariane 4 ; while the design team considered various approaches for achieving such a launcher , one of the studied concepts had involved the addition of a fifth engine to an enlarged first stage of the ariane 3 however , this was determined to have involved a very high level of redesign work ; an alternative approach was instead adopted , in which the first stage was elongated to hold 210 tonnes of propellant instead of the 145 tonnes present on the ariane 3 while the second and third stages of the ariane 4 remained identical to the ariane 3 , a range of strap-on boosters were developed to be applied to the type , designed to gradually increase the rocket 's payload capacity this was perhaps even more daring as not only was this flight using a new launcher but also the new capability to launch two satellites at once at the time of the ariane 3 's maiden flight , the united states still held a majority of the global launcher market ; by the end of the year , the order books were shifting in favour of the ariane family , having outstanding orders to launch 30 satellites at a cumulative cost of â‚¬1 billion according to harvey , the ariane family had become the dominant series of launchers on the world market as early as 1986
