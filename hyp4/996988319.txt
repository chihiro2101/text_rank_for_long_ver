there is a choice of route to reach the grand union , as there are two locks side by side , one on the main line of the canal , and one on the branch , but a channel joins the bottom ends of both locks near king 's norton junction there is a disused stop lock , which used to prevent the canal taking water from the worcester and birmingham canal when they were separately owned , but is now left permanently open the northern section also has a swing bridge ( no.2 , normally left open ) , a lift bridge ( no.28 ) , and another drawbridge ( no the southern section of the canal passes over three cast iron aqueducts , unusual in that the towpaths are at the level of the canal bottom the stratford-upon-avon canal was conceived as part of a network of canals which would allow coal from the dudley canal and the stourbridge canal to reach oxford and london , without having to use the birmingham canals , the management of which was seen as high-handed the route would take it close to warwick and birmingham canal at lapworth , but the act did not include any provision for a direct connection with it , or with the river avon at stratford negotiations started with the warwick and birmingham , and to second act was obtained on 19 may 1795 , to allow a connecting link to be built , despite rather unfavourable terms imposed on through traffic by the other company he was also working on the dudley canal 's extension , and another four canal schemes at the same time , and was the first great tunnel engineer he died in december of the following year , but work continued until the main line reached hockley heath in may 1796 , one mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) short of the first lock at lapworth the dudley canal extension through the lapal tunnel was opened in early 1798 , and with progress being made on the warwick and birmingham canal , the company obtained a third act of parliament on 21 june 1799 , which allowed it to raise more money , and included a diversion of the route further to the east near lapworth , so that the length of the connecting link to the warwick and birmingham was only about james , who had owned shares in the company since 1793 , had a wide interest in turnpike roads and railways , and following a tour of the north of england between 1802 and 1804 , on which he investigated railways and canals , he expanded his business interests to include coal mining he wanted to create a through route between the river severn and the midlands , and so the canal company obtained a further act of parliament on 12 may 1815 , which authorised a connection between the canal and the avon at stratford , as well as enabling them to build reservoirs at earlswood for a while the upper river was managed by a syndicate of seven people , all connected with the canal , and the canal company took out a lease of it from 1842 for five years another change of ownership occurred in 1863 , when the railway company was absorbed by the great western railway by the late 1930s the southern section had become derelict , although a water supply was maintained , which the gwr used to supply its engine shed in stratford despite difficulties with the state of the canal , and the fact that the accompanying boat provided by the gwr got stuck , the bridge was reached by the 1950s , the southern section was un-navigable by canal boats , as several of the locks could not be operated , and some of the small pounds between the locks of the wilmcote flight were dry two canoeists , who had used the canal recently , produced a dated toll ticket for their journey , which was offered as proof that the canal was not disused ten years after the re-opening , the queen mother performed the same ceremony for the upper avon navigation , which had been derelict for more than a century , and the canal became part of a through route to the river severn once more
