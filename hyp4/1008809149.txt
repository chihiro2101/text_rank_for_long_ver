single '' love meeting love '' brought the band to the attention of polydor records , with whom they signed their second recording contract it provided them with their first uk top ten hit , '' the sun goes down ( living it up ) '' the latter was a top 20 hit in britain and a top 5 hit in the netherlands where the band became popular ( the song reached also no by this time , the band were well established in their mainstream pop/rock sound , as evidenced on their next studio album , world machine , released later in 1985 elements of level 42 's roots could still be found in the funky '' coup d'état '' and '' dream crazy '' on the uk version of the album , as well as a long instrumental track named '' hell , '' which was also recorded during the world machine sessions ( this last track did not see the light of day until the early 2000s as an mp3 download on the original napster ) '' during the recording of the album , the first major tensions between phil gould and mark king began to surface over musical direction , production and their personal relationship '' lessons in love '' became the lead single on 1987 's running in the family album , recorded to capitalise on the impact by now a leading british pop band , level 42 played at the prince 's trust concert in june 1987 , with eric clapton standing in on lead guitar for a performance of '' running in the family ''

dates were recorded for what would become the band 's second live album , live at wembley ( eventually released in 1996 ) at the time , his previous band go west had been stalled by internal disagreements , and one of murphy 's reasons for joining level 42 was to ensure that he spent his last days playing the music that he loved the album features the only track entirely written by husband – '' if you were mine '' – which also featured on the '' guaranteed '' single release however , the album did not get good reviews in the uk ( despite reaching no although he did not play on

tracks at live shows king announced the return of level 42 with a new line-up which also happened to be the musicians from his current live band : himself , husband , connah , freeman and nathan king while not recording any new material , for the next few years the band settled into a regular pattern of touring and playing old hits two rockpalast shows from 1983 and 1984 were released on dvd , followed by two cd releases : the river sessions ( a live show from 1983 recorded in scotland ) and a new compilation called the ultimate collection ii the latter included a new song called '' genius
