temperateness is less extreme than most of the united kingdom because of the adjacent sea the azores high influences the southwest of england 's summer weather , but convection cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine the moors and levels , formed from a submerged and reclaimed landscape , consist of a coastal clay belt only slightly above mean sea level , with an inland peat belt at a lower level behind it early attempts to control the water levels were possibly made by the romans ( although records only date from the 13th & nbsp ; century ) , but were not widespread there was a port at bleadney on the river axe in the 8th & nbsp ; century which allowed goods to be brought to within of wells the domesday book recorded that drainage of the higher grounds was under way , although the moors at wedmoor were said to be useless efforts to control flooding on the parrett were recorded around the same date another accomplishment in the middle ages was the construction of the tidal pillrow cut , joining the brue and axe it is unclear why windmills were not employed , as they were on the fens of east anglia , but only two examples have been recorded on the levels : one at bleadon at the mouth of the river axe , where a sea wall had been built , and the other at common moor north of glastonbury , which was being drained following a private act of parliament in 1721 the man-made river huntspill was constructed during world war ii with sluices at both ends to provide a guaranteed daily supply of of '' process water '' it was intended that in the summer , when water supply was lower , it would serve as a reservoir with water pumped from the moors ; and in winter serve as a drainage channel , via gravity drainage geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity-drainage of the moors was not possible : thus , water is pumped up into the river throughout the year water levels are managed by the levels internal drainage boards ( idbs ) ; the levels are not as intensively drained or farmed as the east anglian fens , historically a similar area of low marsh one of the approaches to reducing the risk of flooding within the catchment area of the parrett is the planting of new woodlands in spring , the water is drained away to enable the land to be used as pasture during the summer the levels were frequently flooded by the sea during high tides , a problem that was not resolved until the sea defences were enhanced in the early 20th & nbsp ; century in addition , the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the parrett , which is the only river in the levels and moors that does not have a clyse on it although there was no loss of life , the resultant flooding covered of land , affecting 1,072 houses and commercial properties , with £150,000 worth of livestock killed and £50,000 of feed and grain destroyed construction work started in 1983 on a £7m scheme , creating what was then britain 's biggest sea wall types in 1872 , another flood covered and in 1919 , were inundated with sea water , poisoning the land for up to 7 & nbsp ; years with rising sea levels , the work required to maintain the sea defences is likely to become more expensive , and it has been proposed that two inland seas be created although the environment agency have made plans for the regular winter flooding , still in recent years this has resulted in a number of villages & nbsp ; — including muchelney and westonzoyland — being cut off at this time , with of agricultural land having been under water for over a month , the village of thorney had been abandoned and muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month such plan would likely include the dredging of the rivers tone and parrett , and possibly a later sluice near bridgwater subsequent winter flooding probably led to prehistoric man 's using the levels only in the summer , hence the county of somerset may derive its name from sumorsaete , meaning land of the summer people the neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the sweet and post tracks the levels contain the best-preserved prehistoric village in the uk , glastonbury lake village , as well as two others at meare lake village investigation of the meare pool indicates that it was formed by the encroachment of raised bog , particularly during the subatlantic climatic period ( 1st millennium bc ) , and core sample demonstrates that it is filled with at least of detritus mud clay was later spread over the peat , providing raised stands for occupation , industry and movement , and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated hearths built of clay or stone a number of anglo-saxon charters document the incorporation of areas of moor in estates , suggesting that the area continued to be exploited however , over 60 % of somerset 's orchards have been lost in the last fifty years ; and apple production occupies less than 0.4 % of the land other local industries that once thrived on the levels , such as thatching ( using reeds ) and basket making ( using willow ) , have been in decline since the second half of the 20th century in 2010 and 2011 , two proposals to build a total of 14 wind turbines , with ecotricity to build five or four adjacent to the m5 motorway near brent knoll and électricité de france to build nine at east huntspill , are opposed by local groups on the grounds of their effect on the local environment and potential damage to the bird population willow has been cut and used on the levels since mankind moved into the area the extraction of peat from the moors is known to have taken place during roman times , and has been carried out since the levels were first drained the resulting reduction in water levels put local ecosystems at risk ; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1–3 & nbsp ; feet ( 0.3–0.8 & nbsp ; m ) over 100 & nbsp ; years peat extraction continues today , although much reduced in 2010 , a project was started to reintroduce the common crane to the levels , after an absence of 400 & nbsp ; years the levels contain 32 & nbsp ; site of special scientific interest ( 12 of them also special protection areas ) , the river huntspill and bridgwater bay national nature reserves , the somerset levels and moors ramsar site covering about , the somerset levels national nature reserve , shapwick heath , ham wall national nature reserve and numerous scheduled monuments it is one of an increasing number of landscape scale conservation projects in the uk following purchase of land by the national heritage memorial fund , and installation of a water pumping and distribution system along a section , several hundred metres of the track 's length are now being actively conserved maintaining a high water table and saturating the site ) is rare a section , which lies within the land owned by the nature conservancy council , has been surrounded by a clay bank to prevent drainage into surrounding lower peat fields , and water levels are regularly monitored the site offers much information on iron age finds , round houses , and ancient highways , the post track and sweet track
