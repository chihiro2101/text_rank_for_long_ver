the transport system that existed before the canals were built consisted of coastal shipping and horses and carts struggling along mostly unsurfaced mud roads ( although there were some surfaced turnpike roads ) there was also a small amount of traffic carried along navigable rivers one horse-drawn canal barge could carry about thirty tonnes at a time , faster than road transport and at half the cost thacker the thames highway : volume ii locks and weirs 1920 - republished 1968 david & charles the net effect of these was to bring most of england , with the notable exceptions of birmingham and staffordshire , within of a waterway by the early 18th century , river navigations such as the aire and calder navigation were becoming quite sophisticated , with pound locks and longer and longer '' cuts '' ( some with intermediate locks ) to avoid circuitous or difficult stretches of rivers eventually , the experience of building long multi-level cuts with their own locks gave rise to the idea of building a '' pure '' canal , a waterway designed on the basis of where goods needed to go , not where a river happened to be the navigable water network grew rapidly at first and became an almost completely connected transport network in addition to the building of new canals , older canals were improved the sankey canal was the first british canal of the industrial revolution , opening in 1757 the bridgewater canal reduced the price of coal in manchester by nearly two-thirds within a year of its opening the 19th century saw some major new canals such as the caledonian canal and the manchester ship canal this horse-drawn system proved to be highly economical and became standard across the british canal network for many years , a dispute about tolls meant that goods travelling through birmingham had to be moved from boats in one canal to boats in the other on the majority of british canals , the canal-owning companies did not own or run a fleet of boats , since the acts of parliament setting them up usually prohibited this , in order to prevent monopolies developing trains could not only carry more than the canals but could transport people and goods far more quickly than the walking pace of the canal boats most of the investment that had previously gone into canal building was diverted into railway building by the second half of the 19th century , many canals were increasingly becoming owned by railway company or competing with them , and many were in decline , with decreases in mile-ton charges to try to remain competitive after this , the less successful canals ( particularly narrow-locked canals , whose boats could only carry about thirty tons ) failed quickly canal companies were unable to compete against the speed of the new railways , and in order to survive , they had to slash their prices this became standard practice across the canal system , with in many cases families with several children living in tiny boat cabins , creating a considerable community of boat people by the 1850s the railway system had become well established and the amount of cargo carried on the canals had fallen by nearly two-thirds , lost mostly to railway competition sometimes this was a tactical move by railway companies to gain ground in their competitors ' territory , but sometimes canal companies were bought out either to close them down and remove competition , or to build a railway on the line of the canal the canals survived through the 19th century largely by occupying the niches in the transport market that the railways had missed , or by supplying local markets such as the coal-hungry factories and mills of the big cities during the 19th century in much of continental europe the canal systems of many countries such as france , germany and the netherlands were modernised and widened to take much larger boats this canal modernisation never occurred on a large scale in the uk , mainly because of the power of the railway companies who owned most of the canals and saw no reason to invest in a competing form of transport the 20th century brought competition from road haulage , and the network declined further the transport act 1968 required the british waterways board to keep commercial waterways fit for commercial use , and cruising waterways fit for cruising british waterways could also change the classification of an existing waterway all or part of the canals could be transferred to local authorities ; this transfer subsequently allowed roads to be built over them , mitigating the need to build expensive bridges and aqueducts although out of commercial or leisure use , many canals survived because they formed part of local water supply and drainage networks from the 1970s , increasing numbers of closed canals were restored by enthusiast volunteers the canal and river trust maintains a list of the sites it believes are the most important ; it is called the seven wonders of the waterways this decision would in later years make the canal network economically uncompetitive for freight transport , and by the mid 20th century it was no longer possible to work a thirty-tonne load economically at the other extreme stop locks have little or no change in level but were built to conserve water where one canal joined another waterway restoration organisations have returned many hundreds of miles of abandoned and remainder canals to use , and work is still ongoing to save many more many restoration projects have been led by local canal societies or trusts , who were initially formed to fight the closure of a remainder waterway or to save an abandoned canal from further decay today the great majority of canals in england and wales are managed by the canal & river trust which , unlike its predecessor british waterways , tries to have a more positive view of canal restoration and in some cases actively supports ongoing restoration projects such as the restoration projects on the manchester bolton & bury canal and the grantham canal in places , serious plans are in progress by the environment agency and the canal & river trust , see for building new canals to expand the network , link isolated sections , and create new leisure opportunities for navigating '' canal rings '' , for example the fens waterways link and the bedford and milton keynes waterway the bulk of the canal system was built in the industrial midlands and the northern england , where navigable rivers most needed extending and connecting , and heavy cargoes of manufactured goods , raw materials or coal most needed carrying however , the network linked with coastal port cities such as london , liverpool , and bristol , where cargo could be exchanged with seagoing ships for import and export ( 1998 ) hadfield 's british canals , sutton publishing ltd , in the nineteenth century , manchester 's merchants became dissatisfied with the poor service and high charges offered by the liverpool docks , and the near-monopoly of the railways they decided to bypass the liverpool monopoly on coastal trade by converting a section of the irwell into the manchester ship canal , which opened in 1894 , turning manchester into an inland port in its own right later in the 18th century , the leeds and liverpool canal was constructed , creating an east-west link , giving access to the port at liverpool allowing export of finished goods within scotland , the forth and clyde canal and the union canal connected the major cities in the industrial central belt ;
