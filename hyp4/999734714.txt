after the first instance of powered flight , a large number of jet engine designs were suggested jet propulsion of aircraft part iii g geoffrey smith flight september 25th 1941 after other jet-engines had been run , romanian inventor henri coandă claimed to have built a jet-powered aircraft in 1910 , the coandă-1910 , however to support this claim , he had to make substantial alterations to the drawings he used to support his subsequently debunked claims in fact the ducted-fan engine backfired , setting the aircraft on fire before any flights were ever made , and it lacked nearly all of the features necessary for a jet engine - including a lack of fuel injection , and any concern about hot jet efflux being directed at a highly flammable fabric surface rocket-engine research was being carried out in germany and the first aircraft to fly under rocket power was the lippisch ente , in 1928 the first flight of a jet-propelled aircraft to come to public attention was the italian caproni campini n.1 motorjet prototype that flew on august 27 , 1940 campini began development of the motorjet in 1932 , which differed from a true turbojet , in that the air was driven through by a piston engine , instead of the exhaust gas , a much more complex solution '' flight ( flightglobal.com ) , 27 october 1949 p554 the united states produced the bell xp-59a using two examples of a version of the whittle engine built by general electric , which flew on october 1 , 1942 it was the fastest conventional aircraft of the war , although there were faster aircraft propelled by unconventional means , such as the rocket-powered messerschmitt me 163 komet around this time , mid 1944 , the united kingdom 's gloster meteor was being committed to defence of the uk against the v-1 flying bomb & nbsp ; – itself a pulsejet-powered aircraft & nbsp ; and direct ancestor of the cruise missile– and then ground-attack operations over europe in the last months of the war in 1944 germany introduced into service the arado ar 234 jet reconnaissance and bomber , though chiefly used in the former role , with the heinkel he 162 spatz single-jet light fighter premiering as 1944 ended the imperial japanese navy also developed jet aircraft in 1945 , including the nakajima kikka , a modified , and slightly smaller version of the me 262 that had folding wings this highly innovative aircraft travelled far faster and higher than the propeller aircraft , was much quieter , smoother , and had stylish blended wings containing hidden jet engines the underslung engines were found to be advantageous in the event of a propellant leak , and so the 707 looked rather different from the comet : the 707 has a shape that is effectively the same as that of contemporary aircraft , with marked commonality still evident today for example with the 737 ( fuselage ) and a340 ( single deck , swept wing , four below-wing engines ) turbofan aircraft began entering service in the 1950s and 1960s , bringing far greater fuel efficiency , and this is the type of jet in widespread use today the space shuttle , while far faster than the x-43 or x-15 , was not regarded as an aircraft during ascent as it was carried ballistics by rocket thrust , rather than the air jet-powered wingsuits exist - powered by model aircraft jet engines - but of short duration and needing to be launched at height jet aircraft are usually designed using the whitcomb area rule , which says that the total area of cross-section of the aircraft at any point along the aircraft from the nose must be approximately the same as that of a sears-haack body one difference is that jet engines respond relatively slowly it can also be stated as the proportion of the mechanical energy actually used to propel the aircraft
