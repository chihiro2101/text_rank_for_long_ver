some mountain tops may be reached by walking or scrambling up their least-steep side a large-scale map is also needed , so that the route can be followed with accuracy , and escape made via recognised paths in the case of bad weather or injury some guidebooks on scrambling may rate the routes as follows : easy — generally , just off-trail hiking with minimal exposure ( if at all ) and perhaps a handhold or two difficult — almost constant handholds , fall distance may be fatal , route-finding skills needed , loose and downsloping rock in britain scrambles are usually rated using ashton 's steve ashton , scrambles in snowdonia , ( cicerone press , 1992 ) , system of either grade 1 , 2 , 3 or 3s ( s for serious ) , with the grade being based around technical difficulty and exposure this form of scrambling has climbing aids built in on the route that help make it safe thus , via ferratas allow otherwise dangerous routes to be undertaken without the risks associated with unprotected scrambling and climbing or the need for climbing equipment such as ropes such routes allow the relatively inexperienced a means of enjoying dramatic positions and accessing difficult peaks , normally the preserve of the serious mountaineer ; although , as there is a need for some equipment , a good head for heights and basic technique , the via ferrata can be seen as a distinct step up from ordinary mountain walking uk scrambles vary enormously in length ; from as little height gain as 30 metres , as with many crag rock climbs , up to the 700+ metres of vertical height gain encountered on tower ridge , a famous 3s grade scramble that ascends ben nevis via its north face ( tower ridge is also graded as a 'difficult ' rock climb - arguably britain 's longest many of these routes include a '' bad step '' , where the scrambling suddenly becomes much more serious descent from such ridges is very limited , so once committed , the scrambler must continue to the end a hiker who has scaled all possible marked tourist trails will in time typically start looking for more ambitious goals , namely those peaks that by law are only accessible via hiring a licensed mountain guide ( for a fee ) more adventurous individuals , however , or those on a tight budget ( often college/university students ) endeavour to climb those harder accessible summits without assistance , especially since very accurate descriptions of ( typically '' normal '' , i.e
