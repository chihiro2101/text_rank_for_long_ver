white mold will appear under the leaves in humid conditions and the whole plant may quickly collapse the persistence of viable pathogen within tubers , such as those that are left in the ground after the previous year 's harvest or left in cull piles is a major problem in disease management in particular , volunteer plants sprouting from infected tubers are thought to be a major source of inoculum at the start of a growing season these proteins are split into two main groups depending on whether they are produced by the water mould in the symplast ( inside plant cells ) or in the apoplast ( between plant cells ) overall the genome was found to have an extremely high repeat content ( around 74 % ) and to have an unusual gene distribution in that some areas contain many genes whereas others contain very few support for mexico comes from multiple observations including the fact that populations are genetically most diverse in mexico , late blight is observed in native tuber-bearing solanum species , populations of the pathogen are in hardy–weinberg equilibrium , the two mating types occur in a 1:1 ratio , and detailed phylogeographic and evolutionary studies until the 1970s , the a2 mating type was restricted to mexico , but now in many regions of the world both a1 and a2 isolates can be found in the same region in other parts of europe , increasing genetic diversity has been observed as a consequence of sexual reproduction this is notable since different forms of p variation in such traits also occurs in north america , however importation of new genotypes from mexico appears to be the predominant cause of genetic diversity , as opposed to sexual recombination within potato or tomato fields there are many chemical options in agriculture for the control of both damage to the foliage and infections of the tuber all of the aforementioned fungicides need to be tank mixed with a broad-spectrum fungicide such as mancozeb or chlorothalonil not just for resistance management but also because the potato plants will be attacked by other pathogens at the same time if adequate field scouting occurs and late blight is found soon after disease development , localized patches of potato plants can be killed with a desiccant ( e.g this management technique can be thought of as a field-scale hypersensitive response similar to what occurs in some plant-viral interactions whereby cells surrounding the initial point of infection are killed in order to prevent proliferation of the pathogen to increase the probability of successfully storing potatoes from a field where late blight was known to occur during the growing season , some products can be applied just prior to entering storage ( e.g breeding for resistance , particularly in potato , has had limited success in part due to difficulties in crossing cultivated potato to its wild relatives , which are the source of potential resistance genes infestans isolates , since effective plant disease resistance only results when the pathogen expresses a rxlr effector gene that matches the corresponding plant resistance ( r ) gene ; effector-r gene interactions trigger a range of plant defenses , such as the production of compounds toxic to the pathogen most early varieties are very vulnerable ; they should be planted early so that the crop matures before blight starts ( usually in july in the northern hemisphere ) some so-called resistant varieties can resist some strains of blight and not others , so their performance may vary depending on which are around new varieties such as sarpo mira and sarpo axona show great resistance to blight even in areas of heavy infestation genetic engineering may also provide options for generating resistance cultivars a resistance gene effective against most known strains of blight has been identified from a wild relative of the potato , solanum bulbocastanum , and introduced by genetic engineering into cultivated varieties of potato by using weather forecasting systems , such as blitecast , if the following conditions occur as the canopy of the crop closes , then the use of fungicides is recommended to prevent an epidemic based on these conditions and other factors , several tools have been developed to help growers manage the disease and plan fungicide applications whilst these methods show potential to allow detection of sporangia in advance of occurrence of detectable disease symptoms on plants , and would thus be useful in enhancing existing decision support systems , none have been commercially deployed to date in susceptible varieties , sometimes fungicide applications may be needed weekly the choice of fungicide can depend on the nature of local strains of p infestans became resistant to metalaxyl , but in subsequent years many populations shifted back to sensitivity in the past , copper ( ii ) sulfate solution ( called 'bluestone ' ) was used to combat potato blight another approach is to destroy the canopy around five weeks before harvest , using a contact herbicide or sulfuric acid to burn off the foliage whether a weapon based on the pathogen would be effective is questionable , due to the difficulties in delivering viable pathogen to an enemy 's fields , and the role of uncontrollable environmental factors in spreading the disease usablight a national web portal on late blight international potato center online phytophtora bibliography euroblight a potato blight network in europe usda-barc phytophthora infestans page organic alternatives for late blight control in potatoes , from attra google map of tomato potato blight daily risk across ne usa species profile – late blight ( phytophthora infestans ) , national invasive species information center , united states national agricultural library
