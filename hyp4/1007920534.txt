baking powder is made up of a base , an acid , and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use when the chemical reactions in baking powders involve both fast- and slow-acting acids , they are known as '' double-acting '' ; those that contain only one acid are '' single-acting '' by providing a second rise in the oven , double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical this is the type of baking powder most widely available to consumers today double-acting baking powders work in two phases ; once when cold , and once when hot with this acid , about two-thirds of the available gas is released within about two minutes of mixing at room temperature breads were made of grain , water , yeast , and sometimes salt combining it with an acidic ingredient like sour milk or lemon juice resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide once prepared , the white powder was much more stable than yeast baking soda and cream of tartar were relatively new ingredients for cooks : soda may have been introduced to american cooking by female irish immigrants who found work as kitchen help several recipes in the compilation cookbook practical american cookery ( 1855 ) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough at least one contributor to practical american cookery provided instructions on how to handle baking soda and cream of tartar the creation of shelf-stable chemical combinations of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar is seen as marking the true introduction of baking powder although cooks had used both sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar in recipes , they had to purchase the ingredients individually and store them separately to prevent them from spoiling or reacting prematurely nonetheless , bird 's creation of baking powder enabled cooks to take recipes for cakes such as the patriotically-named victoria sponge and make them rise higher rumford chemical works then began the manufacture of what can be considered a true baking powder generally , one teaspoon ( 5 g or 1/6 oz ) of baking powder is used to raise a mixture of one cup ( 120 & nbsp ; g or 4oz ) of flour , one cup of liquid , and one egg however , if the mixture is acidic , baking powder 's additional acids remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food however , with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate , excess alkaline substances can sometimes deprotonate the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs , resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods moisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time , and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container regardless of the expiration date , the effectiveness can be tested by placing a teaspoon of the powder into a small container of hot water early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks , to promote their new products , to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them , and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder it was also found that the lower-rising products made what were judged to be better chocolate cookies in principle , a number of kitchen acids may be combined with baking soda to simulate commercial baking powders vinegar ( dilute acetic acid ) , especially white vinegar , is also a common acidifier in baking ; for example , many heirloom chocolate cake recipes call for a tablespoon or two of vinegar where a recipe already uses buttermilk or yogurt , baking soda can be used without cream of tartar ( or with less )
