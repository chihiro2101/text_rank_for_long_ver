although the population of interest often consists of physical objects , sometimes it is necessary to sample over time , space , or some combination of these dimensions in such cases , sampling theory may treat the observed population as a sample from a larger 'superpopulation ' in the most straightforward case , such as the sampling of a batch of material from production ( acceptance sampling by lots ) , it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include any one of them in our sample as a remedy , we seek a sampling frame which has the property that we can identify every single element and include any in our sample the most straightforward type of frame is a list of elements of the population ( preferably the entire population ) with appropriate contact information these various ways of probability sampling have two things in common : every element has a known nonzero probability of being sampled and involves random selection at some point nonprobability sampling is any sampling method where some elements of the population have no chance of selection ( these are sometimes referred to as 'out of coverage'/'undercovered ' ) , or where the probability of selection ca n't be accurately determined these conditions give rise to selection bias , placing limits on how much information a sample can provide about the population information about the relationship between sample and population is limited , making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population in addition , nonresponse effects may turn any probability design into a nonprobability design if the characteristics of nonresponse are not well understood , since nonresponse effectively modifies each element 's probability of being sampled factors commonly influencing the choice between these designs include : nature and quality of the frame availability of auxiliary information about units on the frame accuracy requirements , and the need to measure accuracy whether detailed analysis of the sample is expected cost/operational concerns simple random sampling can be vulnerable to sampling error because the randomness of the selection may result in a sample that does n't reflect the makeup of the population systematic and stratified techniques attempt to overcome this problem by '' using information about the population '' to choose a more '' representative '' sample simple random sampling can not accommodate the needs of researchers in this situation , because it does not provide subsamples of the population , and other sampling strategies , such as stratified sampling , can be used instead systematic sampling ( also known as interval sampling ) relies on arranging the study population according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list a simple random selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end ( or vice versa ) , leading to an unrepresentative sample if periodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used , the sample is especially likely to be unrepresentative of the overall population , making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling ( in the two examples of systematic sampling that are given above , much of the potential sampling error is due to variation between neighbouring houses – but because this method never selects two neighbouring houses , the sample will not give us any information on that variation ) as described above , systematic sampling is an eps method , because all elements have the same probability of selection ( in the example given , one in ten ) systematic sampling can also be adapted to a non-eps approach ; for an example , see discussion of pps samples below first , dividing the population into distinct , independent strata can enable researchers to draw inferences about specific subgroups that may be lost in a more generalized random sample second , utilizing a stratified sampling method can lead to more efficient statistical estimates ( provided that strata are selected based upon relevance to the criterion in question , instead of availability of the samples ) even if a stratified sampling approach does not lead to increased statistical efficiency , such a tactic will not result in less efficiency than would simple random sampling , provided that each stratum is proportional to the group 's size in the population third , it is sometimes the case that data are more readily available for individual , pre-existing strata within a population than for the overall population ; in such cases , using a stratified sampling approach may be more convenient than aggregating data across groups ( though this may potentially be at odds with the previously noted importance of utilizing criterion-relevant strata ) finally , since each stratum is treated as an independent population , different sampling approaches can be applied to different strata , potentially enabling researchers to use the approach best suited ( or most cost-effective ) for each identified subgroup within the population first , identifying strata and implementing such an approach can increase the cost and complexity of sample selection , as well as leading to increased complexity of population estimates finally , in some cases ( such as designs with a large number of strata , or those with a specified minimum sample size per group ) , stratified sampling can potentially require a larger sample than would other methods ( although in most cases , the required sample size would be no larger than would be required for simple random sampling ) the effects of the input variables on the target are often estimated with more precision with the choice-based sample even when a smaller overall sample size is taken , compared to a random sample however , this has the drawback of variable sample size , and different portions of the population may still be over- or under-represented due to chance variation in selections this is done by treating each count within the size variable as a single sampling unit samples are then identified by selecting at even intervals among these counts within the size variable the pps approach can improve accuracy for a given sample size by concentrating sample on large elements that have the greatest impact on population estimates pps sampling is commonly used for surveys of businesses , where element size varies greatly and auxiliary information is often available & nbsp ; – for instance , a survey attempting to measure the number of guest-nights spent in hotels might use each hotel 's number of rooms as an auxiliary variable ( nearly all samples are in some sense 'clustered ' in time – although this is rarely taken into account in the analysis it also means that one does not need a sampling frame listing all elements in the target population cluster sampling ( also known as clustered sampling ) generally increases the variability of sample estimates above that of simple random sampling , depending on how the clusters differ between one another as compared to the within-cluster variation for this reason , cluster sampling requires a larger sample than srs to achieve the same level of accuracy – but cost savings from clustering might still make this a cheaper option multistage sampling can substantially reduce sampling costs , where the complete population list would need to be constructed ( before other sampling methods could be applied ) by eliminating the work involved in describing clusters that are not selected , multistage sampling can reduce the large costs associated with traditional cluster sampling then judgement is used to select the subjects or units from each segment based on a specified proportion in this case , the sampling ratio of classes is selected so that the worst case classifier error over all the possible population statistics for class prior probabilities , would be the best accidental sampling ( sometimes known as grab , convenience or opportunity sampling ) is a type of nonprobability sampling which involves the sample being drawn from that part of the population which is close to hand the researcher using such a sample can not scientifically make generalizations about the total population from this sample because it would not be representative enough several important considerations for researchers using convenience samples include : are there controls within the research design or experiment which can serve to lessen the impact of a non-random convenience sample , thereby ensuring the results will be more representative of the population ? is there good reason to believe that a particular convenience sample would or should respond or behave differently than a random sample from the same population ? is the question being asked by the research one that can adequately be answered using a convenience sample ? in social science research , snowball sampling is a similar technique , where existing study subjects are used to recruit more subjects into the sample it is difficult to make generalizations from this sample because it may not represent the total population panel sampling is the method of first selecting a group of participants through a random sampling method and then asking that group for ( potentially the same ) information several times over a period of time panel sampling can also be used to inform researchers about within-person health changes due to age or to help explain changes in continuous dependent variables such as spousal interaction formulas , tables , and power function charts are well known approaches to determine sample size good data collection involves : following the defined sampling process keeping the data in time order noting comments and other contextual events recording non-responses sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population such errors may include : over-coverage : inclusion of data from outside of the population under-coverage : sampling frame does not include elements in the population when respondents misunderstand a question , or find it difficult to answer processing error : mistakes in data coding participation bias : failure to obtain complete data from all selected individuals after sampling , a review should be held of the exact process followed in sampling , rather than that intended , in order to study any effects that any divergences might have on subsequent analysis unit nonresponse ( lack of completion of any part of the survey ) item non-response ( submission or participation in survey but failing to complete one or more components/questions of the survey ) in survey sampling , many of the individuals identified as part of the sample may be unwilling to participate , not have the time to participate ( opportunity cost ) , dillman , d.a thus for example , a simple random sample of individuals in the united kingdom might not include some in remote scottish islands who would be inordinately expensive to sample more generally , data should usually be weighted if the sample design does not give each individual an equal chance of being selected these were not expressed as modern confidence intervals but as the sample size that would be needed to achieve a particular upper bound on the sampling error with probability 1000/1001
