spelling is easier in languages with more or less consistent spelling systems such as finnish , serbian , italian and spanish , owing to the fact that , either , pronunciation in these languages has changed relatively little since the establishment of their spelling-systems , or else that non-phonemic etymological spellings have been replaced with phonemic unetymological spellings as pronunciation changes guessing the spelling of a word is more difficult after pronunciation changes significantly , thus yielding a non-phonetic etymological spelling system such as irish or french spelling reforms have been proposed for various languages over the years ; these have ranged from modest attempts to eliminate particular irregularities ( such as sr1 or initial teaching alphabet ) through more far-reaching reforms ( such as cut spelling ) to attempts to introduce a full phonemic orthography , like the shavian alphabet or its revised version , quikscript , the latest devagreek alphabet , extended english alphabet with devanagari orthography the turkish alphabet or hangul in korea for example , in english spelling , most past participles are spelled with -ed , even though its pronunciation can vary ( compare raised and lifted ) one of the difficulties in introducing a spelling reform is how to reflect different pronunciations , often linked to regions or classes many technical terms are more common in writing than in speech , so their pronunciation is almost irrelevant and it should not influence their spelling english has generally preserved the original spelling when borrowing words ; and even more importantly , english began to be widely written and printed during the middle english period : the later development of modern english included a great vowel shift and many other changes in phonology , yet the older spellings , which are no longer phonetic , have been kept for example , for '' debt '' early middle english wrote det/dette , with the b being standardized in spelling in the 16th century , after its latin etymon debitum ; similarly for quer/quere , which was respelled as choir in the 17th century , modelled on greek χορός chorus ; in both cases , the pronunciation was not changed a simple phoneme-letter representation of this language within the 26 letters of the english alphabet is impossible therefore , most spelling reform proposals include multi-letter graphemes , as does current english spelling ( for example the first two phonemes of '' sheep '' are represented by the digraphs , , and , , respectively critics have claimed that a consistent phonemically based system would be impractical : for example , phoneme distribution differs between british english and american english ; furthermore , while english received pronunciation features about 20 vowels , some non-native dialects of english have 10 or even fewer a number of proposals have been made to reform english spelling dutch has undergone a series of major spelling reforms beginning in 1804 - with varying levels of official backing and popular acceptance across dutch language areas german spelling was officially unified in 1901 and certain older spelling patterns were updated : for instance some occurrences of '' th '' were changed to '' t '' even though german spelling was already more consistent than english or french spelling , the german language countries signed an agreement on spelling reforms in 1996 ; these were planned to be gradually introduced beginning in 1998 and fully in force by 2005 some of the old spellings , which were more closely derived from the english language , still survive in proper names later reforms ( brazil , 1943 and 1971 ; portugal , 1945 and 1973 ) have aimed mainly at three goals : to eliminate the few remnants of redundant etymological spelling , to reduce the number of words marked with diacritics and hyphens , and to bring the brazilian spelling standard and the portuguese spelling standard ( used in all the portuguese speaking countries , except brazil ) closer to each other during the transition period , four spellings will coexist : the official portuguese spelling before the reform ( used in all portuguese speaking countries in africa , asia and oceania , as used in portugal by the people ) , the official brazilian spelling before the reform ( used in brazil only ) , the portuguese spelling after the reform ( used by the government and its institutions , some media and publishers in translated books ) , and the brazilian spelling after the reform ( used by the government , media and publishers in translated books ) the latter two systems are regulated by the same agreement , but differ somewhat because of differing pronunciation of the same words in portugal and brazil they mostly involved the elimination of the ( purely etymological ) greek letters that had been retained in the cyrillic script by reason of ecclesiastical tradition , and those rendered obsolete by changes in phonetics when peter i introduced his '' civil script '' , in 1708 , based on more western-looking letter shapes , spelling was simplified as well the russian orthography was simplified by eliminating four obsolete letters , and and the archaic usage of the letter ( called , or hard sign ) at the ends of words , which had originally represented a vowel with a sound similar to schwa , but had become silent by the middle ages several cyrillic alphabets with 28 to 44 letters were used in the beginning and middle of the 19th century during the effort to codify modern bulgarian until an alphabet with 32 letters , proposed by marin drinov , gained prominence in the 1870s despite many attempts , there was no universally agreed-upon spelling standard employing the latin alphabet , and the cyrillic version was considered outdated a series of reforms have been undertaken to set the standards , in order to bring the writing system to parity with spoken language to date there is no standard spelling for unvocalized hebrew , and many hebrew speakers spell according to their own instinct and custom venetian : the venetian language has never had an official orthography , because it was considered a dialect until recent times , and also now many do n't consider it as a '' distinct '' language
