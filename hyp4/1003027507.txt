it was around this time that coandă 's interest in jet propulsion began , claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in december 1907 at the sporthalle indoor sports arena in berlin as a continuation of his belgian experiments , and especially looking for a way to test wing aerofoils at higher speeds , he contacted ernest archdeacon , the co-founder of aéro-club de france , who in turn directed coandă to gustav eiffel and paul painlevé with their assistance , he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by eiffel at the front of a locomotive on the north of france railway together with henri fabre 's hydravion , the first floatplane , coandă 's aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments were placed '' in solitary state '' in an upstairs gallery , separated from the more usual types of aircraft on the main exhibition floor according to later coandă descriptions , cast aluminium components were also made by clerget to create an engine with a weight of & ndash ; equivalent to a power-to-weight ratio of , a considerable achievement at the time the powerplant was referred to in reports at the time by different terms : a turbine without propellers , turbo-propulseur , ducted fan the article included two sectional drawings of the engine '' the writer said the turbo-propulseur was '' claimed to give an enormous wind velocity '' , but the intake area seemed too small to produce the stated thrust , and that '' it also appears as if enormous power would be necessary to drive it '' , more than supplied by the clerget '' the article coandă 's new aeroplane published by a daily bucharest newspaper in 1910 , provides us with some important information : the aeroplane that received much praise in parisian newspapers was built in the workshops of clergét company in paris , a company well known for the construction of aeroplane engines '' the official exhibition report ignored the turbo-propulseur engine and instead described coandă 's novel wing design , and the unusual empennage a group of modern-day romanian investigators led by dan antoniu , having examined photographs from 1910 , concluded that the rotary compressor featured at the exhibition was a hybrid between the one described in the initial 30 may 1910 patent and that shown in a later patent application '' the complexity of the director , as it appears in the 1st patented version had major implications for the construction costs due to the multitude of elements that made it very difficult to build the new version of the propeller that the coandă 1910 machine was equipped with , was partially included in the next patent application which included the new director system but with a different rotor one of the periodicals reported an expected speed of , but no account exists of the sledge being tested '' one relevant aspect must be noted in the relation to the entire propulsion system that demonstrates that the reaction force was obtained only with air under pressure ( motofan ) like the engines of modern planes he wished to win an army-organised competition at reims in october , one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy stimulated by an eventual deal with the french government , coandă completed the project of a flying machine derived from the coandă no.1 of 1910 , as well as his latest projects protected by patents , which he modified as a result of the user 's demands '' at the third aviation salon in paris 1911 , coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two gnome rotary engines mounted back to back , connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed propeller the combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine , but coandă was unable to fund one '' during the tests , the two-bladed propeller did not provide the necessary traction either , even though there was a reserve of power in the engines '' henri mirguet writing for l'aérophile magazine in january 1912 said that the new 1911 aircraft retained the fuselage , the frame and the wing of coandă 's 1910 design , but did not keep the turbo-propulseur or '' the wooden wingloading surface including the forward longitudinal ribs '' during world war ii he revived his earlier turbo-propulseur engine when he was contracted by the german army in late 1942 to develop an air propulsion system for military ambulance snow sledges much like the one made for the russian grand duke none of the annual issues of jane 's all the world 's aircraft ever mentioned the coandă-1910 or its turbo-propulseur powerplant at the beginning of the jet age , when the potential of reactive engines was recognised , several histories of the jet engine were written '' in the editorial lead to their 1946 article on coandă 's '' augmented flow '' , flight terms it , '' scarcely a jet '' in 1953 , flights treatment of aircraft in the 50 years since the wright brothers ' flight included the coandă-1910 '' ducted fan '' and said of coandă that he '' believes that he 'took off for a few feet , then came down hurriedly and broke two teeth , quoting j.w adderley said he '' can definitely confirm that the power unit was of the ducted-fan type , similar in basic principles to the caproni-campini aircraft of the 1930s '' ( referring to the caproni campini n.1 ) in the early 1950s coandă began to claim that he had flown his 1910 aircraft himself , and that the 1910 engine was the first motorjet , using fuel injection and combustion to create its thrust coandă himself spoke on the subject , notably before the wings club at new york 's biltmore hotel on 18 january 1956 where he said '' i intended to inject fuel into the air stream which would be ignited by the exhaust gases also channelled through the same circular vent '' , implying that he never finished the powerplant for his article '' he flew in 1910 '' , rené aubrey interviewed coandă and wrote a contradictory story in the september 1956 royal air force flying review , saying that coandă had flown his unusual aircraft on 16 december 1910 , that fuel was certainly injected , and that it was '' the first jet flight in the world '' one chapter of the book describes how houart , together with a group of french dragoons , watched as coandă taxied twice around the airfield , lifted off to avoid the ruins of an old fortification wall , started flames from the engine by applying too much power , and was thrown from the aircraft the moment it hit the wall , with coandă '' not badly hurt '' in further statements , coandă said that his 1910 aircraft had movable leading edge slots , the leading edge slot was patented by handley page in 1920 retractable landing gear and a fuel supply which was held in the overhead wing to reduce fuselage profile and thus drag in 1967 , the magazine flying printed an account written by stine , which described the landing gear as retracting into the lower wing , with the fuel tank hidden in the upper wing stine wrote that coandă flew on 10 december 1910 , and described the heat from the '' two jet exhausts '' as being '' too much for me '' after the powerplant was mounted in the aircraft he wrote that '' although there were several jet-propelled aircraft in existence at an early time—the 1910 coanda jet and the 1938 caproni campini n.1—the first pure jet aircraft flight was made in germany in 1938 '' garber of the nasm interviewed coandă , who related that the december 1910 flight was no accident , that he had seated himself in the cockpit intending to test five factors : aircraft structure , the engine , the wing lift , the balance of controls , and the aerodynamics '' in this interview coandă said that he brought the aircraft back to earth under control , but the landing was '' abrupt '' and he was thrown clear of the airframe which was consumed completely by flame , the engine reduced to '' a few handfuls of white powder gibbs-smith pointed out that the pilot would have been killed by the heat if any combustion had been initiated in the engine 's air stream antoniu also wrote that gibbs-smith did not check the french patents claimed by coandă in 1910 and 1911 , describing the retractable gear , leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank , and that he did not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote '' he said coandă told various conflicting stories about his claimed 1910 flight , and that coandă produced a set of altered drawings as proof of his claims : in his article , winter wondered why coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his may 1911 patent applications if that feature had been present during his supposed flying experience five months earlier rather , winter noted that the august 1910 patent filings in french were essentially the same as the may 1911 ones in english , and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device , meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in the jet stream canovetti wrote in 1911 that the 1910 appearance of the coandă engine '' called general attention '' to designs like his aviation author bill gunston changed his mind two years after publishing a 1993 book in which he gave coandă credit for the first jet engine boyne discusses coandă briefly in one of his books , the leading edge : '' professor henri coanda , whose scientific work was impeccable , designed and built a jet aircraft in 1910 ; it , like martin 's kitten the martin kf-1 biplane , was superbly built and technically advanced—and could not fly '' in a later magazine article sidebar , boyne described more details : '' romanian inventor henri coanda attempted to fly a primitive jet aircraft in 1910 , using a four-cylinder internal combustion engine to drive a compressor at 4,000 revolutions per minute '' in 1980 and 1993 , jane 's encyclopedia of aviation included an entry on the 1910 aircraft , calling it the '' coanda turbine '' and describing it as '' the world 's first jet-propelled aircraft to fly '' '' his description of coandă 's disputed test flight agreed that fuel injection and combustion had been initiated in the rotary compressor 's vent , with the novel detail that the aircraft '' flew for about a thousand feet 300 & nbsp ; m before crashing into a wall in 1990 at the 24th symposium of the international academy of astronautics , one of the papers presented included this sentence : '' it is to henri coanda ( 1886–1972 ) , a world famous inventor and pioneer of jet flight , that space engineering owes—beside one of the first model planes provided with a rocket engine ( 1905 ) —the construction and engine experiment of the first jet aircraft , the 'coanda-1910 ' '' in 2007 in his popular book extreme aircraft , ron miller wrote that the powerplant in the coandă-1910 was one of the '' earliest attempts '' at a jet engine , but was unsuccessful—it was '' incapable of actual flight '' , unlike the engines designed by whittle and ohain the question of the coandă-1910 being the first jet aircraft does not appear to be resolved , supporting stine 's view : '' whether henri coanda built the first true jet will probably be argued interminably antoniu published henri coandă and his technical work during 1906–1918 , a 2010 book in which he said that the unfinished state of the aircraft led to coandă filing several extra patents and starting a new series of studies with the aim of making the machine airworthy it represents the aircraft on the obverse side and a portrait of coandă on the reverse , including romanian words which translate to '' first jet aircraft
