489 , 497 before the romans arrived in britain , the land now forming the county of carmarthenshire was part of the kingdom of the demetae who gave their name to the county of dyfed ; it contained one of their chief settlements , moridunum , now known as carmarthen the romans established two forts in south wales , one at caerwent to control the southeast of the country , and one at carmarthen to control the southwest the fort at carmarthen dates from around 75 ad , and there is a roman amphitheatre nearby , so this probably makes carmarthen the oldest continually occupied town in wales carmarthenshire was disputed between the normans and the welsh lords and many of the castles built around this time , first of wood and then stone , changed hands several times edward i made carmarthen the capital of this new county , establishing his courts of chancery and his exchequer there , and holding the court of great sessions in wales in the town the first industrial canal in wales was built in 1768 to convey coal from the gwendraeth valley to the coast , and the following year , the earliest tramroad bridge was on the tramroad built alongside the canal twenty-two years later this amalgamation was reversed when , under the local government ( wales ) act 1994 , the original county boundaries were reinstated the river teifi forms much of the border between carmarthenshire and ceredigion , and there are a number of towns in the teifi valley which have communities living on either side of the river and hence in different counties although llanelli is by far the largest town in the county , the county town remains carmarthen , mainly due to its central location carmarthenshire is predominantly an agricultural county , with only the southeastern area having any significant amount of industry the best agricultural land is in the broad tywi valley , especially its lower reaches with its fertile land and agricultural produce , carmarthenshire is known as the '' garden of wales '' the lowest bridge over the river is at carmarthen , and the towi estuary cuts the southwesterly part of the county , including llansteffan and laugharne , off from the more urban southeastern region on improved pastures , dairying is important and in the past , the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of england country towns in the more agricultural part of the county still hold regular markets where livestock is traded in the north of the county , in and around the teifi valley , there was a thriving woollen industry in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the village of dre-fach felindre at one time contained twenty-four mills and was known as the '' huddersfield of wales '' in 2014 , west wales was identified as the worst-performing region in the united kingdom along with the south wales valleys under the local government act 1972 , the administrative county of carmarthenshire was abolished on 1 april 1974 and the area of carmarthenshire became three districts within the new county of dyfed : carmarthen , dinefwr and llanelli the three districts united to form a unitary authority which had the same boundaries as the traditional county of carmarthenshire prior to the industrial revolution , carmarthen and wrexham were the two most populous towns in wales carmarthenshire was the most populous of the five historic counties of wales to remain majority welsh-speaking throughout the 20th century there are large stretches of golden sands and the wales coast path now provides a continuous walking route around the whole of wales the heart of wales line takes a scenic route through mid-wales and links llanelli with craven arms , from where passengers can travel on the welsh marches line to shrewsbury there are local bus services between the main centres of population , and longer distance services to cardiff and beyond
