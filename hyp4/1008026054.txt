not all leathers used in garments perform equally ; products made from full grain , top grain , corrected grain , and suede can have different levels of resistance to abrasion , as well as tearing and bursting forces duke had the suit made for the purposes of streamlining , not safety , and like the majority of the leathers used at the time , was made from horsehide ce-marked armor comes in two levels , with level 2 providing greater protection there are also motorcycle jackets that use an airbag system , which deploys in the event of an accident , inflating to protect the riders neck , torso , and lower back ( see also airbag and air bag vest ) two italian manufacturers – allegedly concerned their armour would not pass the highest standard – successfully lobbied for level 3 to be removed in both ce marked ( meets european standards ) and non-protective garments , localised protection may be provided by armour and airbag systems tough , strong , moderately flexible boots with stiff soles provide the rider protection from a number of risks ( 1 denotes rudimentary protection , while 2 indicates better protection – in tests of resistance against abrasion , cuts and being crushed separate protectors are also available , typically for the chest and back , which are worn under other items of clothing the criteria for levels 1 and 2 vary by intended use – back protection , air bag vest or body armor each have different requirements for example , body armour is classed as type a ( limited coverage ) or type b ( better coverage ) the primary goal of a motorcycle helmet is to protect the rider 's head during impact , although many helmets provide additional protection such as a face shield helmets are made in two main layers : hard and energy-absorbing full-face helmets protect the skull , plus providing protection for the lower jaw as well as the face itself several manufacturers have introduced full-face helmets with a flip-up front , combining the protection of a full-face with the ease of communication and donning or doffing that an open-face gives european standard en 13594:2015 is available for this purpose , with gloves certified to level 1 or level 2 for touring gloves , such additional features may include advanced insulating materials and waterproof fabric , although touring gloves may still lack advanced armouring features used in motorcycle racing gloves gloves intended for motorcycle racing typically incorporate pre-curved finger sections and the best available protection , obtained through additional armour incorporated within the glove furthermore , racing gloves may and often do incorporate additional wrist and other protection panels to protect the heel of the hand , back of the hand and other easily injured parts of the hand this test involves dropping the clothing material onto an abrasive belt moving at 28 km/hr and measuring the time for a hole to form this method is often criticized for not being similar to that seen on the road however dr woods used both accident damage and that seen in manikins thrown from a moving vehicle to ensure that the test replicated the real world damage as close as possible.this test has been used to show that there is a relationship between fabric thickness and time to hole for protective denim products two specialist classes are available , class b garments provide abrasion resistance however do not require impact protection to be present and class c garments are to be worn as part of an ensemble and have no abrasiom resistant qualities however have a least 1 impact protector present this class would be used for garments such as base layers the cambridge abrasion and impact cut test methods will remain present for en13594 glove and en13634 motorcycle boot testing also , the cambridge impact abrasion test is used by the motorcycle clothing assessment program ( motocap ) in australia and new zealand
