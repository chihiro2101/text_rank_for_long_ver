unlike h2g2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole unlike the rest of the site , you can put whatever you want on your user page - opinions , hobbies , news , random humor and links to your home pages on other encyclopedia sites - as long as you do n't dump a huge amount of content on your user page that is unrelated to wikipedia for example , you may want to link to your h2g2 personal space from your wikipedia user page it looks like this : use this code to add it to your user page , replacing u123 with your own u-number from h2g2 : you may also be interested in reading h2g2 's entry about wikipedia please copy your good encyclopedic content from h2g2 to wikipedia ! do n't forget to search for related wikipedia content first & mdash ; if wikipedia already has an article on the subject , just merge your own content into it : be bold ! mention on the wikipedia article 's talk page ( click '' discuss this page '' ) that you originally wrote the material for h2g2 and give your researcher number ( u-number ) , so that nobody thinks you 're committing plagiarism it may take you a little time to get used to the wikipedia approach , but do n't worry too much about it typically you can only move wikipedia articles to h2g2 in the event that you are the only person who has worked on that article the best course of action would be to save a local copy of your wikipedia article on your computer before anyone else edits it on wikipedia there 's a genuine plethora of people and locations to ask for help , either generally or more specifically about the transfer from h2g2 to wikipedia individuals who are happy to be contacted , please add yourselves : wp : th - a help desk dedicated to helping new editors the media copyright helpdesk - any queries about moving copyrighted material not answered above , they should be able to help the reference desk - a library reference desk that can answer both an actual content question or a sourcing query there is also a wikipedia : guide for everything2 noders .
