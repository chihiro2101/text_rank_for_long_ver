the turbine exit gases still contain considerable energy that is converted in the propelling nozzle to a high speed jet by replacing the propeller used on piston engines with a high speed jet of exhaust , higher aircraft speeds were attainable during the design the turbojet was found to be the optimum for cruising at twice the speed of sound despite the advantage of turbofans for lower speeds for concorde less fuel was required to produce a given thrust for a mile at mach 2.0 than a modern high-bypass turbofan such as general electric cf6 at its mach 0.86 optimum speed non-uk jet engines built in the 1930s and 1940s had to be overhauled every 10 or 20 hours due to creep failure and other types of damage to blades early german turbojets had severe limitations on the amount of running they could do due to the lack of suitable high temperature materials for the turbines garvin , '' starting something big '' , , p.5 water injection was a common method used to increase thrust , usually during takeoff , in early turbojets that were thrust-limited by their allowable turbine entry temperature on early engines , the turbine temperature limit had to be monitored , and avoided , by the pilot , typically during starting and at maximum thrust settings the intake has to supply air to the engine with an acceptably small variation in pressure ( known as distortion ) and having lost as little energy as possible on the way ( known as pressure recovery ) turbojets supply bleed air from the compressor to the aircraft for the environmental control system , anti-icing , and fuel tank pressurization , for example the engine itself needs air at various pressures and flow rates to keep it running supplying bleed air to the aircraft decreases the efficiency of the engine because it has been compressed , but then does not contribute to producing thrust aerodynamic improvements including splitting the compressor into two separately rotating parts , incorporating variable blade angles for entry guide vanes and stators , and bleeding air from the compressor enabled later turbojets to have overall pressure ratios of 15:1 or more the burning process in the combustor is significantly different from that in a piston engine in a piston engine , the burning gases are confined to a small volume , and as the fuel burns , the pressure increases further compressed air is introduced which completes the combustion process and reduces the temperature of the combustion products to a level which the turbine can accept less than 25 % of the air is typically used for combustion , as an overall lean mixture is required to keep within the turbine temperature limits in the first stage , the turbine is largely an impulse turbine ( similar to a pelton wheel ) and rotates because of the impact of the hot gas stream some engines used both at the same time liquid injection was tested on the power jets w.1 in 1941 initially using ammonia before changing to water and then water-methanol the fuel consumption is very high , typically four times that of the main engine the efficiency of a gas turbine is increased by raising the overall pressure ratio , requiring higher-temperature compressor materials , and raising the turbine entry temperature , requiring better turbine materials and/or improved vane/blade cooling when used in a turbojet application , where the output from the gas turbine is used in a propelling nozzle , raising the turbine temperature increases the jet velocity '' gas turbine theory '' cohen , rogers , saravanamuttoo , , p72-73 , fig 3.11 however , for supersonic aircraft this can be beneficial , and is part of the reason why the concorde employed turbojets
