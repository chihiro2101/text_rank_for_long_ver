though not commonly referred to as optical mice , nearly all mechanical mice tracked movement using leds and photodiodes to detect when beams of infrared light did and did n't pass through holes in a pair of incremental rotary encoder wheels ( one for left/right , another for forward/back ) , driven by a rubberized ball thus , the primary distinction of “ optical mice ” is not their use of optics , but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement , instead employing an entirely solid-state system the first two optical mice , first demonstrated by two independent inventors in december 1980 , had different basic designs : one of these , invented by steve kirsch of mit and mouse systems corporation , used an infrared led and a four-quadrant infrared sensor to detect grid lines printed with infrared absorbing ink on a special metallic surface lyon of xerox , used a 16-pixel visible-light image sensor with integrated motion detection on the same ntype ( 5µm ) mos integrated circuit chip , and tracked the motion of light dots in a dark field of a printed paper or similar mouse pad the optical mouse ultimately sold with the xerox star office computer used an inverted sensor chip packaging approach patented by lisa m modern surface-independent optical mice work by using an optoelectronic sensor ( essentially , a tiny low-resolution video camera ) to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates a simple binary-image version of digital image correlation was used in the 1980 lyon optical mouse to understand how optical flow is used in optical mice , imagine two photographs of the same object except slightly offset from each other the amount that the edges of one photograph overhang the other represents the offset between the images , and in the case of an optical computer mouse the distance it has moved optical mice mathematically process these images using cross correlation to calculate how much each successive image is offset from the previous one by describing an optical means that explicitly overcame the limitations of wheels , balls , and rollers used in contemporary computer mice , the optical mouse was anticipated tullis , where surface feature image sensing , image processing , and image correlation was realized by an integrated circuit to produce a position measurement some small trackpads work like an optical mouse this mouse uses a small infrared laser ( vcsel ) instead of an led and has significantly increased the resolution of the image taken by the mouse in august 2009 , logitech introduced mice with two lasers , to track on glass and glossy surfaces better ; they dubbed them a '' darkfield '' laser sensor a typical implementation ( by logitech ) has four power states , where the sensor is pulsed at different rates per second : 11500 : full on , for accurate response while moving , illumination appears bright mice designed for use where low latency and high responsiveness are important , such as in playing video games , may omit power-saving features and require a wired connection to improve performance because optical mice render movement based on an image which the led ( or infrared diode ) lighting , use with multicolored mouse pads may result in unreliable performance ; however , laser mice do not suffer these problems and will track on such surfaces .
