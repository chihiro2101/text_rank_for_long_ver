one estimate is a peak rate of over one hundred thousand meteors an hour , space.com the 1833 leonid meteor shower : a frightening flurry but another , done as the storm abated , estimated in excess of two hundred thousand meteors during the 9 hours of storm , leonid mac brief history of the leonid shower over the entire region of north america east of the rocky mountains he noted the shower was of short duration and was not seen in europe , and that the meteors radiated from a point in the constellation of leo and he speculated the meteors had originated from a cloud of particles in space meteor storms were anticipated , but the final calculations showed that most of the dust would be far inside of earth 's orbit & nbsp ; 6 ) it showed relative positions of the earth and tempel-tuttle and marks where earth encountered dense dust this showed that the meteoroids are mostly behind and outside the path of the comet , but paths of the earth through the cloud of particles resulting in powerful storms were very near paths of nearly no activity this '' fixed point '' slowly moves across the sky during the night due to the earth turning on its axis , the same reason the stars appear to slowly march across the sky the radiant also moves slightly from night to night against the background stars ( radiant drift ) due to the earth moving in its orbit around the sun for this reason , the best viewing time for a meteor shower is generally slightly before dawn — a compromise between the maximum number of meteors available for viewing , and the lightening sky which makes them harder to see the meteoroids spread out along the entire orbit of the comet to form a meteoroid stream , also known as a '' dust trail '' ( as opposed to a comet 's '' gas tail '' caused by the very small particles that are quickly blown away by solar radiation pressure ) shortly after whipple predicted that dust particles travelled at low speeds relative to the comet , milos plavec was the first to offer the idea of a dust trail , when he calculated how meteoroids , once freed from the comet , would drift mostly in front of or behind the comet after completing one orbit the effect is simple celestial mechanics & nbsp ; – the material drifts only a little laterally away from the comet while drifting ahead or behind the comet because some particles make a wider orbit than others these dust trails are sometimes observed in comet images taken at mid infrared wavelengths ( heat radiation ) , where dust particles from the previous return to the sun are spread along the orbit of the comet ( see figures ) the gravitational pull of the planets determines where the dust trail would pass by earth orbit , much like a gardener directing a hose to water a distant plant for example , the orbits of some repeating comets , and meteoroids leaving them , are in resonant orbits with jupiter or one of the other large planets & nbsp ; – so many revolutions of one will equal another number of revolutions of the other when the meteoroids pass by earth , some are accelerated ( making wider orbits around the sun ) , others are decelerated ( making shorter orbits ) , resulting in gaps in the dust trail in the next return ( like opening a curtain , with grains piling up at the beginning and end of the gap ) also , jupiter 's perturbation can change sections of the dust trail dramatically , especially for short period comets , when the grains approach the big planet at their furthest point along the orbit around the sun , moving most slowly the third effect is that of radiation pressure which will push less massive particles into orbits further from the sun & nbsp ; – while more massive objects ( responsible for bolides or fireballs ) will tend to be affected less by radiation pressure the meteors we see from these streams are part of annual showers , because earth encounters those streams every year at much the same rate nasa has a tool to calculate how many meteors per hour are visible from one 's observing location but new craters , perhaps even related to meteor showers are possible the martian atmosphere has less than one percent of the density of earth 's at ground level , at their upper edges , where meteoroids strike , the two are more similar isolated massive impacts have been observed at jupiter : the 1994 comet shoemaker–levy 9 which formed a brief trail as well , and successive events since then ( see list of jupiter events ) meteors or meteor showers have been discussed for most of the objects in the solar system with an atmosphere : mercury , venus , [ saturn 's moon titan , note also the huygens lander was studied for its meteoric entry and an observation campaign was attempted : an artificial meteor on titan ? , by ralph d
