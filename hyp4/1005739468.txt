epigenetics , an emerging field of genetics , has shown that lamarck may have been at least partially correct all along it seems that reversible and heritable changes can occur without a change in dna sequence ( genotype ) and that such changes may be induced spontaneously or in response to environmental factorsâ€”lamarck 's '' acquired traits '' determining which observed phenotypes are genetically inherited and which are environmentally induced remains an important and ongoing part of the study of genetics , developmental biology , and medicine critics such as the evolutionary biologist jerry coyne point out that epigenetic inheritance lasts for only a few generations , so it is not a stable basis for evolutionary change instead , lamarck '' argued that the environment created needs to which organisms responded by using some features more and others less , that this resulted in those features being accentuated or attenuated , and that this difference was then inherited by offspring in 2007 , david haig wrote that research into epigenetic processes does allow a lamarckian element in evolution but the processes do not challenge the main tenets of the modern evolutionary synthesis as modern lamarckians have claimed haig has written that there is a '' visceral attraction '' to lamarckian evolution from the public and some scientists , as it posits the world with a meaning , in which organisms can shape their own evolutionary destiny this reverse transcription process supposedly enabled characteristics or bodily changes acquired during a lifetime to be written back into the dna and passed on to subsequent generations in particular , the effect allows animals to adapt to a new stress in the environment through behavioural changes , followed by genetic change gould viewed culture as a lamarckian process whereby older generations transmitted adaptive information to offspring via the concept of learning in the history of technology , components of lamarckism have been used to link cultural development to human evolution by considering technology as extensions of human anatomy .
