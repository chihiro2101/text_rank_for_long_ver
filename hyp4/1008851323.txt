when einstein found that his general relativity equations could easily be solved in such a way as to allow the universe to be expanding at the present and contracting in the far future , he added to those equations what he called a cosmological constant ⁠— ⁠essentially a constant energy density , unaffected by any expansion or contraction ⁠— ⁠whose role was to offset the effect of gravity on the universe as a whole in such a way that the universe would remain static if the primary content of the universe is inert matter , as in the dust models popular for much of the 20th century , there is a particular fate corresponding to each geometry subsequent cosmological theorizing has been designed so as to allow for this possible acceleration , nearly always by invoking dark energy , which in its simplest form is just a positive cosmological constant in general , dark energy is a catch-all term for any hypothesized field with negative pressure , usually with a density that changes as the universe expands the current scientific consensus of most cosmologists is that the ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape , how much dark energy it contains and on the equation of state which determines how the dark energy density responds to the expansion of the universe some new modern theories assume the universe may have a significant amount of dark energy , whose repulsive force may be sufficient to cause the expansion of the universe to continue forever—even if \omega > 1 the ultimate fate of an open universe is either universal heat death , a '' big freeze '' ( not to be confused with heat death , despite seemingly similar name interpretation ⁠— ⁠see theories about the end of the universe below ) , or a '' big rip '' , where the acceleration caused by dark energy eventually becomes so strong that it completely overwhelms the effects of the gravity , electromagnetic and strong binding forces conversely , a negative cosmological constant , which would correspond to a negative energy density and positive pressure , would cause even an open universe to re-collapse to a big crunch with a positive cosmological constant , it could also occur in a closed universe the current hubble constant defines a rate of acceleration of the universe not large enough to destroy local structures like galaxies , which are held together by gravity , but large enough to increase the space between them a steady increase in the hubble constant to infinity would result in all material objects in the universe , starting with galaxies and eventually ( in a finite time ) all forms , no matter how small , disintegrating into unbound elementary particles , radiation and beyond just as the big bang started as a cosmological expansion , this theory assumes that the average density of the universe will be enough to stop its expansion and the universe will begin contracting the end result is unknown ; a simple estimation would have all the matter and space-time in the universe collapse into a dimensionless singularity back into how the universe started with the big bang , but at these scales unknown quantum effects need to be considered ( see quantum gravity ) the big bounce is a theorized scientific model related to the beginning of the known universe also , if the universe is closed , this theory would predict that once this universe collapses it will spawn another universe in an event similar to the big bang after a universal singularity is reached or a repulsive quantum force causes re-expansion this theory posits that the universe currently exists in a false vacuum and that it could become a true vacuum at any moment in order to best understand the false vacuum collapse theory , one must first understand the higgs field which permeates the universe this has the potential to fundamentally alter our universe ; in more audacious scenarios even the various physical constants could have different values , severely affecting the foundations of matter , energy , and spacetime if the theory of inflation is true , the universe went through an episode dominated by a different form of dark energy in the first moments of the big bang ; but inflation ended , indicating an equation of state far more complex than those assumed so far for present-day dark energy choosing among these rival scenarios is done by 'weighing ' the universe , for example , measuring the relative contributions of matter , radiation , dark matter , and dark energy to the critical density
