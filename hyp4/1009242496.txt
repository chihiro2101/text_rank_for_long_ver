trepanation is perhaps the oldest surgical procedure for which there is archaeological evidence , and in some areas may have been quite widespread many prehistoric and premodern patients had signs of their skull structure healing , suggesting that many of those subjected to the surgery survived the archaeological record in mesoamerica is further complicated by the practice of skull mutilation and modification carried out after the death of the subject , to fashion '' trophy skulls '' and the like of captives and enemies a study of ten low-status burials from the late classic period at monte albán concluded that the trepanation had been applied non-therapeutically , and , since multiple techniques had been used and since some people had received more than one trepanation , concluded it had been done experimentally inferring the events to represent experiments on people until they died , the study interpreted that use of trepanation as an indicator of the stressful sociopolitical climate that not long thereafter resulted in the abandonment of monte alban as the primary regional administrative center in the oaxacan highlands instead , the pre-columbian maya apparently used an abrasive technique that ground away at the back of the skull , thinning the bone and sometimes perforating it , similar to the examples from cholula however , in 2007 , han and chen from the institute of archeology , chinese academy of social sciences looked at six trepanned skulls spanning between the neolithic period through the bronze and iron ages ( around 5000–2000 years ago ) found in five different locations additionally , bone regeneration and smooth edges suggest that the subject recovered from the surgery and lived a relatively long time afterward the only known female with a trepanned skull , shown signs of bone spurs growth and retraction of the edges suggest that she also survived the surgery the hair may or may not have been shaved depending upon the site of the operation out of eight skulls with trepanations from the 6th to 8th centuries found in southwestern germany , seven skulls show clear evidence of healing and survival after trepanation , suggesting that the survival rate of the operations was high and the infection rate was low in the graveyards of pre-christian ( pagan ) magyars , archeologists found a surprisingly high frequency ( 12.5 % ) of skulls with trepanation , although more than 90 % only partial ( these served probably ritual purposes ) a small area near ( modern ) rostov-on-don , in southern russia , may have been a centre for ritual trepanning , around 6000 years ago , according to archeologists who discovered remains of eight recipients of the practice , within a small area , all with the incision in the unusual obelion position , high on the back of the head unlike trepanation , the removed piece of skull is typically replaced as soon as possible as early as 7000 years ago , one of the alternative medicine practice was boring holes in the patient 's neurocranium with the aim to cure and not to kill as many as five main methods were found for trephination in most cases , trepanation was a one-off operation , with only a small percentage of the trepanned skulls having undergone more than one surgery in those with multiple openings , the extent of bone remodelling indicate whether the opening was done at around the same time or at different times during the individual 's life the perforations were found with the growth of fine bone spurs , which indicate that trepanation had been carried out on live subjects , rather than being a ritual conducted after death however , several skulls also show the risk of the operation , with some indicating the stopping mid-operation as the trephining is incomplete the practice of trepanning also continues today due to belief in various pseudoscience medical benefits a prominent proponent of the modern view is peter halvorson , who drilled a hole in the front of his own skull to increase '' brain blood volume '' among other arguments , huges contends that children have a higher state of consciousness and since children 's skulls are not fully closed , one can return to an earlier , childlike state of consciousness by self-trepanation
