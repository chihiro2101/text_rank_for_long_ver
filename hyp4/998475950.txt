furthermore , with the exception noted above , a given dialkyl tartrate will preferentially add to the same face independent of the substitution on the alkene however , it was found that for metal catalyzed systems such as those based on vanadium , reaction rates were accelerated when the hydroxyl group was in the axial position by a factor of 34 in the absence of hydrogen bonding , steric effects direct peroxide addition to the opposite face however , perfluoric peracids are still able to hydrogen bond with protected alcohols and give normal selectivity with the hydrogen present on the peracid although the presence of an allylic alcohol does lead to increased stereoselectivity , the rates of these reactions are slower than systems lacking alcohols however , the reaction rates of substrates with a hydrogen bonding group are still faster than the equivalent protected substrates in systems that hydrogen bond , a 1,3 strain plays a larger role because the required geometry forces any allylic substituents to have severe a 1,3 interactions , but avoids a 1,2 in the vanadium case , the required geometry leads to severe a 1,2 interactions , but avoids a 1,3 , leading to formation of the epoxide anti to the directing group while hydrogen bonding substrates give the same type of selectivity in allylic and homoallylic cases , the opposite is true of vanadium catalysts although peracids and metal catalyzed expoidations show different selectivity in acyclic systems , they show relatively similar selectivity in cyclic systems for cyclic ring systems that are smaller seven or smaller or 10 or lager , similar patterns of selectivity are observed however it has been shown that for medium-sized rings ( eight and nine ) peracid oxidizers show reverse selectivity , while vanadium catalyzed reactions continue to show formation of the syn epoxide although vanadium is generally less reactive than other metal complexes , in the presence of allylic alcohols , the rate of the reaction is accelerated beyond that of molybdenum , the most reactive metal for epoxidations
