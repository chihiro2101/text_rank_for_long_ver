a single path provided by a transmission medium via either physical separation , such as by multipair cable or electrical separation , such as by frequency-division or time-division multiplexing this was based on the bandwidth required by older analog television signals since 2006 television broadcasting has switched to digital modulation ( digital television ) which uses image compression to transmit a television signal in a much smaller bandwidth , so each of these '' physical channels '' has been divided into multiple '' virtual channels '' each carrying a dtv channel for example , in wireless communications , the channel can be modelled by calculating the reflection of every object in the environment for example , in wireless communications the channel is often modelled by a random attenuation ( known as fading ) of the transmitted signal , followed by additive noise channel models may be continuous channel models in that there is no limit to how precisely their values may be defined in information theory , it is common to start with memoryless channels in which the output probability distribution only depends on the current channel input in a digital channel model , the transmitted message is modelled as a digital signal at a certain protocol layer : see also network topology in networks , as opposed to point-to-point communication , the communication media is shared between multiple nodes ( terminals ) the following channels are the principal multi-terminal channels which was first introduced in the field of information theory : a point-to-multipoint channel , also known as broadcasting medium ( not to be confused with broadcasting channel ) : in this channel , a single sender transmits multiple messages to different destination nodes the downlink of a cellular system can be considered as a point-to-multipoint channel , if only one cell is considered and inter-cell co-channel interference is neglected multiple access channel : in this channel , multiple senders transmit multiple possible different messages over a shared physical medium to one or several destination nodes interference channel : in this channel , two different senders transmit their data to different destination nodes from the above 4 basic multi-terminal channels , multiple access channel is the only one whose capacity region is known channel capacity channel access method traffic generation model
