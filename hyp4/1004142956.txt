the thc molecule , and related compounds , are usually detectable in drug tests from 3 days up to 10 days according to redwood laboratories ; long-term users can produce positive tests for two to three months after ceasing cannabis use ( see drug test ) '' hospitals see rare vomiting syndrome in heavy marijuana consumers ) thc , the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant , has an extremely low toxicity and the amount that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants poses no threat of death a review thus leading to drug toxicities by medications that the person consuming cannabis may be taking a study by the british lung foundation published in 2012 identifies cannabis smoke as a carcinogen and also finds awareness of the danger is low compared with the high awareness of the dangers of smoking tobacco particularly among younger users other observations include possible increased risk from each cigarette ; lack of research on the effect of cannabis smoke alone ; low rate of addiction compared to tobacco ; and episodic nature of cannabis use compared to steady frequent smoking of tobacco the psychoactive effects of cannabis , known as a '' high '' , are subjective and vary among persons and the method of use anxiety is the most commonly reported negative side effect of smoking marijuana cannabidiol ( cbd ) , another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts , has been shown to ameliorate the adverse effects of thc , including anxiety , that some consumers experience research have suggested that other cannabinoids like cbd may also play a significant role in its psychoactive effects oral ingestion use eliminates the need to inhale toxic combustion products created by smoking and therefore negates the risk of respiratory harm associated with cannabis smoking while several studies have shown increased risk associated with cannabis use by drivers , other studies have not found increased risk cannabis usage has been shown in some studies to have a negative effect on driving ability in cannabis and driving : a review of the literature and commentary , the united kingdom 's department for transport reviewed data on cannabis and driving , finding although impaired , '' subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired '' a 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash an extensive 2013 review of 66 studies regarding crash risk and drug use found that cannabis was associated with minor , but not statistically significant increased odds of injury or fatal accident marijuana 's cardiovascular effects are not associated with serious health problems for most young , healthy users indeed , marijuana may be a much more common cause of myocardial infarction than is generally recognized a 2008 study by the national institutes of health biomedical research centre in baltimore found that heavy , chronic smoking of marijuana ( 138 joints per week ) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke such complications demonstrate the need for studies on cannabis that have stronger controls , and investigations into alleged symptoms of cannabis use that may also be caused by tobacco showed that cannabis in australia is rarely used without other drugs while research has been undertaken on the combined effects of alcohol and cannabis on performing certain tasks , little research has been conducted on the reasons why this combination is so popular evidence from a controlled experimental study undertaken by lukas and orozco suggests that alcohol causes thc to be absorbed more rapidly into the blood plasma of the user data from the australian national survey of mental health and wellbeing found that three-quarters of recent cannabis users reported using alcohol when cannabis was not available , this suggests that the two are substitutes studies on cannabis and memory are hindered by small sample sizes , confounding drug use , and other factors in a 2001 study looking at neuropsychological performance in long-term cannabis users , researchers found '' some cognitive deficits appear detectable at least 7 days after heavy cannabis use but appear reversible and related to recent cannabis exposure rather than irreversible and related to cumulative lifetime use '' minimal long-term effects of marijuana use found the results showed long-term cannabis use was only marginally harmful on the memory and learning the observed effects on memory and learning , they said , showed long-term cannabis use caused '' selective memory defects '' , but that the impact was '' of a very small magnitude '' the feeling of increased appetite following the use of cannabis has been documented for hundreds of years , and is known colloquially as '' the munchies '' in the english-speaking world it is widely accepted that the neonatal survival of many species '' is largely dependent upon their suckling behavior , or appetite for breast milk '' and recent research has identified the endogenous cannabinoid system to be the first neural system to display complete control over milk ingestion and neonatal survival cannabis consumption in pregnancy might be associated with restrictions in growth of the fetus , miscarriage , and cognitive deficits in offspring based on animal studies , although there is limited evidence for this in humans at this time a 2012 systematic review found although it was difficult to draw firm conclusions , there was some evidence that prenatal exposure to cannabis was associated with '' deficits in language , attention , areas of cognitive performance , and delinquent behavior in adolescence ''
