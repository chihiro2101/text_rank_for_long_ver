on the other hand , the '' render unto caesar '' of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties ( secular and religious ) without conflict , but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to god , the latter takes precedence it traces the word '' loyalty '' to the 15th century , noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service , in love , or to an oath that one has made according to royce , loyalty is a virtue , indeed a primary virtue , '' the heart of all the virtues , the central duty amongst all the duties '' the short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is '' the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause '' examples of this , which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty , are loyalty by a person to his or her family , to a team that he or she is a member or fan of , or to his or her country the problem with this that duska identifies is that it then becomes unclear whether there is a strict interpersonal relationship involved , and whether ladd 's contention that loyalty is interpersonal—not suprapersonal—is an adequate description ladd considers loyalty from two perspectives : its proper object and its moral value baron ( 1984 ) , disagree amongst themselves as to the proper object of loyalty—what it is possible to be loyal to , in other words ladd , as stated , considers loyalty to be interpersonal , and that the object of loyalty is always a person in the encyclopaedia of the history of ideas , konvitz states that the objects of loyalty encompass principles , causes , ideas , ideals , religions , ideologies , nations , governments , parties , leaders , families , friends , regions , racial groups , and '' anyone or anything to which one 's heart can become attached or devoted '' baron agrees with ladd , inasmuch as loyalty is '' to certain people or to a group of people , not loyalty to an ideal or cause '' she argues in her monograph , the moral status of loyalty , that '' when we speak of causes ( or ideals ) we are more apt to say that people are committed to them or devoted to them than that they are loyal to them '' kleinig agrees with baron , noting that a person 's earliest and strongest loyalties are almost always to people , and that only later do people arrive at abstract notions like values , causes , and ideals one can , for example , be loyal to one 's friends , or one 's family , and still , without contradiction , be loyal to one 's religion , or profession they may be constructed upon the basis of unalterable facts that constitute a personal connection between the subject and the object of the loyalty , such as biological ties or place of birth ( a notion of natural allegiance propounded by socrates in his political theory ) they range from loyalties with limited scope , that require few actions of the subject , to loyalties with broad or even unlimited scopes , which require many actions , or indeed to do whatever may be necessary in support of the loyalty loyalty to a family member can , in contrast , have a very broad effect upon one 's actions , requiring considerable personal sacrifice people with one loyalty can hold that another , conflicting , loyalty is either legitimate or illegitimate at the other end of the spectrum , past the middle ground of considering some loyalties as legitimate and others not , according to cases , or plain and simple indifference to other people 's loyalties , is the positive regard of other people 's loyalties ) people may have one of a range of possible attitudes towards others who do not share their loyalties , with hate and disdain at one end , indifference in the middle , and concern and positive feeling at the other he states , that this is , however , not actually the case , arguing that whilst patriots exhibit loyalty , it is not conversely the case that all loyal persons are patriots a loyal person can , in general be relied upon , and hence people view loyalty as virtuous thus , nathanson argues , patriotic loyalty can sometimes rather be a vice than a virtue , when its consequences exceed the boundaries of what is otherwise morally desirable duska resolves the conflict by asserting that there is really only one proper object of loyalty in such instances , the community , a position that vandekerckhove counters by arguing that businesses are in need of employee loyalty john corvino , associate professor of philosophy at wayne state university takes a different tack , arguing that loyalty can sometimes be a vice , not a virtue , and that '' loyalty is only a virtue to the extent that the object of loyalty is good '' ( similar to nathanson ) misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or organisations where that loyalty is not acknowledged or respected , is betrayal , or taken advantage of social psychology provides a partial explanation for the phenomenon in the way '' the norm of social commitment directs us to honor our agreements.people usually stick to the deal even though it has changed for the worse ''
