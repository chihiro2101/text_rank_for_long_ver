franz liszt was not included , but it seems his teacher czerny arranged for him to also provide a variation , which he composed at the age of 11 about a slightly earlier period , 1815 , beethoven 's authoritative biographer , alexander wheelock thayer , writes , '' diabelli , born near salzburg in 1781 , had now been for some years one of the more prolific composers of light and pleasing music , and one of the best and most popular teachers in vienna not long afterwards , according to the story , upon learning that diabelli would pay a handsome price for a full set of variations from him , beethoven changed his mind and decided to show how much could be done with such slim materials ( in another version of the legend , beethoven was so insulted at being asked to work with material he considered beneath him that he wrote 33 variations to demonstrate his prowess at some point , beethoven certainly did accept diabelli 's proposal , but rather than contributing a single variation on the theme , he planned a large set of variations then he laid the work aside for several years – something beethoven rarely did – while he returned to the missa solemnis and the late piano sonatas in june 1822 , beethoven offered to his publisher peters '' variations on a waltz for pianoforte alone ( there are many ) '' one suggestion on what prompted beethoven to write a set of '' grand variations '' on diabelli 's theme is the influence of the archduke rudolph who , in the previous year , under beethoven 's tutelage , had composed a huge set of forty variations on a theme by beethoven there is a story that diabelli was pressing beethoven to send him his contribution to the project , whereupon beethoven asked , '' how many contributions have you got ? '' '' thirty-two '' , said diabelli 120 in june of the same year , adding the following introductory note : technically , von bülow admires in the closing four bars '' the principle of modulation chiefly developed in the master 's last creative period tovey comments : brendel 's title for this variation is to mozart ; to beethoven explaining : solomon describes the closing bars as '' the final image – of a tender , songful , profound nostalgia , a vantage point from which we can review the purposes of the entire journey
