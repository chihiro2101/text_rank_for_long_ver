utah lake is a remnant of a much larger pleistocene lake called lake bonneville , which existed from 75,000 to 8,000 years ago at its peak 30,000 years ago , lake bonneville reached an elevation of above sea level and had a surface area of , which was nearly as large as lake michigan as a result , the valley floor and lake bed are relatively flat , which causes the lake to be shallow one of the faults , the bird island fault , runs under the eastern edge of the lake and helps give rise to hot springs near lincoln beach the other major hot spring is on the northern shore and is called saratoga springs the hot springs mostly result from the development of hydraulic pressure as the ground water slopes toward the middle of the lake the lake contains a small island called bird island , about north of the lincoln beach boat ramp , near its south end image : jordan river pumps.jpg thumb left jordan river pumping station at utah lake , april 2010 after several years of drought , irrigation companies were arguing over their share of utah lake 's water from the jordan river the decree stated that the irrigation companies '' are entitled to a decree awarding to them , subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth , the right to the use of all the balance of the waters of the jordan river , for municipal , irrigation , culinary , and domestic purposes , to the extent of the capacity of their several canals , and the right to impound and store all of the waters of said river in utah lake after the decree was released , utah lake essentially became an irrigation reservoir and the jordan river 's flow was highly regulated when the water level in utah lake exceeds this level , the jordan river pumps and gates are left open the new compromise level also meant that the lake 's elevation was below jordan river 's stream bed as a result , utah county cities decided to plan how and where to build sewage treatment plants instead of dumping raw sewage into the lake doi : 10.3133/ofr20151164 if levels are high enough of either of these species and others the lake is closed to the public as a result , the fremont people left the area fort utah and battle creek 1849-50 during the spring spawning season , these tribes would meet at utah lake for the annual fish festival from escalante 's journal , he describes utah lake : '' the lake , which must be six leagues wide and fifteen leagues long , extends as far as one of these valleys round about it are these indians , who live on the abundant fish of the lake , for which reason the yutas sabuaganas call them come pescados fisheaters escalante 's record clearly distinguishes between this lake timpanogos , a body of fresh water that he saw and sized , and great salt lake , which he did not see or name , but was described to him as a river '' communicates with others much larger the party brought a small boat in which they explored utah lake and caught fish with their nets a company of forty men was sent into utah valley to stop the stealing of cattle from the salt lake valley by january 1850 , settlers of fort utah reported to officials in salt lake city that the situation was getting dangerous however , some timpanogots occasionally returned to fish on utah lake into the 1920s only three were reported in the lake ecosystem in 1969 , and one species is extinct four specimens were sent to the smithsonian institution in 1911 and the only known location for the snail was utah lake today , about 226 species of birds use the lake either as their permanent home or as a stop over on their migration it contains two units , one at goshen bay with more than of land preserved , and another unit at benjamin slough leaders of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints elders sent members in the salt lake valley to utah lake to obtain fish ; an estimated of fish were brought back at least 25 species of fish have been introduced into utah lake 's waters of the thirteen species of fish native to utah lake , one species is extinct ( the utah lake sculpin ) , one is no longer present in the lake and is under review to see if it qualifies for protection under the endangered species act ( least chub ) , one is already listed as endangered ( the june sucker ) , and one is found in relative abundance throughout utah ( the utah sucker ) the utah lake sculpin was last found in 1928 , and likely became extinct in the 1930s after severe drought lowered the lake levels , allowing much of the lake to freeze , overcrowding fish in unfrozen portions of the lake biologists have been rearing the june sucker in red butte reservoir and releasing them into utah lake to help build the population as early as 1901 , fish and wildlife representatives noted that carp were causing the trout population in the lake to collapse efforts are underway to reduce the population of carp in utah lake by employing local commercial fishermen , led by bill loy , jr to remove 5 million pounds of carp each year , as part of the june sucker recovery implementation program 's efforts to restore utah lake to a habitat in which the june sucker can survive due to its proximity to the provo-orem metropolitan area , utah lake is a fairly popular destination the ownership of lands along the shoreline of utah lake has been in dispute between the state of utah and farmers for many years the bed of utah lake , along with other natural lakes , was granted to the state upon admission to the union in 1896 however , due to the lack of an exact definition and significantly fluctuating lake levels , intermittently dry areas and wetlands , including all of provo bay , have been claimed and farmed by surrounding land owners in january 2018 , the utah department of natural resources received a project proposal as a potential solution to the lake 's nutrient pollution , invasive species , and murky water known for toxic algae , utah lake could become a housing development for half a million people the salt lake tribune available at : the project proposal involved dredging the lake bottom of all nutrient-loaded sediment , replacing invasive plant and animal species with native species , and restoring the water quality before building and developing housing on arch-shaped islands specific issues include the fact that the project would likely lead to the creation of anoxic waters due to lake stratification , the destruction of the lake 's unique hydrology and biogeochemistry , the release of toxins and nutrients , altering the lake from its natural state , and geology unsuitable for supporting inhabited islands the salt lake tribune available at : the ability of the developer to maintain the alterations to the lake after the projects completion has also been brought into question
