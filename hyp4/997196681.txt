it is something of a mystery how baikal seals came to live there in the first place they may have swum up rivers and streams or possibly lake baikal was linked to the ocean at some point through a large body of water , such as the west siberian glacial lake or west siberian plain , formed in a previous ice age they are solitary animals for the majority of the year , sometimes living kilometres away from other baikal seals in general , a higher concentration of baikal seals is found in the northern parts of the lake , because the longer winter keeps the ice frozen longer , which is preferable for pupping however , in recent years , migrations to the southern half of the lake have occurred , possibly to evade hunters in winter , when the lake is frozen over , seals maintain a few breathing holes over a given area and tend to remain nearby , not interfering with the food supplies of nearby seals in the last century , the kill quota for hunting baikal seals was raised several times , most notably after the fur industry boomed in the late 1970s and when official counts began indicating more baikal seals were present than previously known in 2004–2006 , about 2,000 seals were killed per year according to official russian statistics , but in the same period another 1,500–4,000 are thought to have died annually due to drowning in fishing gear , poaching , and the like at present , baikal seals show lower levels of contaminants than seals of europe and north america , but higher than those in the arctic the only known natural predator of adult baikal seals is the brown bear , but this is not believed to occur frequently the males tend to stay in the water , under the ice , all winter females usually give birth to one pup , but they are one of only two species of true seals with the ability to give birth to twins since the pup avoids breaking the surface with these tunnels , this activity is thought to be mainly for exercise , to keep warm until they have built up an insulating layer of blubber while moulting , they refrain from eating and enter a lethargic state , during which time they often die of overheating , males especially , from lying on the ice too long in the sun baikal seals can live to over 50 years old , exceptionally old for a seal , although the females are presumed to be fertile only until they are around 30 the remaining food sources for this seal are various other fish species , especially cottocomephorus ( about 7 % of the diet during the winter and spring ) and kessler 's sculpin ( about 0.3 % of the diet in the winter and spring ) , but it may also take some invertebrates such as epischura baikalensis , gammarids and molluscs during the day , golomyankas are typically found deeper than baikal seals have two litres more blood than any other seal of their size and can stay underwater for up to 70 minutes if they are frightened or need to escape danger according to a 2004 paper on the foraging tactics of baikal seals , during the summer nights these seals are known to have different foraging strategies during night time and during day time since it 's brighter during the day , the seals are able to see much better in order to hunt for the fish
