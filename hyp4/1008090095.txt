it turned towards the home computer market for inspiration ; nintendo specifically looked to floppy disks which were quickly becoming the standard for storage media for personal computers the disk card format presented a number of advantages over cartridges , such as increased storage capacity that allowed for larger games , additional sound channels , and the ability to save player progress coinciding with the disk system 's release , nintendo installed several '' disk writer '' kiosks in various toy and electronic stores across the country nintendo also introduced special high-score tournaments for specific disk system games , where players could submit their scores directly to nintendo via '' disk fax '' machines found in retail stores four months after the disk system was released , capcom released a famicom conversion of ghosts ' n goblins on a 128k cartridge , which as a result made consumers and developers less impressed with the disk system 's technological features retailers were critical of nintendo simply abandoning the disk writers and leaving stores with large kiosks that took up vital space , while companies began to release or move their games from the disk system to a standard cartridge ; towards the end of development , squaresoft ported final fantasy over to the famicom as a cartridge game , with its own battery backup save feature in 1986 , as video gaming had increasingly expanded from computers into the video game console market , nintendo advertised a promise to install 10,000 famicom disk writer kiosks in toy and hobby stores across japan within one year these jukebox style stations allowed users to copy from a rotating stock of the latest games to their disks and keep each one for an unlimited time to write an existing disk with a new game from the available roster was ( then about and 1/6 of the price of many new games ) players could take advantage of the dynamic rewritability of blue floppy disk versions of disk system games ( such as famicom grand prix : f1 race and golf japan course ) in order to save their high scores at their leisure at home , and then bring the disk to a retailer 's disk fax kiosk , which collated and transmitted the players ' scores via fax to nintendo it would relaunch the model of games downloadable to rewritable portable media from store kiosks , with the nintendo power service in japan which is based on rewritable flash media cartridges for super famicom and game boy from 1997â€“2007 modifications to the standard quick disk format include the '' nintendo '' moulding along the bottom of each disk card however , both of these measures were defeated by pirate game distributors ; in particular , special disks with cutouts alongside simple devices to modify standard quick disks were produced to defeat the physical hardware check , enabling rampant piracy an advertisement containing a guide for a simple modification to a quick disk to allow its use with a famicom disk system was printed in at least one magazine had a branch called disk original group , a software label that published disk system games from japanese pc software companies with enhanced jump controls and high score saving , plus a new slot machine minigame branded for the nagatanien food company the famicom disk system briefly served as an enabling technology for the creation of a new wave of home console video games and a new type of video game experience , mostly due to tripling the size of cheap game storage compared to affordable cartridge roms , and by storing gamers ' progress within their vast new adventures within its library of 200 original games , some are fds-exclusive and many were re-released one or two years later on cartridges for famicom and nes , though without the fds 's additional sound channel
