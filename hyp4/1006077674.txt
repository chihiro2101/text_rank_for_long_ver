religion and music were at the center of the dorseys ' lives , and young thomas was exposed to a variety of musical styles in his early childhood while often living hand-to-mouth , the dorseys were able to own an organ , which was rare for black families , and dorsey 's mother played during his father 's church services villa rica 's rural location allowed dorsey to hear negro spiritual , and '' moaning '' – a style of singing marked by elongated notes and embellishments widespread among southern black people – alongside the protestant hymns his father favored soon he began selling concessions there , and aspiring to join the theater band , honed his musical skills on his family 's organ and a relative 's piano , picking out melodies that he had heard and practicing long hours due to the spontaneous nature of the events dorsey worked , he became proficient at improvising , and along the way , learned to read musical notation encountering more competition for jobs and with his concentration primarily on blues , dorsey turned to composing , copyrighting his first song in 1920 , titled '' if you do n't believe i 'm leaving , you can count the days i 'm gone '' in doing so , he became one of the first musicians to copyright blues music dorsey found appeal in the freedom and potential that came with improvising within established hymns , allowing singers and musicians to infuse more emotion – particularly joy and elation – into their performances to move congregations upon hearing nix sing , dorsey was overcome , later recalling that his '' heart was inspired to become a great singer and worker in the kingdom of the lord–and impress people just as this great singer did that sunday morning '' the experience prompted him to copyright his first religious song in 1922 , '' if i do n't get there '' , a composition in the style of charles tindley , whom dorsey idolized sacred music could not sustain him financially , however , so he continued to work in blues two of his secular songs were recorded by monette moore and another by king oliver , ensuring dorsey a place as one of chicago 's top blues composers dorsey worked with rainey and her band for two years , wherein he composed and arranged her music in the blues style he was accustomed to , as well as vaudeville and jazz to please audiences ' tastes after the death of a close friend , dorsey was inspired to write his first religious song with a blues influence , '' if you see my savior , tell him that you saw me '' music performed in established black churches in chicago and throughout the u.s billed as '' tampa red and georgia tom '' and '' the famous hokum boys '' , the duo found great success together , eventually collaborating on 60 songs between 1928 and 1932 , and coining the term '' hokum '' to describe their guitar/piano combination with simple , racy lyrics unsure if gospel music could sustain him , dorsey was nonetheless pleased to discover that he made an impression at the national baptist convention in 1930 when , unknown to him , willie mae ford smith sang '' if you see my savior '' during a morning meeting when the pastor at pilgrim baptist , chicago 's second largest black church , saw the way it moved the congregation , he hired dorsey as music director , allowing him to dedicate all his time to gospel music this new style began to catch on in chicago , and dorsey 's musical partners theodore frye , magnolia lewis butts , and henry carruthers urged him to organize a convention where musicians could learn gospel blues an unintended consequence of his sales strategy helped spread gospel blues , as he worked with numerous musicians who assisted in selling his sheet music traveling to churches in and around chicago he also mentored many young musicians , including training a teenage mahalia jackson when she first arrived in chicago , although he said she did not entirely accept his instruction : '' she said i was trying to make a stereotyped singer out of her others took offense to such lively music overshadowing the minister 's spoken word , or women delivering spiritual messages through song , taking the place of the preacher who was typically male ministers who would not have considered changing their music programs just a few years before became more open to new ideas despite the objections , within months gospel blues had proven to be established in chicago 's black churches black gospel choirs were asked to perform at several white churches in chicago never considering himself a strong singer , dorsey recorded gospel music sporadically up to 1934 , and two songs in 1953 were his last , though he continued to write even with a family he remained active in music , attending multiple engagements each year ' '' when he gave interviews later in his life , he never condemned blues music or his experiences in that period handy , who was the first and most influential blues composer , '' with the notable difference that dorsey developed his tradition from within , rather than 'discovering ' it from an outsider 's vantage point '' although he was not the first to join elements of the blues to religious music , he earned the honorific '' father of gospel music '' , according to gospel singer and historian bernice johnson reagon , for his '' aggressive campaign for its use as worship songs in black protestant churches '' throughout his career , dorsey composed more than 1,000 gospel and 2,000 blues songs , an achievement mahalia jackson considered equal to irving berlin 's body of work the manager of a gospel quartet active in the 1930s stated that songs written by dorsey and other songwriters copying him spread so far in such a short time that they were called '' dorseys '' aside from his prodigious songwriting , dorsey 's influence in the gospel blues movement brought about change both for individuals in the black community and communities as a whole at the beginning of worship services , dorsey instructed choruses to march from the rear of the sanctuary to the choir-loft in a specific way , singing all the while he demanded that members attend practice regularly and that they should live their lives by the same standards promoted in their songs due to dorsey 's influence , the definition of gospel music shifted away from sacred song compositions to religious music that causes a physical release of pain and suffering , particularly in black churches the cathartic nature of gospel music became integral to the black experience in the great migration , when hundreds of thousands of black southerners moved to northern cities like detroit , washington , d.c as dorsey is remembered as the father of gospel music , other honorifics came from his choirs : sallie martin , considered the mother of gospel ( although willie mae ford smith , also a dorsey associate , has also been called this ) , mahalia jackson , the queen of gospel , and james cleveland , often named the king of gospel in 1936 , members of dorsey 's junior choir became the roberta martin singers , a successful recording group which set the standard for gospel ensembles , both for groups and individual voice type within vocal groups prominent hymnal publishers began including his compositions in the late 1930s , ensuring his music would be sung in white churches chicago held its first gospel music festival as a tribute to dorsey in 1985 ; it has taken place each year since then
