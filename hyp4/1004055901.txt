end users often use the term '' posting '' to refer to a single message or file posted to usenet the overview is a list of the most frequently used headers , and additional information such as article sizes , typically retrieved by the client software using the nntp xover command overviews make reading a newsgroup faster for both the client and server by eliminating the need to open each individual article to present them in list form this generally means that a server can run with less overhead which makes for a more efficient server , but gives less articles for users to access large news providers offer text retention up to 2480 days and binary retention of 850 days or more for news servers provided by internet service providers as part of a user 's subscription package , typical retention rates are usually only 2â€“4 days to deal with the increase of usenet traffic , many providers turn to a hybrid system , in which old articles not found on the provider 's server will request the article from another server with longer retention given the large number of articles transferred between servers and the large size of individual articles , their complete propagation to any one server farm is not guaranteed one way to measure completion is to access multiple servers and retrieve lists of articles as of 2020 , text feeds can usually be attained for free , while full binary feeds can be free or paid ( depending on how many articles each server sends to the other ) due to the large amount of data in a full binary+text usenet feed ( can be high as 30 terabytes a day ) and the high costs of transmitting that data through an ip transit provider like cogent , telia , or zayo , most usenet providers will only engage in binary peering when they are interconnected at an internet exchange like ams-ix , six , or decix there are several common ways in which the spool may be organized : one file per article is the oldest storage scheme , still in common use on smaller servers and replicated in many clients its performance capability is a direct function of the underlying operating system 's ability to create , remove and locate files within a directory , and often this scheme is insufficient to keep up with modern usenet traffic nearly all current software using this scheme stores articles using the b news 2.10 layout news servers normally connect with multiple peers , with the redundancy helping to spread loads and ensure that articles are not lost of particular interest to a transit server are : message-id - a globally unique key newsgroups - a list of one or more newsgroups where the article is intended to appear distribution - ( optional ) a supplement to newsgroups , used to restrict circulation of articles it compares the newsgroups and distribution of each newly arrived article against a set of patterns called newsfeeds , listing each remote server and the newsgroups its operator wishes to receive they are typically filed in special '' control '' newsgroups and may cause the server to automatically carry out exceptional actions a reader server typically also works as a transit server , but it may operate independently or serve as an alternative interface to an internet forum when receiving news , this type of server must perform the additional steps of filing articles into newsgroups and assigning sequential numbers within each group unlike message ids , the numbers and ordering of articles will differ on each server ; but related servers may force agreement by operating in a slave mode , re-using their siblings ' xref lines reader servers typically also maintain a news overview ( nov ) database that allows newsreaders to quickly obtain message summaries and present messages in threaded form for posting , the server will normally fill in missing path and message-id lines and check the syntax of headers intended for human readers , such as from and subject they may also be the only available means to obtain articles from remote servers that do not offer conventional feeding because hybrid servers usually use the posting function to send news , article headers are reformatted by the posting function and tracing information can be lost
