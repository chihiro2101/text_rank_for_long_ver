fogg proposes the functional triad as a classification of three '' basic ways that people view or respond to computing technologies '' : persuasive technologies can function as tools , media , or social actors â€“ or as more than one at once fogg1997b , moon2000 fogg notes that '' users seem to respond to computers as social actors when computer technologies adopt animate characteristics ( physical features , emotions , voice communication ) , play animate roles ( coach , pet , assistant , opponent ) , or follow social rules or dynamics ( greetings , apologies , turn taking ) persuasive technologies can also be categorized by whether they change attitude and behaviors through direct interaction or through a mediating role : oinas-kukkonen_harjumaa2008 do they persuade , for example , through human-computer interaction ( hci ) or computer-mediated communication ( cmc ) ? the examples already mentioned are the former , but there are many of the latter it has been demonstrated that social impact can result in greater behavior changes than the case where the user is isolated one feature that distinguishes persuasion technology from familiar forms of persuasion is that the individual being persuaded often can not respond in kind for example , when a conversational agent persuades a user using social influence strategies , the user can not also use similar strategies on the agent while persuasive technologies are found in many domains , considerable recent attention has focused on behavior change in health domains cugelman2011 maintaining behavior change long term is one of the challenges of behavior change interventions however , even though these strategies have been demonstrated to be effective , there are also existing barriers to implementation of such programs : limited time , resources , as well as patient factors such as embarrassment of disclosing their health habits to make behavior change strategies more effective , researchers also have been adapting well-known and empirically-tested behavior change theories into such practice each behavior change theory analyses behavior change in different ways and consider different factors to be more or less important the effectiveness of them vary : social cognitive theory proposed by bandura , which incorporates the well-known construct of self-efficacy , has been the most widely used method in behavior change interventions as well as the most effective in maintaining long-term behavior change even though the healthcare discipline has produced a plethora of empirical behavior change research , other scientific disciplines are also adapting such theories to induce behavior change these research has shown that these theories , already effectively proven useful in healthcare , is equally powerful in other fields to promote behavior change this result has encouraged researchers to develop persuasive technologies to promote for example , green travels , less waste , etc utilizing sensors and machine learning algorithms to monitor and predict human behavior remains a challenging problem , especially that most of the persuasive technologies require just-in-time intervention fogg notes two fundamental distinctions regarding the importance of education in engaging with ethics and technology : '' first , increased knowledge about persuasive computers allows people more opportunity to adopt such technologies to enhance their own lives , if they choose
