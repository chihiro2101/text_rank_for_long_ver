while most species have restricted distributions , others are widespread they may also consume the tentacles of their host anemone the individual species are generally highly host specific , and especially the genera heteractis and stichodactyla , and the species bubble-tip anemone are frequent anemonefish partners the activity of the anemonefish results in greater water circulation around the sea anemone , and it has been suggested that their bright coloring might lure small fish to the anemone , which then catches them studies on anemonefish have found that they alter the flow of water around sea anemone tentacles by certain behaviors and movements such as '' wedging '' and '' switching '' over time , however , there appears to be a down-regulation of metabolism and a reduced growth rate for fish associated with bleached anemones several theories are given about how they can survive the sea anemone poison : the mucus coating of the fish may be based on sugars rather than proteins this would mean that anemones fail to recognize the fish as a potential food source and do not fire their cnidocytes , or sting organelles the coevolution of certain species of anemonefish with specific anemone host species may have allowed the fish to evolve an immunity to the nematocysts and toxins of their hosts anemonefish are the best known example of fish that are able to live among the venomous sea anemone tentacles , but several others occur , including juvenile threespot dascyllus , certain cardinalfish ( such as banggai cardinalfish ) , gobius incognitus , and juvenile painted greenling although multiple males cohabit an environment with a single female , polygamy does not occur and only the adult pair exhibits reproductive behavior for example , by purposefully modifying their growth rate to remain small and submissive , the juveniles in a colony present no threat to the fitness of the adult male , thereby protecting themselves from being evicted by the dominant fish in contrast to most animal species , the female-only occasionally takes responsibility for the eggs , with males expending most of the time and effort in general , eggs develop more rapidly in a clutch when males fan properly , and fanning represents a crucial mechanism of successfully developing eggs this suggests that males can control the success of hatching an egg clutch by investing different amounts of time and energy towards the eggs genetic analysis has shown that these complexes are not monophylys , particularly the 11 species in the a the two evolutionary groups had individuals of both species detected , thus the species lacked reciprocal monophyly
