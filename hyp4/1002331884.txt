within a month or two after their marriage , ( weeks after the usa had entered the first world war ) loma had an unusual dream or vision saying that god was giving them an '' important work '' to do , preparing the way before christ 's second coming now , at that time , herbert was not at all religious and it was only in later years , that mr he soon felt god was inspiring this , opening his mind to truths that historical christian churches had not found or accepted bruce renehan , daughter of babylon , ch.15 , ( interview with john kiesz ) he would later recollect over four decades later that he believed , '' on being baptized i knew god then and there gave me his holy spirit ! '' despite his own unique teaching on baptism his own account is noteworthy for the absence of any mention of the process of laying on of hands or a special prayer in the dispensation of the holy spirit , which were considered fundamental for membership in the worldwide church of god and reason for many a new convert 's rebaptism the existence and history of this church became a significant factor in armstrong 's later beliefs '' baptism and ordination of herbert w armstrong '' while a member of the church of god ( seventh day ) , armstrong became acquainted with ministers john kiesz and israel hager who began to suspect that herbert was a little too arrogant and tended to go against church doctrine they cited armstrong 's refusal to submit to the church of god ministers to be baptized but went out to a local baptist minister instead as a point dodd , both of which had composed a book called a history of the true religion , from 33 ad to date , in which they claimed that the new testament church of the first century had secretly descended through history and eventually became the sabbath-keeping church of god ( seventh day ) eventually , this led to dugger and dodd 's ouster and when they promised to make armstrong an apostle in their new church , the church of god ( seventh day ) , he joined with them after severing ties with the church of god ( seventh day ) as the result of doctrinal disputes , he began to teach a form of british israelism , which would later make up his book united states in prophecy this , armstrong believed , indicated god was now directing him in leading a revived work into the next '' church era these broadcasts eventually became known as the world tomorrow of the future worldwide church of god it was at this time that armstrong began to make prophetic claims and among them were the claims that hitler and mussolini were the prophesied beast and false prophet of the book of revelation who would deceive the nations for a short time just before the return of jesus christ for example , a statement from a lead article in the february 1939 edition of the plain truth , about a coming world war , said this : by way of brief review of previous articles , and radio messages , notice , first , that this war will involve all nations secondly , it will center around jerusalem.and thirdly , this war will end with the second coming of christ ! from his new contacts in los angeles , armstrong began to realize the potential for reaching a much larger audience during this time , armstrong also reflected on starting a college to aid the growing church , by teaching and training young men and women the beginning of the european broadcast provides the context of a booklet published in 1956 called 1975 in prophecy ! in this book armstrong put forward a controversial vision of what the world could look like by 1975—featuring illustrations of mass burials and tidal waves destroying cities armstrong believed that god had exciting plans for mankind that would see the end of such wars—though the message went far beyond an earthly utopia several books and booklets focused on the key events that would signal the imminence of christ 's return , and taught of a specific end-time prophecy to be fulfilled , manifested in the form of european peacekeeping forces surrounding jerusalem , at which time god 's church would be taken to a place of protection , or '' place of safety '' —possibly petra in jordan in 1952 armstrong published does god heal today ? which provided the details on his doctrine on healing and his ban on doctors '' this teaching has been the cause of much controversy as individuals influenced by such teachings came to die '' in his latter years , armstrong stated that he did not know whether or not christ would return in his lifetime but did know , based on the sequence of events in the bible , that the lord 's return was approaching the church 's advisory council of elders , acting on a clause in church by-laws added in 1981 , was to select a successor after his death , yet armstrong reportedly worried about the ramifications if certain individuals were selected , such as his son garner ted or evangelist roderick meredith in april 2009 , in light of the major doctrinal shifts made , the church also changed its name to grace communion international ( gci ) to better reflect its new teachings armstrong taught that god works only through '' one man at a time '' and that he was god 's selected representative on earth armstrong taught a form of sabbatarianism , explaining that ; by creating the sabbath ( on the seventh day of creation , through resting – not working ) god '' hallowed the seventh-day of every week ( ex 20:11 ) '' and therefore made '' future time holy ! '' resting on the sabbath day is thus commanded for all mankind and should be kept holy from friday sunset to sunset on saturday armstrong , where is the true church ? 1984 , p.24 armstrong adhered to a form of british israelism which stated that the british , american and many european peoples were descended from the so-called ten lost tribes of israel , using this belief to state that biblical references to israel , jacob , etc in the course of this teaching , he also accepted the concept of an assyrian-german connection and often made identifications of other nations in '' bible prophecy '' , such as russia and china plain truth magazine , february 1985 as a result of this , armstrong believed that a unified europe ( identified by him as a '' revived roman empire '' and as the first-mentioned '' beast '' of revelation 13 ) would oppose jesus at his second coming in the battle at armageddon '' splinter groups ( previously members of the worldwide church of god ) today usually identify the current european union as the unified europe armstrong devoted much writing to 1:18 ) , armstrong concluded that many other '' sons '' ( begotten by god 's spirit ) would also be brought '' to glory '' ( heb he believed that those who die as unbelievers prior to the return of christ , exist in a state of '' unconsciousness '' ( see soul sleep ) until after the 'millennium ' at the second resurrection , during which they will be offered the choice to submit to god 's government because of his teachings identifying both the primacy of sabbath and the '' identity of modern israel '' , armstrong would come to accept that the mosaic law had not been '' done away as a result of this fundamentalist view on morality , he also taught against the use of cosmetics , long hair on men , and other matters of personal appearance armstrong and the worldwide church of god viewed revelation 2 and 3 , ( which contains seven messages to seven churches in asia minor at the time of its writing ) , to also be descriptive of seven '' church eras '' to pass , in chronological order '' laodicea '' would follow wherein lukewarmness would be the '' dominant church attitude at the end 27 he apparently modified such era teaching from an earlier version preached by a previous church of god , seventh day minister , g armstrong 's teachings and the church he created have been the subject of much criticism and controversy he made the extraordinary claim that the gospel christ brought ( of the kingdom ) had '' not been proclaimed to the world '' for about 1,900 years '' until the first week in 1953 '' when he began preaching it again on radio luxembourg armstrong was considered gifted with spiritual understanding also and that , through him , god was revealing the true meaning of parts of the bible which , till his time , had remained locked or sealed ( so could not be correctly understood ) that desire for understanding had been with armstrong since he was a small boy , '' always wanting to know 'why ? ' or 'how ? ' that obsession for understanding was to have a great influence on founding the plain truth magazine and ambassador college in later years armstrong was often criticized for having lived in extravagant wealth in comparison to a few church members armstrong stated god 's church , the now imminent bride of christ , is not going to rise to meet the returning christ in the air with painted faces and plucked and repainted eyebrows ! how cleverly , without our suspecting it , did satan influence leading ministers to derail the church in many ways ! women do not use makeup to please god today – for i can tell you on his authority it is not pleasing to him ! the use of medicine and doctors was discouraged because members were expected to place their faith in god for healing armstrong stated : here 's god 's instruction to you , today , if you are ill then god promises he will heal you ! various members suffered discomfort and even death due to reluctance to resort to medical help , yet armstrong made use of doctors and medicine later in his life this policy was changed by armstrong at a later time as the bible teaches that '' the body is the temple of god 's spirit , '' armstrong believed that it should therefore be kept in good health and presented in a manner glorifying to christ armstrong concluded that a third resurrection would take place , in which the incorrigibly wicked and those who had been converted ( baptized members of wcg ) but had 'fallen away ' ( left wcg ) and who also had not repented in the '' great tribulation '' would be resurrected and sentenced to eternal death in the 'lake of fire pagan holidays—or god 's holy days—which ? proof of the bible the incredible human potential the missing dimension in sex the seven laws of success the united states and britain in prophecy the wonderful world tomorrow what is faith ? what science ca n't discover about the human mind who or what is the prophetic beast ? why marriage – soon obsolete ?
