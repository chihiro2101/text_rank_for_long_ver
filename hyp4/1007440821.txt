john senior had named four guardians and trustees for the estate ; the young john molson 's financial affairs were overseen by his paternal uncle , thomas molson , but in september 1771 thomas turned over the duties of trustee and guardian to samuel elsdale , possibly due to poor health , as he died the following spring john went to live with a man named william robinson , and at age 12 in 1776 was consigned to the care of a mr whitehead , who was paid for his board and education until 1780 , when he turned 16 in 1783 , molson moved into the home of thomas loid just outside montreal , who had begun brewing beer the previous year molson became a partner in the brewery and took over on 5 january 1785 , eight days after he had turned twenty-one in 1786 , he returned briefly to england , and it was during that year that molson picked up the book theoretic hints on an improved practice in brewing by john richardson molson returned to quebec with more money and a new mindset she emigrated to the american colonies with her first husband , david tetchley , but ten years later left him , and reverting to her maiden name , she made her way to montreal , penniless , until taken in by molson soon molson 's beer was in such demand that according to one of his diary entries '' can not serve half my customers and they are increasing every day '' one of the major reasons for this was the wide appeal of his beer to different classes of montreal society between 1788 and 1800 , molson 's business grew quickly into one of the larger ones in lower canada molson teamed up with john jackson and john bruce who would build a ship for molson in return for putting up the money and part ownership molson was determined to make money on his ships so he dismantled accommodation and purchased in person two steamship engines from boulton & watt in birmingham , england as molson became more occupied by his multiple businesses and his seat in the assembly , his three sons began to take a much larger role in the companies john junior managed the steamships , thomas was married in england and would frequently travel sending back tips and advice to his father , and william was in charge of the brewery in 1816 , the year he took his sons formally into partnership , molson built mansion house hotel which coincided with the assembly 's acceptance of the wharf molson changed his mind not long afterwards and the bank became fully canadian-owned when the u.s while john junior and william took care of the businesses within canada , thomas was busy working in england it was in response to the economic collapse that occurred from 1817 to 1820 , that thomas convinced his partners to enter the distillery business , which was industrially a virgin land canadian theatre never resting , molson continued to build his empire by purchasing multiple steamships and creating the st lawrence steamboat company in 1826 molson decided to run against a young louis-joseph papineau but resigned quickly after discovering the amount of support papineau had from the french and the irish molson sold the house they lived in together and moved on with his life even at the age of 67 molson did not contemplate retirement ; one of his biggest projects still lay ahead since 1825 , molson had followed reports of the first railways being built in england many businesses closed in montreal but the molsons continued work as usual construction of the railroad was begun in 1835 , and was completed on thursday 21 july 1836 with great pomp and ceremony , but without the senior molson this time though , molson decided not to rebuild it in 1955 , a historian noted that of the many and myriad businesses started in 18th-century montreal , only three remained to that date
