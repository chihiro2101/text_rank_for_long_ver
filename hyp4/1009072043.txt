the boston women 's health book collective : our bodies ourselves , pages 489–491 , new york : touchstone book , 2005 typically , a diagnosis of postpartum depression is considered after signs and symptoms persist for at least two weeks a review of various fmri studies show significant differences in brain activity between mothers with postpartum depression and those without these areas are important for empathy , memory , and emotion regulation and may explain depressive symptoms as well as decreased motivation toward caregiving for fathers , several studies show that men experience the highest levels of postpartum depression between 3–6 months postpartum in addition to these abnormalities , children who grew up around postpartum depression also are susceptible to developing violent tendencies hormonal and physical changes , personal and family history of depression , and the stress of caring for a new baby all may contribute to the development of postpartum depression profound lifestyle changes that are brought about by caring for the infant are also frequently hypothesized to cause ppd mothers who have had several previous children without suffering ppd can nonetheless suffer it with their latest child despite the biological and psychosocial changes that may accompany pregnancy and the postpartum period , most women are not diagnosed with ppd while the causes of ppd are not understood , a number of factors have been suggested to increase the risk : prenatal depression or anxiety a personal or family history of depression moderate to severe premenstrual symptoms stressful life events experienced during pregnancy postpartum blues birth-related psychological trauma birth trauma ( physical ) history of sexual abuse childhood trauma previous stillbirth or miscarriage formula-feeding rather than breast-feeding cigarette smoking low self-esteem childcare or life stress low social support poor marital relationship or single marital status low socioeconomic status a lack of strong emotional support from spouse , partner , family , or friends infant temperament problems/colic unintended pregnancy breastfeeding difficulties administration of labor-inducing medication synthetic oxytocin of these risk factors a history of depression , and cigarette smoking have been shown to have additive effects however , it has been found that these diseases do not increase risk for postpartum depression contrastingly , some factors almost certainly attribute to the cause of postpartum depression , such as lack of social support women with fewer resources indicate a higher level of postpartum depression and stress than those women with more resources , such as financial studies have also shown a correlation between a mother 's race and postpartum depression these higher rates of ppd in lesbian/bisexual mothers may reflect less social support , particularly from their families of origin and additional stress due to homophobic discrimination in society further , violence against women was defined as '' any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual , or psychological harm or suffering to women '' psychological and cultural factors associated with increased incidence of postpartum depression include family history of depression , stressful life events during early puberty or pregnancy , anxiety or depression during pregnancy , and low social support nevertheless , the majority of experts continue to diagnose postpartum depression as depression with onset anytime within the first year after delivery the criteria required for the diagnosis of postpartum depression are the same as those required to make a diagnosis of non-childbirth related major depression or minor depression the criteria include at least five of the following nine symptoms , within a two-week period : feelings of sadness , emptiness , or hopelessness , nearly every day , for most of the day or the observation of a depressed mood made by others loss of interest or pleasure in activities weight loss or decreased appetite changes in sleep patterns feelings of restlessness loss of energy feelings of worthlessness or guilt loss of concentration or increased indecisiveness recurrent thoughts of death , with or without plans of suicide this type of depression can occur in up to 80 % of all mothers following delivery symptoms lasting longer than two weeks are a sign of a more serious type of depression women who experience '' baby blues '' may have a higher risk of experiencing a more serious episode of depression later on postpartum psychosis is not a formal diagnosis , but is widely used to describe a emergency psychiatry that appears to occur in about 1 in a 1000 pregnancies , in which symptoms of high mood and racing thoughts ( mania ) , depression , severe confusion , loss of inhibition , paranoia , hallucinations and delusions begin suddenly in the first two weeks after delivery ; the symptoms vary and can change quickly about half of women who experience postpartum psychosis have no risk factors ; but a prior history of mental illness , especially bipolar disorder , a history of prior episodes of postpartum psychosis , or a family history put some at a higher risk healthcare providers may take a blood sample to test if another disorder is contributing to depression during the screening support is an important aspect of prevention , as depressed mothers commonly state that their feelings of depression were brought on by '' lack of support '' and '' feeling isolated '' across different cultures , traditional rituals for postpartum care may be preventative for ppd , but are more effective when the support is welcomed by the mother further factors such as communication between the couple and relationship satisfaction have a protective effect against anxiety alone women with moderate to severe ppd would likely experience a greater benefit with a combination of psychological and medical interventions other forms of therapy , such as group therapy , home visits , counseling , and ensuring greater sleep for the mother may also have a benefit internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy ( icbt ) has shown promising results with lower negative parenting behavior scores and lower rates of anxiety , stress , and depression some evidence suggests that mothers with ppd will respond similarly to people with major depressive disorder however , a recent study has found that adding sertraline to psychotherapy does not appear to confer any additional benefit however , there is some controversy with this form of treatment because estrogen should not be given to people who are at higher risk of blood clots , which include women up to 12 weeks after delivery global among one of the most common sources of morbidity associated with childbirth , postpartum depression is a major global public health issue the highest prevalence in the us is found among women who are american indian/alaska natives or asian/pacific islanders , possess less than 12 years of education , are unmarried , smoke during pregnancy , experience over two stressful life events , or who ’ s full term infant is low-birthweight or was admitted to a newborn intensive care unit even with the variety of studies , it is difficult to find the exact rate as approximately 60 % of us women are not diagnosed and of those diagnosed approximately 50 % are not treated for ppd connections between female reproductive function and mental illness would continue to center around reproductive organs from this time all the way through to modern age , with a slowly evolving discussion around '' female madness '' with the 19th century came a new attitude about the relationship between female mental illness and pregnancy , childbirth , or menstruation it was n't until the onset of the twentieth century that the attitude of the scientific community shifted once again : the consensus amongst gynecologists and other medical experts was to turn away from the idea of diseased reproductive organs and instead towards more '' scientific theories '' that encompassed a broadening medical perspective on mental illness in the us , the patient protection and affordable care act included a section focusing on research into postpartum conditions including postpartum depression certain cases of postpartum mental health concerns received attention in the media and brought about dialogue on ways to address and understand more on postpartum mental health this was one of the first public and notable cases of postpartum psychosis , which helped create dialogue on women 's mental health after childbirth
