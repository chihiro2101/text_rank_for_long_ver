the flowers open in succession from the base of the strig and are mostly pollination , but some pollen is distributed by the wind although the bushes are winter hardy , frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring , but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year two-year-old bushes are usually planted but strong one-year-old stock can also be used in the uk , young bushes are generally planted deeper than their initial growing level to encourage new stems to grow from the base the blackcurrant requires a number of essential nutrients to be present to enable it to thrive ; nitrogen provides strong plant growth and stimulates the production of flower sprigs ; phosphorus aids growth , the setting of fruit and crop yield ; potassium promotes growth of individual shoots and increases the weight of individual fruits ; magnesium is a constituent of chlorophyll and helps increase yields through interaction with potassium ; calcium is required for cell division and enlargement and is particularly important for young plants and buds spent mushroom compost can be used but care should be taken as it often contains lime and blackcurrants prefer slightly acidic soils a balanced fertilizer can be used and a 10-10-10 granular product can be spread around the bushes at the rate of per plant this gives the plant a chance to get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit some fruit is still picked by hand for use in the fresh fruit market white pine blister rust ( cronartium ribicola ) needs two alternate hosts to complete its life cycle the fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year the effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable , since other ribes species also host the disease , some are native to north america , and others such as red currants and ribes uva-crispa were never banned currant and gooseberry leaf spot ( drepanopeziza ribis ) is another disease of blackcurrants , but it is not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance during the 20th century in europe , much hybridisation work has been carried out in order to reduce the plant 's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields they produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance , especially in the spring , ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance , disease resistance , machine harvesting , fruit quality , nutritional content and fruit flavour varieties producing green fruit , less strongly-flavoured and sweeter than typical blackcurrants , are cultivated in finland , where they are called '' greencurrants '' ( viherherukka ) breeding programmes are concentrating on yield , large fruit size , consistency of cropping and upright habit in north america , there is a need for this fruit to have resistance to white pine blister rust back-crossing these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as 'titania ' that have a higher yield , better disease resistance , are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting decoction of the leaves , bark or roots was also used as a traditional remedy during world war ii , most fruits rich in vitamin c , such as oranges , became difficult to obtain in the united kingdom since blackcurrant berries are a rich source of the vitamin , and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the uk climate , the british government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation 's crop increased significantly in britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown , mostly under contract to the juicing industry commercially , most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern europe for the juice and juice concentrate market blackcurrants were once popular in the united states as well , but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s , when blackcurrants , as a vector of cronartium ribicola , were considered a threat to the u.s for culinary use , the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a pur√©e , which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice the berries may be infused in a similar manner the leaves can be extracted to yield a yellow dye , and the fruit is a source for a blue or violet dye resulting from its rich content of anthocyanins
