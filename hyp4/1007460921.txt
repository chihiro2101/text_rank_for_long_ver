there was little alternative transport in the country besides the train , while there was a huge demand for logistics which the ns could provide while the 1950s were a good time for the company , it started to decline in the 1960s , like most other railways around the world not only did the ns suffer from the competition of the car and other modes of transport , but it also suffered from a loss of income when natural gas started to replace coal as the main fuel in power stations and homes after a gas field was found near slochteren this strategy meant , among other things , that the ns substantially increased the number of trains per hour and also introduced the intercity services in the early 1990s , the government of the netherlands started to question the subsidies given to the ns firstly , the european union passed directive 91/440 , which prescribed , among other things , the formal separation of the national railways into two separate companies , one which deals with the infrastructure , and the other which deals with the transport activities the plans entailed that the government of the netherlands would remain responsible for the rail infrastructure , while the ns would provide the passenger transport on a commercial basis the division which was responsible for the infrastructure would later be turned into ns railinfratrust to facilitate government plans for the company 's commercial operation , den besten planned to split the ns into many smaller independent divisions the plans , however , received massive opposition from the unions , which meant that the only divisions created were ns reizigers , and locomotive maintenance company nedtrain the route managers got de facto control over the operation , but they were dependent of a different organ in the company db and ns sign freight merger railway gazette international 1 august 1999 these reforms were never much of a success and left the company in an uncontrollable state meanwhile , the government had changed its opinion of the railways , it no longer considered competition on ( passenger ) transport a viable goal thus , the government started to commission railway operators to run routes on the network the ns was granted ( by the national government ) the concession to run on the main lines , whereas other companies received a number of the concessions on the secondary lines the timetable change on 10 december 2006 saw the most routes to approximate the symmetry time in clock-face schedules to the one used in most other european countries the high speed alliance ( hsa ) , a ns ( 90 % ) / klm ( 10 % ) joint venture almost went broke due to the late introduction of the trains in combination with a too high price for the concession which the company paid to the dutch government in 2013 , it was revealed that ns had been using a subsidiary in ireland , ns financial services company ( nsfsc ) , to reduce its tax liability in the netherlands ns ends irish-registered leasing activities railway gazette international 29 april 2019 in 2015 it became clear that a subsidiary of ns , abellio , had shown unfair behaviour with regard to a tendering for public transport in the province of limburg ns has also entered into a partnership with klm to operate services on the new hsl-zuid under the name intercity direct towards breda and brussels currently ns has a concession until 1 january 2015 to provide all passenger services on this network , except that on some stretches there is an overlap with lines for which other operators have a concession here the tracks are shared by three operators , as breng , ultimately part of transdev , operates there in addition to the two previously mentioned operators for the 2015â€“2025 concession , requirements include : for every train service where on average more than one-third of the passengers travel longer than 30 minutes , a train with a toilet is used , every newly ordered train has a toilet and in 2025 every train has to have a toilet ns provides three kinds of train service : a sprinter stops at all stations , and is mainly used for local traffic on some smaller lines , though , it is the only kind of service the name is derived from the 'sprinter ' ( 2900 class ) rolling stock ; however , the service was sometimes operated using older style rolling stock ( such as 'plan v/t ' : 400 , 500 , 800 and 900 class ) intercity services only stop at larger stations , and were introduced in the 1970s to provide fast train connections throughout the country there are also two former train categories , which are now used only by private operators : stoptrein : this is the original name for sprinter trains private operators do not use sprinter so all private services in the netherlands ( except of the four sneltreins of arriva , see below ) are stoptrein the ns sneltrein services are now called intercity , but they stop more often than '' real '' intercities one needs to check out with one company and check in with another on some stations the ov-chipkaart is also used on buses and trams , where hourly tickets are for sale for those who have too little credit to travel but enough cash national express group plc agreement to sell travel london national express group 21 may 2009 nedrailways acquisition reinforces long term commitment to uk transport market nedrailways 9 june 2009 : in february 2012 , abellio greater anglia commenced operating the east anglia franchise , greater anglia rail franchise announcement department for transport 20 october 2011 and in april 2015 , abellio scotrail commenced operating the scotrail franchise , also those served by other railway companies than ns reizigers ; see also station facilities part of the cost of the scheme is paid by prorail , since they are responsible for part of the delays the increasing number of servex convenience stores at railway stations and the relatively short duration of most train journeys in the netherlands have lowered the demand for on-train services
