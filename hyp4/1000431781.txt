although antenatal care is important to improve the health of both mother and baby , many women do not receive eight visits there is little evidence behind the number of antenatal visits , pregnant women receive and what care and information is given at each visit however , when this was tested , women with less visits had babies who were much more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care and stay there for longer ( though this could down to chance results ) a review looking at these interventions found that one intervention helps improve the number of women receiving antenatal care however interventions used together may reduce baby deaths in pregnancy and early life , lower numbers of low birth weight babies born and improve numbers of women receiving antenatal care a study examined the differences in early and low-weight birth deliveries between local and immigrant women and saw the difference caused by prenatal care received only small studies have been conducted looking at group care but they have found that mothers â€™ knew more about pregnancy , birth and parenting in the group setting the mothers reported liking the group care and the review found no difference between how the pregnancies developed between the group and individual setting at the initial antenatal care visit and with the aid of a special booking checklist the pregnant women become classified into either normal risk or high risk physical examinations generally consist of : collection of ( mother 's ) medical history checking ( mother 's ) blood pressure ( mother 's ) height and weight pelvic exam doppler fetal heart rate monitoring ( mother 's ) blood and urine tests discussion with caregiver in some countries , such as the uk , the symphysial fundal height ( sfh ) is measured as part of antenatal appointments from 25 weeks gestation early scans mean that multiple pregnancies can be detected at an early stage of pregnancy and also gives more accurate due dates so that less women are induced who do not need to be in a small study , mothers receiving high feedback were more likely to stop smoking and drinking alcohol however the quality of the study is low and more research is needed to say for certain which type of feedback is better the review found that routine doppler ultrasounds may have reduced preventable numbers of baby deaths but the evidence was not strong enough to recommend that they should be made routine for all pregnant women
