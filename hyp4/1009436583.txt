the banner for the fleet , blessed by the pope , reached the kingdom of naples ( then ruled by the philip ii of spain ) on 14 august 1571 the fleet moved to sicily and , leaving messina , reached ( after several stops ) the port of fiskardo in kefalonia , where news arrived of the fall of famagusta and of the torture inflicted by the turks on the venetian commander of the fortress , marco antonio bragadin spain was the largest financial contributor , though the spaniards preferred to preserve most of their galleys for spain 's own wars against the nearby sultanates of the barbary coast rather than expend its naval strength for the benefit of venice 225 fighting troops : 7,000 spain regular infantry of excellent quality , stevens , p 20 also , venetian oarsmen were mainly free citizens and able to bear arms , adding to the fighting power of their ships , whereas convicts were used to row many of the galleys in other holy league squadrons despite bad weather , the christian ships sailed south and , on 6 october , reached the port of sami , cephalonia ( then also called val d'alessandria ) , where they remained for a while the ottoman fleet had an express order from the sultan to fight , and john of austria found it necessary to attack in order to maintain the integrity of the expedition in the face of personal and political disagreements within the holy league on the morning of 7 october , after the decision to offer battle was made , the christian fleet formed up in four divisions in a north-south line : at the northern end , closest to the coast , was the left division of 53 galleys , mainly venetian , led by agostino barbarigo , with marco querini and antonio da canale in support a reserve division was stationed behind ( that is , to the west of ) the main fleet , to lend support wherever it might be needed , commanded by álvaro de bazán two galleasses , which had side-mounted cannon , were positioned in front of each main division for the purpose , according to miguel de cervantes ( who served on the galley marquesa during the battle ) , of preventing the turks from sneaking in small boats and sapping , sabotaging , or boarding the christian vessels as the christian fleet was slowly turning around point scropha , doria 's right division , at the offshore side , was delayed at the start of the battle and the right 's galleasses did not get into position don juan called a council of war and decided to offer battle the wind was at first against the christians , and it was feared that the turks would be able to make contact before a line of battle could be formed four galeasses stationed in front of the christian battle line opened fire at close quarters at the foremost turkish galleys , confusing their battle array in the crucial moment of contact around noon , first contact was made between the squadrons of barbarigo and sirocco , close to the northern shore of the gulf in the ensuing mêlée , the ships came so close to each other as to form an almost continuous platform of hand-to-hand fighting in which both leaders were killed the christian galley slaves freed from the turkish ships were supplied with arms and joined in the fighting , turning the battle in favour of the christian side meanwhile , the centres clashed with such force that ali pasha 's galley drove into the real as far as the fourth rowing bench , and hand-to-hand fighting commenced around the two flagships , between the spanish tercio infantry and the turkish janissaries when the real was nearly taken , colonna came alongside , with the bow of his galley , and mounted a counter-attack after two hours of fighting , the turks were beaten left and centre , although fighting continued for another two hours a flag taken at lepanto by the order of saint stephen , said to be the standard of the turkish commander , is still on display , in the church of the seat of the order in pisa on the christian right , the situation was different , as doria continued sailing towards the south instead of taking his assigned position ali attacked a group of some fifteen galleys around the flagship of the knights of malta , threatening to break into the christian centre and still turn the tide of the battle the christian side suffered around 7,500 deaths , the turkish side about 30,000 the engagement was a significant defeat for the ottomans , who had not lost a major naval battle since the fifteenth century refwheatcroft2004 however , the holy league failed to capitalize on the victory , and while the ottoman defeat has often been cited as the historical turning-point initiating the eventual stagnation of ottoman territorial expansion , this was by no means an immediate consequence ; even though the christian victory at lepanto confirmed the de facto division of the mediterranean , with the eastern half under firm ottoman control and the western under the habsburgs and their italian allies , halting the ottoman encroachment on italian territories , the holy league did not regain any territories that had been lost to the ottomans prior to lepanto davis synopsizes the importance of lepanto this way : '' this turkish defeat stopped ottomans ' expansion into the mediterranean , thus maintaining western dominance , and confidence grew in the west that turks , previously unstoppable , could be beaten '' the ottomans were quick to rebuild their navy by 1572 , about six months after the defeat , more than 150 galleys , 8 galleasses , and in total 250 ships had been built , including eight of the largest capital ships ever seen in the mediterranean the arrival of the spanish squadron of 55 ships evened the numbers on both sides and opened the opportunity for a decisive blow , but friction among the christian leaders and the reluctance of don juan squandered the opportunity in 1573 , the holy league fleet failed to sail altogether ; instead , don juan attacked and took tunis , only for it to be retaken by the ottomans in 1574 peace would hold between the two states until the cretan war of 1645 but after 1580 , the ottoman empire could no longer compete with the advances in european naval technology , especially the development of the galleon and line of battle tactics used in the spanish navy '' roger crowley , '' empires of the sea : the siege of malta , the battle of lepanto and the contest for the center of the world '' , publisher random house , 2008 , p spanish success in the mediterranean continued into the first half of the 17th century ottoman expansion in the 17th century shifted to long turkish war on one hand , culminating in the great turkish war of 1683–1699 , and to the war with safavid persia on the other giovanni pietro contarini ’ s history of the events , which occurred from the beginning of the war brought against the venetians by selim the ottoman , to the day of the great and victorious battle against the turks was published in 1572 , a few months after lepanto from cyprus to lepanto : history of the events , which occurred from the beginning of the war brought against the venetians by selim the ottoman , to the day of the great and victorious battle against the turks see also ewtn on battle of lepanto ( 1571 ) dominican friar juan lopez in his 1584 book on the rosary states that the feast of the rosary was offered '' in memory and in perpetual gratitude of the miraculous victory that the lord gave to his christian people that day against the turkish armada '' titian painted the battle in the background of an allegorical work showing philip ii of spain holding his infant son , don fernando , his male heir born shortly after the victory , on 4 december 1571 written in fourteeners about 1585 , its thousand lines were ultimately collected in his maiesties poeticall exercises at vacant houres ( 1591 ) , google books then published separately in 1603 after james had become king of england too sutton , university of california hypertext edition the royal connection ensured that the battle was featured in stuart aquatic pageants representing sea battles between christians and turks well into the reign it provided a series of poetic visions of the major characters in the battle , particularly the leader of the christian forces , don juan of austria , then closed with verses linking miguel de cervantes , who also fought in the battle , with the '' lean and foolish knight '' he would later immortalise in don quixote
