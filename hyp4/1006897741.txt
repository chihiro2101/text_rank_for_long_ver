in the 1708 commencement speech de nostri temporis studiorum ratione ( on the order of the scholarly disciplines of our times ) , vico said that whoever '' intends a career in public life , whether in the courts , the senate , or the pulpit '' should be taught to '' master the art of topics and to defend both sides of a controversy , be it on nature , man , or politics , in a freer and brighter style of expression , so he can learn to draw on those arguments which are most probable and have the greatest degree of verisimilitude '' ; yet , in scienza nuova , vico denounced defending both sides in controversies as false eloquence as royal professor of latin eloquence , vico prepared students for higher studies in the fields of law and of jurisprudence ; thus , his lessons were about the formal aspects of the canon of rhetoric , including the arrangement and the delivery of an argument he would call for a maieutic ( jurisprudential ) oratory art against the grain of the modern privilege of the dogmatic form of reason , in what he called the '' geometrical method '' of rené descartes and the logicians at the port-royal-des-champs abbey as he relates in his autobiography , vico returned to naples from vatolla to find '' the physics of descartes at the height of its renown among the established men of letters one of the clearest and earliest forms of this argument is available in the de italorum sapientia , where vico argues that vico 's position here and in later works is not that the cartesian method is irrelevant , but that its application can not be extended to the civic sphere his wording was '' verum et factum reciprocantur seu convertuntur '' ( '' the true and the made are convertible into each other '' ) , an idea which can be found also in occasionalism and scotism scholasticism the principle states that truth is verified through creation or invention and not , as per descartes , through observation : '' the criterion and rule of the true is to have made it '' this criterion for truth would later shape the history of civilization in vico 's opus , the scienza nuova ( the new science , 1725 ) , because he would argue that civil life—like mathematics—is wholly constructed the new science ( 1725 , scienza nuova ) is his major work and has been highly influential in the philosophy of history , and for historicists such as isaiah berlin and hayden white samuel beckett 's first published work , in the selection of critical essays on james joyce entitled our exagmination round his factification for incamination of work in progress , is '' dante in it , beckett sees a profound influence of vico 's philosophy and poetics—as well the cyclical form of the scienza nuova—on the avant-garde compositions of joyce , and especially the titular work in progress , viz in knowledge and social structure ( 1974 ) , peter hamilton identified vico as the '' sleeping partner '' of the age of enlightenment despite having been relatively unknown in his 17th-century time , and read only in his native naples , the ideas of vico are predecessors to the ideas of the intellectuals of the enlightenment moreover , recognition of vico 's intellectual influence began in the 19th century , when the french romantic historians used his works as methodological models and guides in das kapital ( 1867 ) , karl marx 's mention of vico indicates their parallel perspectives about history , the role of historical actors , and an historical method of narrative '' as a humanist and early philologist , vico represented '' a different , alternative model that has been extremely important to me in my work '' , which differed from mainstream western prejudice against the orient and the dominating '' standardization '' that came with modernity and culminated in national socialism that the interdependence of human history and culture facilitates the scholars ' task to '' take seriously vico 's great observation that men make their own history , that what they can know is what they have made , and extend it to geography vico : a study of the new science two studies in the history of ideas the rhetorical tradition : readings from classical times to the present “ democracy and the vernacular imagination in vico ’ s plebian philology , ” history of humanities 3.2 ( 2018 ) : 247–277 journal of the history of ideas 52.1 ( 1991 ) : 55-79 the new map of the world : the poetic philosophy of giambattista vico institute for vico studies entry in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the johns hopkins guide to literary theory verene , donald phillip vico 's poetic philosophy within europe 's cultural identity , emanuel l paparella leon pompa , vico 's theory of the causes of historical change , archived at the institute for cultural research portale vico - vico portal text of the new science in multiple formats essays on vico 's creative influence on james joyce 's finnegans wake samuel beckett 's essay on vico and joyce vico 's creative influence on richard james allen 's the way out at last cycle vico 's historical mythology
