choice of surf board type and size can be complex depending , amongst other things , on : boardcave australia the surfers corner skill , fitness and surfing style expected wave conditions body dimensions of the surfer ( height and weight ) traditionally board lengths have been sized according to the height of the surfer , meaning in general that longer boards would be recommended for taller surfers the bottom can also feature channels and other planing features shaped into the board in order to maximize or direct water flow across the board 's bottom surface modern surfboards often contain multiple contours on the bottom of the board , termed concaves most concaves on the modern shortboard begin about back from the nose of the board on the bottom and then carry out through the middle to the tail of the surfboard some older and more traditional surfboards along with many modern boards that take inspiration from these older boards utilize a convex rather than concave design on the bottom of the surfboard contours such as concaves ( similar to the deck of a skateboard ) or rail channels ( to add structural rigidity ) can also be shaped into the deck surfing magazine may 1979 volume 15 number 5 , page 9 in october 1980 , after seeing a twin fin surfboard with a '' trigger point '' fin simon anderson had the idea for a new , equal size , version of the existing three fin prototypes which was later dubbed the '' thruster '' this provides a standardized system that allows fins to be easily removed or replaced , utilizing set screws to hold the fins in place these systems provided surfers with the ability to alter the riding characteristics of a surfboard , by changing the size and shape of fins used another variation of fin was later designed in the time frame known as the soul fin , a sleek bendable attachment in particular windsurfers trying to improve speed records use camber fins , as the maximum performance is required on one down-wind course direction the elliptical wing shapes work very well as surfboard fins and several manufacturers make fins with this more upright stance , as it increases drive and maneuverability the additional fins ensure that even what riding down the line , two , or at least one , vertical control surface is in black water ( not unstable foam ) allows riders better turning capabilities a '' quad '' four fins , typically arranged as two pairs of thrusters in wing formation , which are quick down the line but tend to lose energy through turns tail shapes vary from square , pin , squash , swallow , diamond , and so on—each one in turn having its own family of smaller variants a pin tail causes the board to move faster in the water , whereas the hip tail is created to help balance more than speed there are several names for this piece of foam applied to the top of a surfboard to increase the grip and allow surfers to have more control and perform more high performance maneuvers larger , fuller rails contain a greater volume of foam giving the board increased buoyancy along the edge , while sharper , narrower rails have less volume , making the board easier to '' sink '' and '' lean on edge '' rockers may be described as either heavy ( steeply curved ) or relaxed ( less curved ) and may be either continuous ( a single curve between tip of nose and end of tail ) or staged ( distinct flat section in middle portion of board ) an increase in flip helps keep the board from '' pearling '' ; larger boards often require a greater flip more relaxed rockers help the board to handle better on flatter sections of water , while heavy rockers increase the board 's overall form drag but also give true lift when reaching planing speed and have a smaller turning radius having a flat , even deck rocker will increase a board 's flexibility , while a convex deck rocker creates a board that is thicker along the board 's stringer and stiffer in the water in construction , the stringer can have no special parts , or can embed a stiff , thin , vertical slat , usually of wood but sometimes of carbon fiber , running from nose to tail modern surfboards are usually made of foam using one of the following construction materials : polyurethane ( pu foam ) with polyester resin have been used in surfboards since the 1950s , and is , therefore , the oldest of the modern construction methods many hand-shaped boards are made of pu since it is a brittle material , making it easy to form by hand using sandpaper , shortening the build time both pu boards made by hand or by machines are usually more affordable compared to other foam materials some drawbacks are the toxicity of the material , that it is non-recyclable and that the pu foam is more flexible than some alternatives , making the board less stiff so that it can bend and twist more during use the surfers corner - pu or epoxy : which one is best ? '' as most of us can ’ t afford a large quiver of boards , one really solid option you can consider is looking at having your board made with pu foam and epoxy resin this will give you the trusty feel and performance of your standard board , but with the added strength of epoxy resin instead of polyester '' pu is still the most used material in surf board construction today however , they are more time consuming to shape by hand , taking for example 2 to 4 times as long to build a drawback to eps is that it is difficult to shape by hand , and eps boards are therefore typically made using machines where the shaping of the foam is near completed after the molding itself depending on construction , xps boards may however be more prone delamination due to the closed structure preventing the epoxy resin getting a good grip on the foam surfboards have traditionally been constructed using polyurethane foam and it remains a popular choice although foam boards are usually shaped by hand , the use of machines to shape them has become increasingly popular being light and strong , balsa wood was long considered a perfect material for surfboards ) various construction methods are used to hollow the inside of the surfboard and lighten the weight of the completed board the current construction methods descend from the 1930s tom blake paddleboarding method , which favors a central stringer with individually shaped transverse ribs covered with a skin and rails this skeleton is then sheathed with 5mm-thick wood strips , creating a fast hollow board with good flex properties the parallel profile system was developed from cold molded ( double diagonal ) boat building , and uses at least four layers of material laminated over a male mold into a curved blank , including enough wood for rails , which are then shaped one of the most recent modern advancements in surfboard technology is the creation of high performance boards which are wrapped in a stretchable soft skin which does not absorb water soft skin construction , such as cush or spacestick boards , adds an additional soft shell skin to the outside of a sandwich construction board since the late 1960s when gordon clark found the optimum formulation of urethane foam , many of the surfboards in common use have been of the shortboard variety between in length with a pointed nose and a rounded or squarish tail , typically with three '' skegs '' ( fins ) but sometimes with two or as many as five surfers generally find a shortboard quick to maneuver compared with other types of surfboards , but because of a lack of flotation due to the smaller size , the shortboard is harder to catch waves with , often requiring steeper , larger and more powerful waves and very late takeoffs , where the surfer catches the wave at the critical moment before it breaks this , combined with deep double concave channels creates a distinctive board the manufacturer has shown that these channels create versatile and controlled characteristics using the venturi effect which guides the water off of the surface of the board through a narrowed passage modern hybrid boards are usually in length with a more rounded profile and tail shape hybrid boards are usually used in smaller waves and can have any fin set up they can be easier to ride for beginning surfers and generally perform well in surfing conditions where the more traditional long and short boards might not note , any type of board ( such as shortboard or mini-longboard ) can have a fish tail , and these are commonly referred to as a '' fish '' , but they lack the other properties of a traditional , or '' retro '' fish as described here big wave boards of length are considered guns in the 1920s boards made of plywood or planking called hollowboards came into use today 's longboards are typically long , although some ride boards up to in length a longboard with a single fin allows the board to pivot turn in order to remain in the curl of the wave sometimes referred as a '' single-fin with training wheels '' , the 2+1 's fins actually takes the features of the classic longboard and the tri-fin named after malibu , california , this racy longboard shape is a little narrower than most , with slightly pulled in nose and tail sections for extra maneuverability on malibu 's famous right hand point breaks
