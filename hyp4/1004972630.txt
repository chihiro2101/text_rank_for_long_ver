being frequency dependent , the reverberation time measured in narrow bands will differ depending on the frequency band being measured for precision , it is important to know what ranges of frequencies are being described by a reverberation time measurement using a portable wind chest and organ pipes as a sound source , a stopwatch and his ears , he measured the time from interruption of the source to inaudibility ( a difference of roughly 60 & nbsp ; db ) reverberation effects are often used in studios to add depth to sounds basic factors that affect a room 's reverberation time include the size and shape of the enclosure as well as the materials used in the construction of the room historically , reverberation time could only be measured using a level recorder ( a plotting device which graphs the noise level against time on a ribbon of moving paper ) several methods exist for measuring reverb time an impulse can be measured by creating a sufficiently loud noise ( which must have a defined cut-off point ) a two-port measurement system can also be used to measure noise introduced into a space and compare it to what is subsequently measured in the space there may or may not be any statement of the frequency band used in the measurement several systems have been developed to produce or to simulate reverberation although this is still a common technique , it requires a dedicated soundproofed room , and varying the reverb time is difficult a plate reverb system uses an electromechanical transducer , similar to the driver in a loudspeaker , to create vibrations in a large plate of sheet metal a spring reverb system uses a transducer at one end of a spring and a pickup at the other , similar to those used in plate reverbs , to create and capture vibrations within a metal spring spring reverberators were once widely used in semi-professional recording and are frequently incorporated into guitar amplifiers due to their modest cost and small size digital reverberators use various signal processing algorithms in order to create the reverb effect since reverberation is essentially caused by a very large number of echoes , simple reverberation algorithms use several feedback delay circuits to create a large , decaying series of echoes more advanced digital reverb generators can simulate the time and frequency domain response of a specific room ( using room dimensions , absorption , and other properties ) it uses the mathematical convolution operation , a pre-recorded audio sample of the impulse response of the space being modeled , and the sound to be echoed , to produce the effect
