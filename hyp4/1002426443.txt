while one could argue that campanella was simply thinking of the conquest of the new world , it seems that this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written shortly before the city of the sun , the monarchy in spain , in which campanella exposes his vision of a unified , peaceful world governed by a theocracy monarchy everyone must be acquainted with all lines of work , and then each person practices the one for which he shows the greatest aptitude the citizens possess nothing ; instead , everything is held in common , from food to houses , from the acquisition of knowledge to the exercise of activities , from honors to amusements , from women to children they live “ like philosophers in common ” because they are aware of the negative impact , not only on the social but also on the moral level , of an unequal distribution of goods starting with the wall that holds up the columns of the temple and gradually descending in large circles , following the order of the planets from mercury to saturn , we encounter illustrations of the heavens and the stars , of mathematical figures , of every country on earth and of all the marvels and secrets of the mineral , vegetable and animal worlds , until we arrive at mankind : on the internal wall of the sixth circle the mechanical arts and their inventors are represented campanella was greatly interested in all ingenious discoveries , and in the city of the sun he provides many examples of curious inventions , such as vessels able to navigate without wind and without sails , and stirrups that make it possible to guide a horse using only one 's feet , leaving one 's hands free knowledge is not enclosed in books kept in separate places such as libraries but is openly on show to everyone 's eyes in addition to the common ownership and the painted walls , another characteristic feature of the city of the sun , one that is more difficult and disconcerting and that campanella himself describes as “ hard and arduous ” , is the community of wives the act of generation entails a large responsibility of the part of the parents ; and if it is exercised in an incorrect manner , it can give rise to a long chain of suffering the task of the twenty-four priests , who live in cells located in the highest part of the temple , is to observe the stars and , using astronomical instruments , to take account of all their movements it is their job to indicate the times most favorable for generation and for agricultural labors , acting in this way as intermediaries between god and human beings
