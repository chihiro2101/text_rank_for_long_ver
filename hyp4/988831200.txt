for a symmetrical polyhedron , a shell may be made up of one or more cell types although these rules refer specifically to the icosahedron 's geometry , they have been adapted to work for arbitrary polyhedra they ensure , among other things , that the rotational symmetry of the original polyhedron is preserved , and that each stellation is different in outward appearance we can also identify some other categories : a partial stellation is one where not all elements of a given dimensionality are extended a sub-symmetric stellation is one where not all elements are extended symmetrically miller proposed a set of rules for defining which stellation forms should be considered '' properly significant and distinct '' for example many have hollow centres where the original faces and edges of the core polyhedron are entirely missing : there is nothing left to be stellated on the other hand , kepler 's method also yields stellations which are forbidden by miller 's rules since their cells are edge- or vertex-connected , even though their faces are single polygons they are based on combining parts within the stellation diagram in certain ways , and do n't take into account the topology of the resulting faces as such there are some quite reasonable stellations of the icosahedron that are not part of their list – one was identified by james bridge in 1974 , while some '' miller stellations '' are questionable as to whether they should be regarded as stellations at all – one of the icosahedral set comprises several quite disconnected cells floating symmetrically in space most progress has been made based on the notion that stellation is the reciprocal or dual process to facetting , whereby parts are removed from a polyhedron without creating any new vertices some polyhedronists take the view that stellation is a two-way process , such that any two polyhedra sharing the same face planes are stellations of each other the stellation process can be applied to higher dimensional polytopes as well for example , in 4-space , the great grand stellated 120-cell is the final stellation of the regular 4-polytope 120-cell this allows a systematic use of words such as 'stellated ' , 'great , and 'grand ' in devising names for the resulting figures
