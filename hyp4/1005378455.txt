education and early life behavioural ecologists and evolutionary biologists still recognise the contribution this book offered the field of behavioural science studies by behaviour , he means the total movements made by the intact animal ; innate behaviour is that which is not changed by the learning process british journal of the philosophy of science , 6 , 321–331 ( 1956 ) in particular , he was interested in explaining 'spontaneous ' behaviours : those that occurred in their complete form the first time they were performed and that seemed resistant to the effects of learning tinbergen stated that their revival of the '' watching and wondering '' approach to studying behaviour could indeed contribute to the relief of human suffering physiology or medicine : 1971–1980 19711980 , 113 ( 1992 ) the studies performed by the trio on fish , insects and birds laid the foundation for further studies on the importance of specific experiences during critical periods of normal development , as well as the effects of abnormal psychosocial situations in mammals the nobel prize for the introduction of ethology , or animal behaviour , as a new research field : possible implications for child development and behaviour : nobel prizes of importance to paediatrics the work of tinbergen during this time was also regarded as having possible implications for further research in child development and behaviour the nobel prize for the introduction of ethology , or animal behaviour , as a new research field : possible implications for child development and behaviour : nobel prizes of importance to paediatrics acta paediatrica 96 , 1105–1108 ( 2007 ) he also caused some intrigue by dedicating a large part of his acceptance speech to fm alexander , originator of the alexander technique , a method which investigates postural reflexes and responses in human beings tinbergen described four questions he believed should be asked of any animal behaviour , diagram on the four areas of biology further diagrams on the four areas of biology by gerhard medicus ( documents no 6 , 7 and 8 of block 1 in english ) ( in english : biological questions in animal psychology ) which were : causality ( mechanism ) : what are the stimuli that elicit the response , and how has it been modified by recent learning ? how do behaviour and psyche '' function '' on the molecular , physiological , neuro-ethological , cognitive and social level , and what do the relations between the levels look like ? ( compare : nicolai hartmann : '' the laws about the levels of complexity '' ) development ( ontogeny ) : how does the behaviour change with age , and what early experiences are necessary for the behaviour to be shown ? which developmental steps ( the ontogenesis follows an '' inner plan '' ) and which environmental factors play when / which role ? ( compare : recapitulation theory ) function ( adaptation ) : how does the behaviour impact on the animal 's chances of survival and reproduction ? evolution ( phylogeny ) : how does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related species , and how might it have arisen through the process of phylogeny ? why did structural associations ( behaviour can be seen as a '' time space structure '' ) evolve in this manner and not otherwise ? in ethology and sociobiology , causation and ontogeny are summarised as the '' proximate mechanisms '' , while adaptation and phylogeny are the '' ultimate mechanisms '' among the modern works calling attention to tinbergen 's classic work is deirdre barrett 's 2010 book , supernormal stimuli however , his interpretations of autistic behaviour , and the holding therapy that he recommended , lacked scientific support and the therapy has been described as controversial and potentially abusive , particularly by individuals with autism themselves 1953 : social behaviour in animals : with special reference to vertebrates
