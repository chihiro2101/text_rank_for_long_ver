after borrowing money in order to start warp graphics , the pinis started publishing with elfquest 2 ( published magazine size with glossy full-color covers and a character portrait print on the back cover by wendy ; a format that continued throughout the series ' entire run ) this series was one of the early successes that marked the establishment of a phase in underground comics in which a new genre of alternative independent comic books emerged that were closer in content to the comics mainstream the original series—generally referred to as '' the original quest '' or '' oq '' —ran for 20 '' magazine-size '' issues ( spanning about seven to eight years in terms of the main storyline ) , released three times a year two more series were published in a reduced '' comic book size '' format , but still in black and white : siege at blue mountain ( 8 issues ) and kings of the broken wheel ( 9 issues ) , later collected and published in color as part of a second edition of the graphic novels as books 5–8 the stories take place three years after the original quest the ( initially ) color titles new blood , hidden years , and shards for the most part carried the main storyline forward from the prehistoric to the medieval period of the world of two moons , now named abode , occasionally featuring non-canonical stories the first ten issues of hidden years were collected in two color volumes , hidden years and rogue 's challenge ( book 9 in the continuity of the second edition of graphic novels ) selected stories from the first ten issues of new blood were collected as new blood and bedtime stories towards the end of their runs , in the mid-1990s , most of these titles reverted to black and white in north america , though some were published in color in europe in large part as a response to the shrinking direct market in the mid-1990s , continuing storylines were collapsed together into a single 64-page anthology series introduced by the one shot metamorphosis the series has also served as the basis for three novelizations ( journey to sorrow 's end , the quest begins , and captives of blue mountain ) and five '' blood of ten chiefs '' short story anthologies ( some of which served as the basis of scripts in blood of ten chiefs comic book series ) meanwhile , september 2003 saw the publication of elfquest : wolfrider volume 1 , beginning a series of bimonthly manga-sized black-and-white reprint collections which arrange the story into chronological order for the first time , beginning around 600 years before the events in the original series unfortunately , some sections of the original artwork are not included , for example in '' elfquest : the grand quest volume 11 '' a standalone story involving tyleet and her adopted human son little patch is not in the volume though later in volume 13 tyleet mentions little patch constantly while discussing the dream she had while encased for 10,000 years by the preservers they intended to make the entire series available online over the course of 2008 , but the issues proved too numerous to upload within the deadline the '' final quest '' series began publication by dark horse comics ; the first issue was released on january 22 , 2014 the final issue , issue 24 , was released on february 28 , 2018 , exactly 40 years after issue 1 of the original quest was first released the world in which the series takes place , eventually called abode by its human inhabitants , but originally referred to as the world of two moons , superficially resembles earth , with geography that is marginally similar as the story moves forward however , and abode 's history develops , it becomes apparent that its human culture and technology is distinguished by the twenty thousand years of influence by the elves , who have left an indelible mark on human society , though their existence is unacknowledged and unofficially suppressed by the world government of abode 's future after journeying to many different worlds , one of these vessels came to abode ( known to its inhabitants as the world of two moons ) , where human civilization had reached a level that was almost identical to europe 's medieval period on earth observing the humans , the high ones saw the humans ' artwork and literature depicted angels , deity , spirits and other ethereal beings which suggested to the high ones that others of their kind had previously visited that world in order to facilitate contact with the humans , before landing on the world , the high ones deliberately formed themselves like elves and reshaped their egg-vessel to resemble a beautiful floating castle that matched the native architectural idiom , so that they could stay long enough to seek out more information about the previous visitors the palace itself consists of two main parts : the magical material of which it is made , and two magic scrolls that contain all the history of the high ones the high ones ' evolved-simian servants also fled , mainly into networks of caverns where they became larger and established themselves as the subterranean race of trolls , treasure-seeking miners and metalsmiths whose original links to the high ones were forgotten the main story begins 10,000 years later , with elves and other beings having adapted with great difficulty to their home she sank very deeply into her wolf-form and eventually forgot her original identity , even mating with a native wolf to produce a half-wolf chimeric son whom she handed over to the elves after teaching him as much as she could as a wolf they gave him the name timmorn yellow-eyes and he became the first chief of the wolfriders , bringing the wolf pack and the stranded elves together to form a close symbiotic alliance timmorn then went on to sire many children , with both wolves and elves ; as a result , the entire tribe and their bonded wolf pack can all trace their bloodline back to timmorn in some way by the point at which the series begins at the start of the story , the wolfriders ' regular forest life – intermittently interspersed by conflict with superstitiously genocidal humans – is lost when the humans set fire to the forest in retaliation for a previous battle if the two individuals are not temperamentally compatible , they may part ways again as soon as a child has been produced , but otherwise they may form a lifelong pair-bond as '' lifemates the love triangle between cutter , leetah and rayek is the main focus of much of the first part of the story ( savah , who is close to being a high one herself , possesses a magical ability known as '' going out '' where her spirit leaves her body in attempts to connect to other elves they created intricate art , such as the egg of six spheres , which recorded the elves ' history , but stopped growing winnowill put all gliders but the chosen eight into deep sleep , and attempted to use their magic powers to shape blue mountain into a vessel to leave the world of two moons originally a migrating tribe , the go-backs are named after a sudden desire to '' go back '' to the palace of the high ones while described as being in the '' very early planning stages '' , nothing further was ever mentioned about this project covering the first volume of the book , it consists of color still images taken straight from the comic , some minor animation , and spoken dialogue a proposed second series that would have included skywise among others never reached production in 2015 , cheeky dingo games released the elfquest adventure game , a cooperative board game , where the players take four elven characters on a campaign of adventures based on stories from the comic books as the elfquest series was quite popular in those days , dennis stoker , who sponsored and managed the experiment and a huge fan of the series , asked wendy pini to contribute to the experiment in designing an insignia the result is a circular insignia depicting the experiment , holding the names of the primary contributors ( including the university of iowa ) , set against a dark blue , star-spangled background and a unique elven character , wearing a green-and-black suit with star motifs accompanying the experiment the character , dubbed '' starfire '' , became a first in space , as never before was a comic-styled character ever created in reference to a space-going mission , and a first time it would actually be in space
