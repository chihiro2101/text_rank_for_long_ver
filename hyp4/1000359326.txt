larger airports usually have several runways in different directions , so that one can be selected that is most nearly aligned with the wind airports with one runway are often constructed to be aligned with the prevailing wind compiling a wind rose is in fact one of the preliminary steps taken in constructing airport runways originally in the 1920s and 1930s , airports and air bases ( particularly in the united kingdom ) were built in a triangle-like pattern of three runways at 60° angles to each other the reason was that back then aviation was only starting , and as a result although it was known that winds affect runway distance required , etc as a result , three runways in a triangle-like pattern were built , and the runway with the heaviest traffic on it would eventually expand into an airport 's main runway , while the other two runways would be either abandoned or converted into taxiways , '' runway 15 '' in one direction is '' runway 33 '' when used in the other it is very common in a country such as canada for a controller to clear an incoming american aircraft to , for example , runway 04 , and the pilot read back the clearance as runway & nbsp ; 4 military airbases may include smaller paved runways known as '' assault strips '' for practice and training next to larger primary runways these strips eschew the standard numerical naming convention and instead employ the runway 's full three digit heading ; examples include dobbins air reserve base 's runway 110/290and duke field 's runway 180/360 in some countries , regulations mandate that where parallel runways are too close to each other , only one may be used at a time under certain conditions ( usually adverse weather ) occasionally , an airport with only three parallel runways may use different runway identifiers , such as when a third parallel runway was opened at phoenix sky harbor international airport in 2000 to the south of existing 8r/26l—rather than confusingly becoming the '' new '' 8r/26l it was instead designated 7r/25l , with the former 8r/26l becoming 7l/25r and 8l/26r becoming 8/26 faa ac 150/5200-35 runways that are numbered relative to true north rather than magnetic north will use the suffix t ; this is advantageous for certain airfields in the far north such as thule air base depending on the airport location and how much drift occurs , it may be necessary to change the runway designation when a runway designation does change , especially at major airports , it is often done at night , because taxiway signs need to be changed and the huge numbers at each end of the runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators runway dimensions vary from as small as long and wide in smaller general aviation airports , to long and wide at large international airports built to accommodate the largest jets , to the huge lake bed runway 17/35 at edwards air force base in california – developed as a landing site for the space shuttle takeoff and landing distances available are given using one of the following terms : ; tora : takeoff run available – the length of runway declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane taking off ; lda : landing distance available – the length of runway that is declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane landing faa ac 150/5340-1l – standards for airport markings pages 13 and following the runway thresholds are markings across the runway that denote the beginning and end of the designated space for landing and takeoff under non-emergency conditions blast pads are often constructed just before the start of a runway where jet blast produced by large planes during the takeoff roll could otherwise erode the ground and eventually damage the runway stopways , also known as overrun areas , are also constructed at the end of runways as emergency space to slowly stop planes that overrun the runway on a landing that has not gone to plan , or to slowly stop a plane on a rejected takeoff or a takeoff that has not gone to plan the differences are that stopways can support the full weight of an aircraft and are designated for use in an aborted takeoff , while blast pads are often not as strong as the main paved surface of the runway and are not to be used for taxiing , landing , or aborted takeoffs a displaced threshold often exists because obstacles just before the runway , runway strength , or noise restrictions may make the beginning section of runway unsuitable for landings this sign uses a single number to indicate the remaining distance of the runway in thousands of feet these runways , depending on the surface , may be marked with threshold markings , designators , centerlines , and sometimes a mark ( known as an aiming point , sometimes installed at runways with one precision end and any other type of end can install the full set of touchdown zones , even if some are past the midpoint a line of lights on an airfield or elsewhere to guide aircraft in taking off or coming in to land or an illuminated runway is sometimes also known as a flare path land and hold short lights – a row of white pulsating lights installed across the runway to indicate hold short position on some runways that are facilitating land and hold short operations ( lahso ) approach lighting system ( als ) – a lighting system installed on the approach end of an airport runway and consists of a series of lightbars , strobe lights , or a combination of the two that extends outward from the runway end types of runway safety incidents include : runway excursion – an incident involving only a single aircraft , where it makes an inappropriate exit from the runway ( e.g larger aircraft including widebodies will usually require at least at sea level and somewhat more at higher altitude airports the boeing 747 is considered to have the longest takeoff distance of the more common aircraft types and has set the standard for runway lengths of larger international airports
