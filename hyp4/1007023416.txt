he later secured an indoor job as an office boy at the pleystowe sugar mill , where his colleagues include two future labor mps – maurice hynes and george martens according to his memoirs , fadden initially struggled to make ends meet as an accountant , and considered relocating to brisbane in parliament , fadden came to notice as a critic of the new government 's financial operations however , he lost to labor 's ted walsh by 224 votes , as the government won a landslide victory after losing his seat in state parliament , fadden moved to brisbane , and initially returned to his accounting practice in early 1936 , he joined the queensland country party , which had split from the cpnp in order to align with the federal country party it was caused by the death of the previous member , littleton groom , who was a member of the united australia party ( uap ) fadden , who had no previous connection with the area , was the first member of his party to contest the seat ; the uap suffered a negative swing of over 40 points he consolidated his hold on the seat at the 1937 federal election , held less than a year later in april 1939 , prime minister joseph lyons died in office and was replaced by country party leader earle page on an interim basis when robert menzies was elected by the united australia party ( uap ) as lyons ' replacement , page gave a speech accusing menzies of disloyalty and questioning his record of military service as a result of page 's attacks , which they deemed unfair , fadden and bernard corser resigned from the parliamentary country party to sit as '' independent country '' members ; they were soon followed by oliver badman and thomas collins archie cameron , generally seen as page 's ally , was elected as the party 's new leader in early november , however , cameron invited the four breakaways to rejoin the party in the interests of unity , which they accepted in march 1940 , menzies and cameron agreed to resume the coalition , providing an opportunity for five country party members to be added to the ministry the uap–country coalition was able to remain in power with the support of two independent mps , alexander wilson and arthur coles the country party lost three seats to the labor party , and on 16 october the parliamentary party voted to remove archie cameron as leader during a break for dinner , fadden was asked to become interim leader as a compromise between the two candidates , with the intention that another leadership election would be held in a few months according to his biographer tracey arklay , '' fadden was selected because the majority in the party room considered that he was the man most likely to be able to broker deals and negotiate with menzies and the uap '' he was sworn in as treasurer on 28 october 1940 , succeeding percy spender , and presented his first budget less than a month later on 21 november although the non-labor coalition had been in power for a decade , the uap was so bereft of leadership that on 28 august a joint uap-country meeting chose fadden as coalition leader even though the country party was the smaller of the two non-labor parties he was the only member of the country/national party to serve as prime minister without an expectation of a short tenure ( the other two country/national prime ministers , page and mcewen , served as caretakers ) it was later reported that fadden decided against moving into the lodge , the official prime minister 's residence in canberra , after his predecessor as country party leader , cameron , crudely told him that he would '' scarcely have enough time to wear a track from the backdoor to the shithouse before you ’ ll be out '' on 3 october , the two independents who had been keeping the coalition in office for the last year , coles and wilson , voted against fadden 's budget due to this loss of supply , fadden submitted his government 's resignation to the governor-general lord gowrie later the same day this was the last occasion to date on which an australian government was forced to resign after being defeated on the floor of the house of representatives however , he would have been left with no other option if labor leader john curtin did not have enough support to govern with this in mind , gowrie summoned coles and wilson and obtained their assurances that they would support curtin as prime minister and end the instability that had plagued the government since 1940 following the fall of his ministry , a joint uap-country party meeting endorsed fadden as leader of the opposition , even though the uap was nominally the senior coalition partner even allowing for curtin 's personal popularity , as well as the significant advantages which an incumbent government in a westminster system has in wartime , fadden proved a disappointment as leader of the opposition ; he was unable to get the better of curtin two years earlier , menzies had folded the uap into the new liberal party of australia there was some speculation that the country party would be included in the merger ( as had already happened in several states ) , but fadden was keen to assert the independence of his party '' fadden was a friend of robert frederick bird wake , one of the country 's leading security experts at the time the coalition won a massive victory in the 1949 election , and fadden , who transferred to the newly created seat of mcpherson on the gold coast , became treasurer in the second menzies government at the same time , he announced that he would retire from politics at the 1958 election although the election was held on 22 november , he did not resign from the ministry until 9 december , remaining in office as treasurer for over two weeks while not being a member of parliament having continued as treasurer after his resignation as country party leader it was unusual that the treasurer was a member of the junior party of the coalition who was not also the current party leader since fadden 's retirement , every treasurer in a coalition government has been a liberal
