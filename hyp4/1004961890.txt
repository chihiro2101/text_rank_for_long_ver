the contemporary classification of the polynesian languages began with certain observations by andrew pawley in 1966 based on shared innovations in phonology , vocabulary and grammar showing that the east polynesian languages were more closely related to samoan than they were to tongan , calling tongan and its nearby relative niuean '' tongic '' and samoan and all other polynesian languages of the study '' nuclear polynesian '' , 1963 , east polynesian relationships : settlement pattern and time involved as indicated by vocabulary agreements it began the process of extracting relationships from polynesian languages on small islands in melanesia , the '' polynesian outliers '' , whose languages pawley was able to trace to east futuna in the case of those farther south and perhaps to samoa itself in the case of those more to the north published a study of polynesian pronominal systems in 1985 suggesting that there was a special relationship between the east polynesian languages and all other nuclear polynesian but for futunic , and calling that extra-futunic group the '' ellicean languages '' furthermore , east polynesian was found to more likely have emerged from extra-samoan ellicean than out of samoa itself , an astonishing suggestion given the long assumption of a samoan homeland for the origins of east polynesian this was made possible by the massive polynesian language comparative lexicon ( '' pollex '' â€“ with reconstructions ) of biggs and clark despite the relative low number of polynesian languages , and the relative abundance of data already available on many of them , the comparative method was often reduced to comparisons of vocabulary , shared sporadic sound changes and , as wilson had done in 1985 , comparison of pronominal systems , which is perhaps the second most commonly described aspect of '' minor '' languages often available for comparison after the lexicostatistical lists massive lexicostatistical study of austronesian , for instance , showed a great deal of ( lexicostatistical ) diversity in the austronesian languages of western melanesia this was sometimes on par with the lexicostatistical distance of taiwan austronesian languages from other austronesian including taiwan austronesian languages from each other ( taiwan now definitively known to be the homeland of the language family itself ) but the low lexicostatistical agreement of many western melanesian oceanic languages with other oceanic austronesian can be easily dismissed as of little subgrouping interest because those languages are nevertheless full of diagnostic innovations of oceanic austronesian in their sound systems and vocabulary , including many oceanic lexical innovations found in the 100 and 200 lexicostatistical word lists ( and the deadly conclusive evidence of the shared phonological innovations of those low-scoring groups with all other oceanic austronesian ) they are just languages with accelerated loss of vocabulary , sometimes , in the western oceanic case , because they involve certain more ancient peoples of the region shifting to oceanic speech after oceanic-speaking peoples arrived partly because polynesian languages split from one another comparatively recently , many words in these languages remain similar to corresponding words in others by the time that linguists trained in more modern methods made their way to the pacific , at least for the major languages , the bible was already printed according to the orthographic system developed by the missionaries , and the people had learned to read and write without marking vowel length or the glottal stop despite efforts at reform by local academies , the general conservative resistance to orthographic change has led to varying results in polynesian languages , and several writing variants co-exist it is also used in many other polynesian languages , each of which has its own name for the character the latter method has come into common use in polynesian languages pacific languages : an introduction
