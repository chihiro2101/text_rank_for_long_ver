michael reilly , '' calculating the speed of sight '' , new scientist , july 28 , 2006 this manifests itself in a number of ways , but the most important in terms of producing moving images is the way that a series of still images displayed in quick succession will appear to be continuous smooth motion this would require three times the number of images to be sent in the same time , and thus greatly increase the amount of radio bandwidth required to send the complete signal and thus similarly increase the required radio spectrum early plans for color television in the united states included a move from very high frequency ( vhf ) to ultra high frequency ( uhf ) to open up additional spectrum but his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end , and could not have worked as he described it rca built just such a system in order to present the first electronically scanned color television demonstration on february 5 , 1940 , privately shown to members of the us federal communications commission at the rca plant in camden , new jersey in these systems the three colored images were sent one after each other , in either complete frames in the '' field-sequential color system '' , or for each line in the '' line-sequential '' system since three separate images were being sent in sequence , if they used existing monochrome radio signaling standards they would have an effective refresh rate of only 20 fields , or 10 frames , a second , well into the region where flicker would become visible current broadcasting 1940 '' color television success in test '' , the new york times , august 30 , 1940 , p '' new television system transmits images in full color '' , popular science , december 1940 , p cbs began experimental color field tests using film as early as august 28 , 1940 , and live cameras by november 12 '' color television success in test '' , the new york times , august 30 , 1940 , p ed reitan , rca-nbc color firsts in television ( commented ) these color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets , and as no color television sets were available to the public at this time , viewing of the color field tests was restricted to rca and cbs engineers and the invited press the war production board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from april 22 , 1942 , to august 20 , 1945 , limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public as early as 1940 , baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the '' telechrome '' baird 's demonstration on august 16 , 1944 , was the first example of a practical color television system work on the telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color baird television : the world 's first high definition colour television system similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 50s , differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns a solution was immediately forthcoming ; rapid development of radio receiver electronics during the war had opened a wide band of higher frequencies to practical use , and the fcc set aside a large section of these new uhf bands for television broadcast , and the fcc started to look at ways of using this newly available bandwidth for color broadcasts since no existing television would be able to tune in these stations , they were free to pick an incompatible system and allow the older vhf channels to die off over time cbs displayed improved versions of its original design , now using a single 6 & nbsp ; mhz channel ( like the existing black-and-white signals ) at 144 fields per second and 405 lines of resolution while the meetings were taking place it was widely known within the industry that rca was working on a dot-sequential system that was compatible with existing black-and-white broadcasts , but rca declined to demonstrate it during the first series of meetings the jtac still recommended the cbs system , and after the resolution of an ensuing rca lawsuit , color broadcasts using the cbs system started on june 25 , 1951 by this point the market had changed dramatically ; when color was first being considered in 1948 there were fewer than a million television sets in the u.s , where the programs could be viewed on eight 16-inch color receivers in a public building making them the first network color broadcasts after a series of hearings beginning in september 1949 , the fcc found the rca and cti systems fraught with technical problems , inaccurate color reproduction , and expensive equipment , and so formally approved the cbs system as the u.s an unsuccessful lawsuit by rca delayed the first commercial network broadcast in color until june 25 , 1951 , when a musical variety special titled simply premiere was shown over a network of five east coast cbs affiliates viewing was again restricted : the program could not be seen on black-and-white sets , and variety estimated that only thirty prototype color receivers were available in the new york area while the cbs color broadcasting schedule gradually expanded to twelve hours per week ( but never into prime time ) , ed reitan , '' progress of cbs colorcasting '' , programming for the cbs color system its commercial success was doomed by the lack of color receivers necessary to watch the programs , the refusal of television manufacturers to create adapter mechanisms for their existing black-and-white sets , '' cbs color system makes television set makers see red '' , the wall street journal , october 17 , 1950 , p three exceptions among the major television manufacturers were philco , which offered 11 models that could show cbs color broadcasts in black-and-white ; and westinghouse and admiral , which offered adapters to receive color broadcasts in black and white and in september 1951 , production began on the only cbs-columbia color television model , with the first color sets reaching retail stores on september 28 only 200 sets had been shipped , and only 100 sold , when cbs discontinued its color television system on october 20 , 1951 , ostensibly by request of the national production authority for the duration of the korean war , and bought back all the cbs color sets it could to prevent lawsuits by disappointed customers 5 '' color tv shelved as a defense step '' , the new york times , october 20 , 1951 , p '' action of defense mobilizer in postponing color tv poses many question for the industry '' , the new york times , october 22 , 1951 , p while the fcc was holding its jtac meetings , development was taking place on a number of systems allowing true simultaneous color broadcasts , '' dot-sequential color systems '' unlike the hybrid systems , dot-sequential televisions used a signal very similar to existing black-and-white broadcasts , with the intensity of every dot on the screen being sent in succession in 1938 georges valensi demonstrated an encoding scheme that would allow color broadcasts to be encoded so they could be picked up on existing black-and-white sets as well however , rca 's early sets using mirrors and other projection systems all suffered from image and color quality problems , and were easily bested by cbs 's hybrid system in spite of these problems in both the broadcast and display systems , rca pressed ahead with development and was ready for a second assault on the standards by 1950 the possibility of a compatible color broadcast system was so compelling that the ntsc decided to re-form , and held a second series of meetings starting in january 1950 television industry , represented by the ntsc , worked in 1950–1953 to develop a color system that was compatible with existing black-and-white sets and would pass fcc quality standards , with rca developing the hardware elements rca first made publicly announced field tests of the dot sequential color system over its new york station wnbc in july 1951 '' rca to test color tv system on three shows daily beginning today '' , the wall street journal , july 9 , 1951 , p rules color tv can go on air at once '' , the new york times , december 19 , 1953 , p the first publicly announced network demonstration of a program using the ntsc '' compatible color '' system was an episode of nbc 's kukla , fran and ollie on august 30 , 1953 , although it was viewable in color only at the network 's headquarters at the time that ntsc color broadcasting was officially introduced into canada in 1966 , less than one percent of canadian households had a color television set he obtained authorization to make the first publicly announced color broadcast in mexico , on february 8 , 1963 , of the program paraíso infantil on mexico city 's xhgc-tv , using the ntsc system which had by now been adopted as the standard for color programming although all-electronic color was introduced in the u.s it was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers , due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that autumn nbc made the first coast-to-coast color broadcast when it telecast the tournament of roses parade on january 1 , 1954 , with public demonstrations given across the united states on prototype color receivers by manufacturers rca , general electric , philco , raytheon , hallicrafters , hoffman , pacific mercury , and others two days earlier , admiral had demonstrated to their distributors the prototype of admiral 's first color television set planned for consumer sale using the ntsc standards , priced at 1,175 a color model from westinghouse h840ck15 ( 1,295 , or became available in the new york area on february 28 , 1954 ;
