the common rabbit is becoming so numerous throughout the colony , that they are running about on some large estates by thousands '' sydney gazette 28 may 1831 in the 1840s , rabbit-keeping became even more common , with examples of the theft of rabbits from ordinary peoples ' houses appearing in court records and rabbits entering the diets of ordinary people their population remained fairly stable until around 1866 , presumed to have been kept in check by native carnivores and were protected by an act of parliament , but by 1867 was out of control at the time , he had stated , '' the introduction of a few rabbits could do little harm and might provide a touch of home , in addition to a spot of hunting '' one theory as to why the barwon park rabbits adapted so well to australia is that the hybrid rabbits that resulted from the interbreeding of the two distinct types were much more suited to australian conditions the rabbits were extremely prolific creatures and spread rapidly across the southern parts of the country in a classic example of unintended consequences , rabbits had become so prevalent within 10 years of their introduction in 1859 that two million could be shot or trapped annually without having any noticeable effect on the population the extent of plant species ' loss is unknown at this time , though rabbits are known to often kill young trees in orchards , forests , and on properties by ringbarking them australian encyclopaedia , vol , vii , grolier society , sydney rabbits are also responsible for serious erosion problems , as they eat native plants , leaving the topsoil exposed and vulnerable to sheet , gully , and wind erosion by 1887 , losses from rabbit damage compelled the new south wales government to offer a Â£25,000 reward for '' any method of success not previously known in the colony for the effectual extermination of rabbits '' once the problem was understood , various control methods were tried to limit or reduce the population of rabbits in australia shooting rabbits is one of the most common control methods and can successfully be used to keep already low populations in check whilst providing food for people or pets , though it is ineffective for large-scale eradication poisoning is probably the most widely used of the conventional techniques , as it requires the least effort , and capable of destroying a local population , though reinfestation given the mobility of the animal is almost inevitable since the number of rabbits ferrets can kill is limited , this is more a hunting activity than a serious control method although ferrets and other mustelid species are used as control measures , australia has significantly fewer wild mustelids to prey on the invasive rabbits while in their warrens or burrows compared to europe and the united states historically , trapping was also frequently used ; steel-jawed leg-holding traps were banned in most states in the 1980s on animal-cruelty grounds , though trapping continues at a lower level using rubber-jawed traps given that european rabbits can both jump very high and burrow underground , a perfectly intact fence stretching for hundreds of kilometres , and whose gates farmers or graziers did not leave open for livestock or machinery , was still unlikely to succeed releasing rabbit-borne diseases has proven somewhat successful in controlling the population of rabbits in australia , but such success as has been achieved did not occur as quickly as was hoped on 16 april 1888 , the new south wales government appointed a royal commission '' to make a full and diligent inquiry as to whether or not the introduction of contagious diseases amongst rabbits by inoculation or otherwise , or the propagation of diseases natural to rabbits dr danysz felt that broughton island was a poor choice of test site , and that extensive experiments should be conducted on the mainland frank tidswell , who was his chief australian collaborator , continued danysz 's trials after he left in 1907 , and also began trials of the yalgogrin , gundagai , and picton microbes ( named for the stations where infected rabbits were found ) , but financial support was lacking from the federal government , or the collaboration of affected states , that would be necessary to prove that the measure safe and effective for this reason , biological warfare against rabbits in australia is a serious concern for conservation activities in other parts of the world
