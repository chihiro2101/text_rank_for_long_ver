different regions of latin america and the united states have distinct salsa styles of their own , such as cuban , colombian , new york style & la style others believe that the term was created by record labels to better market their music , who chose the word '' salsa '' because of its spicy and hot connotations still , others believe the term came about because salsa dancing and music is a mixture of different styles , just like salsa or '' sauce '' in latin american countries is a mixture of different ingredients in some styles of salsa , such as the new york style , the dancers remain mostly in front of one another ( switching places ) , while in latin american styles , such as cuban style , the dancers circle around each other , sometimes in 3 points the point in a musical bar music where a slightly larger step is taken ( the break step ) and the direction the step moves can often be used to identify a style every salsa composition involves complex afro-cuban percussion based around the clave rhythm ( which has four types ) , though there can be moments when the clave is hidden for a while , often when quoting charanga , changüí and bomba however it is taboo to play or dance to the wrong type of clave rhythm ( see salsa music ) alternatively , others use the conga rhythm to create a jazzier feel to their dance since strong '' off-beats '' are a jazz element the basic salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music the point in a musical bar music where a slightly larger step is taken ( the break step ) and the direction the step moves can often be used to identify a style the afro-latino style is a very popular kind of salsa originating from influences of afro-cuban dances.it pretty much involves the same dancing as most versions of the salsa but has a little bit of twist added to it the thing that separates it and gives it its own identity is that some of the songs tie in an african language and certain african instruments that gives the songs different rhythms the name casino is derived from the spanish term for the dance halls , '' casinos deportivos '' where much social dancing was done among the better-off , white cubans during the mid-20th century and onward in this way , rather than following a beat , the dancers themselves contribute in their movement , to the polyrythmic pattern of the music what gives the dance its life , however , is not its mechanical technique , but understanding and spontaneous use of the rich afro-cuban dance vocabulary within a '' casino '' dance in the same way that a '' sonero '' ( lead singer in son and salsa bands ) will '' quote '' other , older songs in their own , a '' casino '' dancer will frequently improvise references to other dances , integrating movements , gestures and extended passages from the folkloric and popular heritage developed by cuban immigrants to florida and centered on miami , this dance style is a fusion of some elements from casino with many elements from american culture and dances a major difference between cali style and miami-style is the latter is exclusively danced on the downbeat ( on1 ) and has elements of shines and show-style added to it , following repertoires of north american styles pairs of dancers form a circle ( '' rueda '' in spanish means '' wheel '' ) , with dance moves called out by one person the los angeles salsa style ( la style ) is danced strictly on 1 , in a slot \ line , using elements of various north american and stage dances the lifts , stunts and aerial works of today 's salsa shows are derived mostly from la style forms with origins in latin ballroom and ballet lifts unlike other styles of salsa , new york style is danced on the second beat of the music ( '' on 2 '' ) , and the follower , not the leader , steps forward on the first measure of the music there is greater emphasis on performing '' shines '' in which dancers separate themselves and dance solo with intricate footwork and styling for a time—a phenomenon that likely has origins from swing and new york tap there are two distinct developments of new york salsa as a music and dance genre : primary evolution from mambo era was introduced to new york due to influx of migrating dissidents from all the caribbean and other latin migrants during pre/post cuban revolution in the 1950s and 1960s at this time , the music and dance was called '' mambo '' —connoting the general term without being specific these two developments create a fusion of a new salsa music and dance genre , different from its latin american and caribbean counterparts new york style salsa emphasizes harmony with the percussive instruments in salsa music , such as the congas , timbales , and clave , since many or all of those instruments often mark the second beat in the music
