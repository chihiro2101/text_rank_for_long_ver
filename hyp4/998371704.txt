stradivari made his instruments using an inner form , unlike the french copyists , such as vuillaume , who employed an outer form it is clear from the number of forms throughout his career that he experimented with some of the dimensions of his instruments there has been conjecture that the wood used may have been treated with several types of minerals , both before and after construction of a violin these results suggest that differences in density differentials in the material may have played a significant role in the sound production of classical violins a later survey , focused on comparing median densities in both classical and modern violin examples , questioned the role available materials may have played in sound production differences , though it made no comment on variations in density differentials stolen instruments are often recovered , however , even after being missing for many years above all , these instruments are famous for the quality of sound they produce a committee of scientists and musicians , listening to the violins played in an adjacent room , judged chanot 's violin to be at least as good as the stradivarius , but apparently chanot 's instruments quickly lost their good qualities to the present ( as of 2014 ) have never found any difference in sound between stradivari 's violins and high-quality violins in comparable style of other makers and periods , nor has acoustic analysis one of rhonheimer 's violins , made with wood that the empa ( swiss federal laboratories for materials science and technology ) researcher francis schwarze had treated with fungi , received 90 of the 180 votes for the best tone , while the stradivarius came second with 39 votes in a double-blind test in 2012 published in the study '' player preferences among new and old violins '' , expert players could not distinguish old from new instruments by playing them for a short time in a small room in an additional test , performed in a concert hall , one of the stradivarius violins placed first , but one of the participants stated that '' the audience in the concert hall were essentially equivocal on which instruments were better in each of the pair-wise instrument comparisons '' and '' i could tell slight differences in the instruments none of them sounded substantially weaker than the others '' modern violins were rated as having better sound-carrying qualities and were preferred again in a study in 2017 further evidence for this '' little ice age theory '' comes from a simple examination of the dense growth rings in the wood used in stradivari 's instruments joseph nagyvary reveals that he has always held the belief that there are a wide range of chemicals that will improve the violin 's sound '' secrets of stradivarius ' unique violin sound revealed , professor says '' , science daily 25 january 2009 in january 2019 , four musicians will record an extensive set of scales and arpeggios in different techniques to showcase the sounds produced by two violins , a viola , and a cello these recordings , known as the '' stradivarius sound bank '' , will be part of a permanent collection at the museo del violino that will allow future generations to hear stradivarius instruments a fourdoc ( short on-line documentary ) about a group of violin makers making a violin in the original spec of the maurin stradivarius in just five days what makes a stradivarius so great ? cozio.com online database of instruments by antonio stradivari how stradivari and guarneri got their music discusses the chemical techniques used to figure out what makes these instruments ' unique sound
