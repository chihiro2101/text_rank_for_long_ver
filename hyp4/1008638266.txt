the working principle involves the acceleration of an electrically conductive fluid ( which can be a liquid or an ionized gas called a plasma ) by the lorentz force , resulting from the cross product of an electric current ( motion of charge carriers accelerated by an electric field applied between two electrodes ) with a perpendicular magnetic field this is the same working principle as an electric motor ( more exactly a linear motor ) except that in an mhd drive , the solid moving rotor is replaced by the fluid acting directly as the propellant mhd thrusters are classified in two categories according to the way the electromagnetic fields operate : conduction devices when a direct current flows in the fluid due to an applied voltage between pairs of electrodes , the magnetic field being steady since one of the biggest issues with such thrusters is the limited energy available on-board , induction mhd drives have not been developed out of the laboratory both systems can put the working fluid in motion according to two main designs : internal flow when the fluid is accelerated within and propelled back out of a nozzle of tubular or ring-shaped cross-section , the mhd interaction being concentrated within the pipe ( similarly to rocket or jet engines ) first studies of the interaction of plasmas with hypersonic speed around vehicles date back to the late 1950s , with the concept of a new kind of thermal protection system for space capsules during high-speed reentry active flow control by mhd force fields on the contrary involves a direct and imperious action of forces to locally accelerate or slow down the airflow , modifying its velocity , direction , pressure , friction , heat flux parameters , in order to preserve materials and engines from stress , allowing hypersonic flight some theoretical studies suggest the flow velocity could be controlled everywhere on the wetted area of an aircraft , so shock waves could be totally cancelled when using enough power such studies covers a field of resistive mhd with magnetic reynolds number ≪ 1 using nonthermal weakly ionized gases , making the development of demonstrators much more difficult to realize than for mhd in liquids mhd propulsion has been considered as the main propulsion system for both marine and space ships since there is no need to produce lift to counter the gravity of earth in water ( due to buoyancy ) nor in space ( due to weightlessness ) , which is ruled out in the case of flight in the atmosphere nonetheless , considering the current problem of the electric power solved ( for example with the availability of a still missing multi-megawatt compact fusion power ) , one could imagine future aircraft of a new kind silently powered by mhd accelerators , able to ionize and direct enough air downward to lift several tonnes as external flow systems can control the flow over the whole wetted area , limiting thermal issues at high speeds , ambient air would be ionized and radially accelerated by lorentz forces around an axisymmetric body ( shaped as a cylinder , a cone , a sphere… ) , the entire airframe being the engine such systems provide greater thrust and higher specific impulse than conventional chemical rockets and even modern ion drives , at the cost of a higher required energy density even today , these systems are not ready to be launched in space as they still lack a suitable compact power source offering enough energy density ( such as hypothetical fusion power ) to feed the power-greedy electromagnets , especially pulsed inductive ones in reality , the current traveling through the water would create gases and noise , and the magnetic fields would induce a detectable magnetic signature
