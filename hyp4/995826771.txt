eventually , time signals from gbr were terminated in november 1986 and it is no longer used as a frequency reference on 27 february 2007 the npl started tests of the new time signal transmissions from anthorn the official history of the service says that '' rugby was given an additional commitment for the transmission of reference modulated standard frequencies '' , but no actual explanation is given for the call sign '' msf '' in addition to professional uses where accurate time is required , radio-controlled clocks with both digital and analog displays using the npl signal are widely used ( similar clocks are available in other regions with standard time transmissions ) as far as users are concerned they are simply clocks with the same features and settings as others , but always display the right time , and correct themselves for summer time currently , the signal is encoded as follows : the msf transmitter is switched off for brief intervals ( on-off keying ) near the beginning of each second to encode the current time and date the second marker is transmitted with an accuracy better than ±1 ms relative to coordinated universal time ( utc ) , which is itself always within ±0.9 seconds of ut1 ( ut1 ) which is the mean solar time which would actually be observed at 0° longitude the other 59 ( or , exceptionally , 60 or 58 ) seconds of the minute always begin with at least 100 ms 'off ' , followed by two data bits of 100 & nbsp ; ms each , and end with at least 700 & nbsp ; ms of carrier although two data bits are transmitted per second , the time code has the property that only one of them is variable ; non-zero b bits are only transmitted when the corresponding a bit has a fixed value seconds 01–16 carry information for the current minute about the difference ( dut1 ) between atomic and astronomical time , and the remaining seconds convey the time and date code the time and date code information begins 43 seconds before the corresponding minute marker ( second 17 of the previous minute , in the absence of leap seconds ) , and is always given in terms of uk civil time , which is utc in winter and utc+1h when summer time is in effect bit 58b indicates the broadcast time is summer time the only indication is a change in the number of padding bits before the time code during the minute before the leap second therefore , unless a leap-second announcement is manually entered into a receiver in advance , it may take some time until an autonomous msf receiver regains synchronization with utc after a leap second ( especially if the reception is not robust at the time of the leap second ) the time signal only provides 1 hour warning of summer-time changes
