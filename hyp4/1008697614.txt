the project was started in 1998 , when intel saw the pentium ii as their permanent line the pentium iii remained intel 's top selling processor line , with the athlon also selling slightly better than the pentium 4 while intel bundled two rdram modules with each boxed pentium 4 , it did not facilitate pentium 4 sales and was not considered a true solution by many in january 2001 , a still slower 1.3 & nbsp ; ghz model was added to the range , but over the next twelve months , intel gradually started reducing amd 's leadership in performance in april 2001 a 1.7 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 was launched , the first model to provide performance clearly superior to the old pentium iii in the same month , they released the 815 chipset that supported much cheaper pc133 sdram instead of rdram the new chipset allowed the pentium 4 to quickly replace the pentium iii , becoming the top-selling mainstream processor on the market the battle for performance leadership remained competitive ( as amd introduced faster versions of the athlon xp ) but most observers agreed that the fastest-clocked northwood-based pentium 4 was usually ahead of its rival this was particularly so in mid-2002 , when amd 's changeover to its 130 & nbsp ; nm production process did not help the initial '' thoroughbred a '' revision athlon xp cpus to clock high enough to overcome the advantages of northwood in the 2.4 to 2.8 & nbsp ; ghz range the 3.06 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 enabled hyper-threading technology that was first supported in foster-based xeons this initial 3.06 & nbsp ; ghz 533fsb pentium 4 hyper-threading enabled processor was known as pentium 4 ht and was introduced to mass market by gateway in november 2002 while the athlon xp architecture was less dependent on bandwidth , the bandwidth numbers reached by intel were well out of range for the athlon 's ev6 bus also based on the northwood core , the mobile intel pentium 4 processor - m was released on april 23 , 2002 and included intel 's speedstep and deeper sleep technologies intel 's naming conventions made it difficult at the time of the processor 's release to identify the processor model the mobile intel pentium 4 processor was released to address the problem of putting a full desktop pentium 4 processor into a laptop , which some manufacturers were doing the design was mostly identical to pentium 4 ( to the extent that it would run in the same motherboards ) , but differed by an added 2 & nbsp ; mb of level 3 cache multimedia encoding and certain games benefited the most , with the extreme edition outperforming the pentium 4 , and even the two athlon 64 variants , although the lower price and more balanced performance of the athlon 64 ( particularly the non-fx version ) led to it usually being seen as the better value proposition nonetheless , the extreme edition did achieve intel 's apparent aim , which was to prevent amd from being the performance champion with the new athlon 64 , which was winning every single major benchmark over the existing pentium 4s by most metrics , this was on a per-clock basis the fastest single-core netburst processor that was ever produced , even outperforming many of its successor chips ( not counting the dual-core pentium d ) in practice however , the 3.73 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 extreme edition almost always proved to be slower than the 3.46 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 extreme edition , which is most likely due to the lack of an l3 cache and the longer instruction pipeline the only advantage the 3.73 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 extreme edition had over the 3.46 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 extreme edition was the ability to run 64-bit applications since all gallatin-based pentium 4 extreme edition processors lacked the intel 64 instruction set although never a particularly good seller , especially since it was released in a time when amd was asserting near total dominance in the processor performance race , the pentium 4 extreme edition established a new position within intel 's product line , that of an enthusiast oriented chip with the highest-end specifications offered by intel chips , along with unlocked multipliers to allow for easier overclocking in this role it has since been succeeded by the pentium extreme edition ( the extreme version of the dual-core pentium d ) , the core 2 extreme , the core i7 and most recently , the core i9 the core used the 90 & nbsp ; nm process for the first time , which one analyst described as '' a major reworking of the pentium 4 's microarchitecture plans to mass-produce a 4 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 were cancelled by intel in favor of dual core processors , although some european retailers claimed to be selling a pentium 4 580 , clocked at 4 & nbsp ; ghz intel also released a series of prescott supporting intel 64 , intel 's implementation of the amd-developed x86-64 64-bit extensions to the x86 architecture however , higher cache latency and the double word size , if using intel 64 mode , negated any advantage that added cache introduced however , it was cancelled a few months after the release of prescott due to extremely high tdps ( a 2.8 & nbsp ; ghz tejas emitted 150 w of heat , compared to around 80 w for a northwood of the same speed , and 100 w for a comparably clocked prescott ) and development on the netburst microarchitecture as a whole ceased , with the exception of the dual-core pentium d and pentium extreme edition and the cedar mill-based pentium 4 ht since may 2005 , intel has released dual-core processors under the pentium d and pentium extreme edition brands intel core 2 processors have been released as single , dual and quad core processors
