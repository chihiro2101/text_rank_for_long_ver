Transport Layer Security

description . client-server applications use the tls protocol to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping and tampering . since applications can communicate either with or without tls ( or ssl ) , it is necessary for the client to indicate to the server the setup of a tls connection . one of the main ways of achieving this is to use a different port number for tls connections , for example port 443 for https . another mechanism is for the client to make a protocol-specific request to the server to switch the connection to tls ; for example , by making a starttls request when using the mail and news protocols . once the client and server have agreed to use tls , they negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure . '' ssl/tls in detail '' . microsoft technet . updated july 30 , 2003 . the protocols use a handshake with an asymmetric cipher to establish not only cipher settings but also a session-specific shared key with which further communication is encrypted using a symmetric cipher . during this handshake , the client and server agree on various parameters used to establish the connection 's security : the handshake begins when a client connects to a tls-enabled server requesting a secure connection and the client presents a list of supported cipher suites ( ciphers and hash functions ) . from this list , the server picks a cipher and hash function that it also supports and notifies the client of the decision . the server usually then provides identification in the form of a digital certificate . the certificate contains the hostname , the trusted certificate authority ( ca ) that vouches for the authenticity of the certificate , and the server 's public encryption key . the client confirms the validity of the certificate before proceeding . to generate the session keys used for the secure connection , the client either : encrypts a random number with the server 's public key and sends the result to the server ( which only the server should be able to decrypt with its private key ) ; both parties then use the random number to generate a unique session key for subsequent encryption and decryption of data during the session uses diffieâ€“hellman key exchange to securely generate a random and unique session key for encryption and decryption that has the additional property of forward secrecy : if the server 's private key is disclosed in future , it can not be used to decrypt the current session , even if the session is intercepted and recorded by a third party . this concludes the handshake and begins the secured connection , which is encrypted and decrypted with the session key until the connection closes . if any one of the above steps fails , then the tls handshake fails and the connection is not created . tls and ssl do not fit neatly into any single layer of the osi model or the tcp/ip model . tls runs '' on top of some reliable transport protocol ( e.g . , tcp ) , '' which would imply that it is above the transport layer . it serves encryption to higher layers , which is normally the function of the presentation layer . however , applications generally use tls as if it were a transport layer , even though applications using tls must actively control initiating tls handshakes and handling of exchanged authentication certificates . . history and development . ; length : length of application data ( excluding the protocol header and including the mac and padding trailers ) ; mac : 32 bytes for the sha-256-based hmac , 20 bytes for the sha-1-based hmac , 16 bytes for the md5-based hmac . ; padding : variable length ; last byte contains the padding length . support for name-based virtual servers . from the application protocol point of view , tls belongs to a lower layer , although the tcp/ip model is too coarse to show it . this means that the tls handshake is usually ( except in the starttls case ) performed before the application protocol can start . in the name-based virtual server feature being provided by the application layer , all co-hosted virtual servers share the same certificate because the server has to select and send a certificate immediately after the clienthello message . this is a big problem in hosting environments because it means either sharing the same certificate among all customers or using a different ip address for each of them . there are two known workarounds provided by x.509 : if all virtual servers belong to the same domain , a wildcard certificate can be used . besides the loose host name selection that might be a problem or not , there is no common agreement about how to match wildcard certificates . different rules are applied depending on the application protocol or software used . add every virtual host name in the subjectaltname extension . the major problem being that the certificate needs to be reissued whenever a new virtual server is added . to provide the server name , transport layer security ( tls ) extensions allow clients to include a server name indication extension ( sni ) in the extended clienthello message . this extension hints to the server immediately which name the client wishes to connect to , so the server can select the appropriate certificate to send to the clients . also documents a method to implement name-based virtual hosting by upgrading http to tls via an http/1.1 upgrade header . normally this is to securely implement http over tls within the main '' http '' uri scheme ( which avoids forking the uri space and reduces the number of used ports ) , however , few implementations currently support this . standards . primary standards . the current approved version of tls is version 1.3 , which is specified in : : ''

transport layer security ( tls ) , and its now-deprecated predecessor , secure sockets layer ( ssl ) , are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network . several versions of the protocols are widely used in applications such as email , instant messaging , and voice over ip , but its use as the security layer in https remains the most publicly visible . the tls protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications . when secured by tls , connections between a client ( e.g . , a web browser ) and a server ( e.g . , wikipedia.org ) should have one or more of the following properties : the connection is private ( or secure ) because a symmetric-key algorithm is used to encrypt the data transmitted . the keys for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based on a shared secret that was negotiated at the start of the session . the server and client negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of data is transmitted ( see below ) . the negotiation of a shared secret is both secure ( the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and can not be obtained , even by an attacker who places themself in the middle of the connection ) and reliable ( no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected ) . the identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using public-key cryptography . this authentication is required for the server and optional for the client . the connection is reliable because each message transmitted includes a message integrity check using a message authentication code to prevent undetected loss or alteration of the data during transmission . in addition to the above , careful configuration of tls can provide additional privacy-related properties such as forward secrecy , ensuring that any future disclosure of encryption keys can not be used to decrypt any tls communications recorded in the past . tls supports many different methods for exchanging keys , encrypting data , and authenticating message integrity ( see below ) . as a result , secure configuration of tls involves many configurable parameters , and not all choices provide all of the privacy-related properties described in the list above ( see the Â§ key exchange ( authentication ) , Â§ cipher security , and Â§ data integrity tables ) . attempts have been made to subvert aspects of the communications security that tls seeks to provide , and the protocol has been revised several times to address these security threats . developers of web browsers have repeatedly revised their products to defend against potential security weaknesses after these were discovered ( see tls/ssl support history of web browsers ) . the tls protocol comprises two layers : the tls record and the tls handshake protocols . tls is a proposed internet engineering task force ( ietf ) standard , first defined in 1999 , and the current version is tls 1.3 defined in august 2018 . tls builds on the earlier ssl specifications ( 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) developed by netscape communications for adding the https protocol to their navigator web browser .
